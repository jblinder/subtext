"8",146000,148960,"We didn't cometo dig in Egypt for medals.","The Mummy"
"9",149000,151480,"Much more is learnedfrom bits of broken pottery","The Mummy"
"10",151600,153800,"than from all the sensational finds.","The Mummy"
"11",153920,157000,"Our job is to increasethe sum of human knowledge of the past,","The Mummy"
"12",157080,159000,"not to satisfy our own curiosity.","The Mummy"
"13",159040,162960,"Oh, that's all very true, Sir Joseph,but, after all, we're human.","The Mummy"
"14",163000,166200,"- And a find like this! How can you wait?- This is your first trip.","The Mummy"
"15",166280,169680,"I've been here ten years. I'm morecurious about the mummy than you.","The Mummy"
"16",169720,171800,"And even more about that box.","The Mummy"
"17",171920,173680,"- Whemple.- Yes?","The Mummy"
"18",174080,175760,"The viscera were not removed.","The Mummy"
"19",175880,179000,"The usual scar madeby the embalmer's knife is not there.","The Mummy"
"20",179040,180560,"I guessed as much, Muller.","The Mummy"
"21",186040,188760,"I had a good look at himwhen I photographed him.","The Mummy"
"22",188800,191080,"Never saw a mummy like that.","The Mummy"
"23",191120,193560,"Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.","The Mummy"
"24",193600,198000,"Looks as though he died in somesensationally unpleasant manner.","The Mummy"
"25",199880,203720,"The contorted muscles showthat he struggled in the bandages.","The Mummy"
"26",203840,205800,"Buried alive?","The Mummy"

"29",216760,220600,"Poor old fella. Now, what could you havedone to make 'em treat you like that?","The Mummy"
"30",220640,222960,"An execution for treason, I suppose.","The Mummy"
"31",224200,226240,"Sacrilege, more likely.","The Mummy"
"32",226360,231320,"Look. Sacred spells which protectthe soul in its journey to the underworld","The Mummy"
"33",231440,233640,"have been chipped off the coffin.","The Mummy"
"34",233680,237880,"So Imhotep was sentenced to deathnot only in this world, but in the next.","The Mummy"
"35",238000,241440,"Maybe he got too gaywith the vestal virgins in the temple.","The Mummy"
"36",241480,246000,"Possibly. The priestesses of the Templeof Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh.","The Mummy"
"37",246080,248040,"They were the secret virgins of Isis.","The Mummy"
"38",248680,251440,"Maybe the answer'sin that box we found buried with him.","The Mummy"
"39",251480,254720,"I see I shall get no more workout of you until after it's open.","The Mummy"
"40",254760,258280,"- Come on.- Let's have the box.","The Mummy"
"41",259600,263160,"Oh dear. The wood's so rottenit'll fall apart at a touch.","The Mummy"

"51",338120,340520,"- Well, let's see what's inside!- Wait!","The Mummy"
"52",340640,343200,"You will break the curse.","The Mummy"
"53",343240,346840,"We recognise your masteryof the occult sciences, Muller.","The Mummy"
"54",346920,349360,"But your beliefs can'tinterfere with my work.","The Mummy"
"55",349400,352920,"- Then why did you send for me today?- As a friend and an expert.","The Mummy"
"56",352960,355560,"This find was uniqueand I wanted your opinion.","The Mummy"
"57",355680,358320,"- It's providential that you did.- Oh, come, Dr Muller.","The Mummy"
"58",358440,362200,"Surely a few thousand years in the earthtake the mumbo jumbo off any old curse.","The Mummy"
"59",362280,364200,"Oh, I cannot speak before a boy.","The Mummy"
"60",364920,367080,"Come out under the stars of Egypt.","The Mummy"
"61",369040,371080,"Do not touch that casket.","The Mummy"
"62",375320,378200,"Go on with your cataloguing.We'll open it later.","The Mummy"
"63",378240,380560,"Don't think you canpersuade me not to examine","The Mummy"
"64",380680,384240,"the most wonderful findof my whole experience out here.","The Mummy"
"65",393800,398480,"If you are right about the legend, then thiscasket may contain the Scroll of Thoth,","The Mummy"
"66",398520,402360,"from the holy of holies in the temple, andI can hardly wait to get back to find out.","The Mummy"
"67",402480,406200,"The gods of Egypt still live in these hills,in their ruined temples.","The Mummy"
"68",406320,409480,"The ancient spells are weaker,but some of them are still potent.","The Mummy"
"69",409600,412880,"And I believe that you havein your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,","The Mummy"
"70",412920,416600,"which contains the great spell with whichIsis raised Osiris from the dead.","The Mummy"
"71",538720,541720,"Put it back. Bury it where you found it.","The Mummy"
"72",541840,544840,"You have read the curse.You dare defy it?","The Mummy"
"73",545040,548440,"In the interests of science,even if I believed in the curse,","The Mummy"
"74",548520,550720,"I'd go on with my work for the museum.","The Mummy"
"75",550760,554040,"Come back with me and we'llexamine this great find together.","The Mummy"
"76",554200,557720,"I cannot condonean act of sacrilege with my presence.","The Mummy"
"77",670640,673880,"What's the matter, man?For heaven's sakes, what is it?","The Mummy"
"78",674320,677520,"He... He went for a little walk!","The Mummy"
"79",678600,680800,"You should have seen his face!","The Mummy"
"80",730160,733760,"Here's something to break the monotony.A visitor coming from the Nile.","The Mummy"
"81",733880,737040,"- Colour? Nationality?- How could I see in that glare?","The Mummy"
"82",737160,739360,"Well, Whemple, back we go to London.","The Mummy"
"83",739480,744440,"And what fools we look. Money wasted.Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.","The Mummy"
"84",745080,747040,"A few beads. A few broken pots.","The Mummy"
"85",747720,749920,"A man needs morethan hard work for this game.","The Mummy"
"86",750040,753360,"He needs flair.He needs luck. Like your father.","The Mummy"
"87",753480,756200,"When he came here,there wasn't so much competition.","The Mummy"
"88",756240,762000,"When he did, he found things. And once,ten years ago, he found too much.","The Mummy"
"89",762080,766960,"Was it ten years? Queer story, that youngOxford chap he had with him going mad.","The Mummy"
"90",767080,769080,"- You know what I think it was?- No. What?","The Mummy"
"91",769120,773600,"He went crazy. Bored beyond humanendurance in this sand and these rocks.","The Mummy"
"92",773640,778600,"He was laughing when your father foundhim. He died laughing, in a straitjacket.","The Mummy"
"93",778680,780600,"Your father never explained.","The Mummy"
"94",780640,785120,"But when the best excavator Englandhas turned out, a man who loved Egypt,","The Mummy"
"95",785160,788440,"said he'd never come back here,that meant something.","The Mummy"
"96",794080,796120,"Come in.","The Mummy"
"97",804760,807800,"You break your season's camp,Professor Pearson?","The Mummy"

"101",816720,820560,"Scarcely.Here are the season's finds.","The Mummy"
"102",820960,824560,"Permit me to present youwith the most sensational find","The Mummy"
"103",824680,826880,"since that of Tutankhamen.","The Mummy"
"104",827000,829480,"This is very sporting of you!May I ask why?","The Mummy"
"105",829600,834160,"We Egyptians are not permittedto dig up our ancient dead.","The Mummy"
"106",834280,837040,"Only... foreign museums.","The Mummy"
"107",838400,839800,"What's this?","The Mummy"
"108",839880,843880,"Part of the funerary equipmentof the princess Anck-es-en-Amon.","The Mummy"
"109",844600,848520,"- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.- Yes. It's her name.","The Mummy"
"110",848640,852640,"I found that not 100 yardsfrom where we are.","The Mummy"
"111",852680,856640,"- You mean you think her tomb is there?- I will show you where to dig.","The Mummy"
"112",858320,862120,"I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...?I didn't catch your name.","The Mummy"
"113",862240,864200,"Ardath Bey.","The Mummy"
"114",880080,883680,"Circumstantial evidence.Not very strong, perhaps.","The Mummy"
"115",883800,886680,"But if we put that gangof diggers from Kerma on the job,","The Mummy"
"116",886760,889520,"we can tell in two daysif there's anything here.","The Mummy"
"117",889560,891320,"In one day, Professor.","The Mummy"
"118",932360,935240,"- It's a step.- He was right.","The Mummy"
"119",935360,937320,"Anyhow, we've found something.","The Mummy"

"128",1094480,1097080,"Are we really inthis dreadful modern Cairo?","The Mummy"
"129",1097920,1101200,"Your thoughts are far from the danceand these nice English boys.","The Mummy"
"130",1101320,1103760,"Not really. I'm having a lovely time.","The Mummy"
"131",1103800,1105840,"- I'm so grateful.- But why?","The Mummy"
"132",1105960,1108000,"Your keeping me here with you,of course.","The Mummy"
"133",1108040,1111640,"So I don't have to go up to Fatherin that beastly hot Sudan.","The Mummy"
"134",1112120,1115320,"It's I who am grateful.My most interesting patient.","The Mummy"
"135",1121360,1123320,"Know who that is?","The Mummy"
"136",1124520,1126320,"- Muller of Vienna.- Really?","The Mummy"

"141",1153880,1156320,"Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.","The Mummy"
"142",1156440,1158240,"I did not notice the time.","The Mummy"

"148",1179400,1181560,"Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.","The Mummy"

"155",1211760,1214880,"But I must see you again.You must come to my house.","The Mummy"
"156",1214920,1218360,"I regret I am too occupiedto accept invitations.","The Mummy"
"157",1225720,1227920,"He's a strange one.","The Mummy"
"158",1228040,1231760,"You might have thanked him. He wasresponsible for finding the princess.","The Mummy"
"159",1231880,1233800,"Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.","The Mummy"
"160",1233840,1236800,"It's a dirty trick,Cairo Museum keeping what we've found.","The Mummy"
"161",1236840,1241640,"That was the contract. The BritishMuseum works for science, not for loot.","The Mummy"

"185",1450960,1455160,"And the name of a man unspokensince before the siege of Troy.","The Mummy"
"186",1499360,1501840,"- Is your master at home?- Yes, sir.","The Mummy"
"187",1501880,1504600,"Tell him Dr Muller wishesto see him urgently.","The Mummy"

"189",1515280,1517240,"You fainted.","The Mummy"
"190",1521480,1523520,"But how did you guess she was here?","The Mummy"
"191",1523560,1526960,"I discovered that she took a taxifrom the hotel to the museum.","The Mummy"
"192",1527080,1530360,"I went there. The watchman saidshe had left in your car.","The Mummy"
"193",1532560,1537200,"Before you take her away, I must talkto you about something she said just now.","The Mummy"

"197",1556720,1559840,"That seems so formal underthese peculiar circumstances.","The Mummy"
"198",1559880,1563040,"And now, if you're all right again,back we go to the hotel.","The Mummy"
"199",1563160,1565880,"I think she'll want to rest a few minutes.","The Mummy"
"200",1569600,1572160,"Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?","The Mummy"
"201",1577280,1578880,"Well...","The Mummy"

"210",1609200,1612760,"Well, I don't know.Just something about you.","The Mummy"
"211",1614040,1616400,"I'd have liked Egypt betterif I'd met you there.","The Mummy"
"212",1616520,1620640,"No such luck! Stuck in the desertfor two months, and was it hot!","The Mummy"
"213",1620760,1622800,"- That tomb.- What tomb?","The Mummy"
"214",1624200,1626640,"Surely you read about the princess?","The Mummy"

"216",1628720,1631560,"The 14 steps downand the unbroken seals were thrilling.","The Mummy"

"221",1645160,1649160,"Well, after we'd worked among her things,I felt as if I'd known her.","The Mummy"
"222",1649960,1653680,"But when we got the wrappings off,and I saw her face...","The Mummy"
"223",1653720,1657120,"You'll think me silly,but I sort of fell in love with her.","The Mummy"
"224",1658320,1661800,"Do you have to open gravesto find giris to fall in love with?","The Mummy"
"225",1664280,1668520,"I say. Now I know what it is about you.","The Mummy"
"226",1670560,1673280,"There was something about her head...","The Mummy"
"227",1673560,1676600,"I had never mentioned the name,yet I heard Miss Grosvenor","The Mummy"
"228",1676720,1679920,"mutter in ancient Egyptiansomething about Imhotep.","The Mummy"
"229",1680000,1682040,"Imhotep?","The Mummy"
"230",1685920,1688360,"What was this Ardathdoing in the museum?","The Mummy"
"231",1689440,1692360,"Looking at the mummy.Just at closing time.","The Mummy"
"232",1695880,1697440,"Hello?","The Mummy"

"236",1707320,1710920,"Come. A museum guard found deadin the room with the princess.","The Mummy"
"237",1722640,1724880,"Fear. Fear.","The Mummy"

"239",1727200,1729680,"We find this in dead guard's hand,Sir Joseph.","The Mummy"
"240",1729800,1733920,"Probably thief tried to steal it.Guard take it away, thief kill him.","The Mummy"
"241",1735000,1737800,"The cause of death, I not find nothing.","The Mummy"
"242",1738680,1742160,"Looks like an attempted theft, butnothing stolen here could be sold.","The Mummy"
"243",1742240,1744200,"What is the document?","The Mummy"
"244",1765760,1768240,"Let me put this here.You'll be more comfortable.","The Mummy"
"245",1768360,1770680,"Thanks.","The Mummy"
"246",1770800,1774640,"You really want to know whyI didn't take you to the hospital?","The Mummy"
"247",1774680,1778800,"- Because, when I held you in my arms...- Hadn't you better not commit yourself?","The Mummy"
"248",1778920,1782840,"What girl could not make a conquest whocollapsed at a man's feet in moonlight?","The Mummy"
"249",1782880,1787680,"It seems absurd when we've known eachother such a short time, but I'm serious.","The Mummy"
"250",1787720,1790040,"Haven't I had enoughexcitement for one evening,","The Mummy"
"251",1790120,1793440,"without the additional thrillof a strange man making love to me?","The Mummy"
"252",1793480,1796720,"But I've never been seriousabout this sort of thing before.","The Mummy"
"253",1796760,1801640,"Now, look here. You can tell me to goto the devil, but you can't laugh at me.","The Mummy"
"254",1807480,1812240,"The curse has struck her, and now,through her, it will strike my son.","The Mummy"
"255",1812360,1814040,"Quiet.","The Mummy"

"258",1824160,1826200,"I'll be back in a minute.","The Mummy"
"259",1836680,1839560,"Imhotep was alivewhen that mummy in the museum","The Mummy"
"260",1839680,1841440,"was a vestal virgin in the temple.","The Mummy"
"261",1841560,1844720,"3700 years ago!What's that got to do with us now?","The Mummy"
"262",1844760,1847040,"Your assistant who went insane and died,","The Mummy"
"263",1847080,1849280,"as you might haveif you'd seen what he saw,","The Mummy"
"264",1849400,1852160,"made a transcription of part of that scroll.","The Mummy"
"265",1852280,1855000,"Yes. I have it still.","The Mummy"
"266",1855040,1859600,"You seem to think it has all the devils ofhell in it. Burn it and be done with it.","The Mummy"
"267",1859680,1861720,"An excellent suggestion.","The Mummy"
"268",1862320,1864520,"What became of the mummy of Imhotep?","The Mummy"
"269",1866040,1868080,"Somebody stole it!","The Mummy"
"270",1869160,1871600,"Look, what's the matterwith Miss Grosvenor?","The Mummy"
"271",1871640,1874920,"You still think thatthat mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?","The Mummy"
"272",1876040,1880560,"Yes. I...I really don't know.","The Mummy"
"273",1956680,1959840,"A thousand pardons. I am Ardath Bey.","The Mummy"

"276",1970240,1973960,"- He's in the study.- In conference?","The Mummy"
"277",1974000,1976000,"If I might perhaps wait?","The Mummy"
"278",1977360,1979840,"Yes. Of course.","The Mummy"
"279",1985880,1989000,"Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?","The Mummy"
"280",1989040,1992360,"No. I don't think so.","The Mummy"
"281",1993880,1997640,"I don't think one would forgetmeeting you, Ardath Bey.","The Mummy"
"282",1997680,1999720,"Then I am mistaken.","The Mummy"
"283",2001120,2003160,"But you are of our blood.","The Mummy"
"284",2003280,2005240,"As to that, I am not mistaken.","The Mummy"
"285",2006360,2010680,"Yes. My mother was Egyptian.","The Mummy"
"286",2010880,2013320,"You must burn the Scroll of Thoth!","The Mummy"
"287",2013360,2016920,"I tell you,it's the museum's property, not mine.","The Mummy"
"288",2017040,2019200,"Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?","The Mummy"
"289",2023840,2026200,"Ardath Bey!","The Mummy"
"290",2026240,2028280,"He's come for the scroll.","The Mummy"
"291",2049920,2052320,"Ardath Bey, Dr Muller.","The Mummy"
"292",2054320,2059680,"I accept your invitation. But I findno solitary student with his books.","The Mummy"
"293",2059800,2061760,"I fear my visit is inopportune.","The Mummy"
"294",2061880,2064880,"On the contrary.We were just talking about...","The Mummy"
"295",2065000,2067040,"- Me?- Your native Egypt.","The Mummy"
"296",2068040,2070520,"You know Miss Grosvenor?","The Mummy"
"297",2070640,2073160,"Ardath Bey introduced himself.","The Mummy"
"298",2075000,2076960,"Won't you be seated?","The Mummy"
"299",2090840,2093000,"Sir Joseph was justwondering how you knew","The Mummy"
"300",2093040,2096040,"where the tomb of the princessAnck-es-en-Amon was hidden.","The Mummy"
"301",2096120,2099160,"Partly inference, partly chance.","The Mummy"
"302",2101120,2103560,"Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.","The Mummy"
"303",2104960,2108680,"Yes. A tragedy at the museumafter you left.","The Mummy"
"304",2109880,2112240,"Tragedy?","The Mummy"
"305",2112360,2114360,"When I was there...","The Mummy"
"306",2115080,2117320,"When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?","The Mummy"
"307",2119080,2122920,"Yes. They told me I went thereand tried to get in after it was closed.","The Mummy"
"308",2123040,2125200,"I don't remember, but...","The Mummy"
"309",2125240,2127280,"Helen, it is very late.","The Mummy"
"310",2127960,2130560,"Frank, will you pleasesee Helen back to the hotel?","The Mummy"
"311",2130600,2134320,"- Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.- I don't want to go.","The Mummy"
"312",2134960,2138000,"After what happened, you need rest badly.","The Mummy"
"313",2138040,2143760,"But I don't. I was tired, but...","The Mummy"
"314",2143800,2145800,"Why, I've never felt so alive before!","The Mummy"
"315",2145840,2148720,"- As your doctor, I must order you to go.- I'm not a child.","The Mummy"
"316",2148840,2150800,"Yes, please come.","The Mummy"
"317",2153520,2155840,"Then, Ardath Bey, au revoir.","The Mummy"
"318",2155920,2157880,"We must see each other again.","The Mummy"
"319",2159360,2161320,"I shall be honoured.","The Mummy"
"320",2179560,2184640,"An unusual crime. A guard killedby a man who left a gift to the museum.","The Mummy"
"321",2184760,2186720,"- A gift?- A scroll.","The Mummy"
"322",2187400,2190520,"Part of which was transcribedwhen it was first found.","The Mummy"
"323",2190560,2192600,"Here is the transcription.","The Mummy"
"324",2196000,2199040,"I cannot read the writingof a period so remote.","The Mummy"
"325",2199080,2202040,"But you read ""Anck-es-en-Amon""on that piece of pottery.","The Mummy"
"326",2202080,2204120,"That was of the 18th dynasty.","The Mummy"
"327",2204160,2206720,"These are pre-dynastic ideographs.","The Mummy"
"328",2206760,2210040,"The scroll from which thiswas copied was stolen ten years ago,","The Mummy"
"329",2210160,2213160,"together with the mummyof the high priest Imhotep.","The Mummy"
"330",2213200,2215360,"Most interesting.","The Mummy"
"331",2215480,2218400,"May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?","The Mummy"
"332",2218880,2221840,"We left it at the... museum.","The Mummy"
"333",2222080,2225000,"- So.- I have something else to show you.","The Mummy"
"334",2225920,2227880,"A photograph.","The Mummy"
"335",2231840,2233880,"Why do you show all this to me?","The Mummy"
"336",2235000,2237960,"Do you think it conceivablethat the mummy was not stolen,","The Mummy"
"337",2238000,2241000,"but given a semblanceof life by the spell of the scroll?","The Mummy"
"338",2241040,2244040,"That scroll is my property.I bought it from a dealer.","The Mummy"
"339",2244120,2248000,"It is here in this house.I presume, in that room.","The Mummy"
"340",2253240,2255440,"We had foreseen this.","The Mummy"
"341",2255560,2257600,"The scroll is in safe hands.","The Mummy"
"342",2257640,2262360,"It will be destroyed the minuteit is known that harm has come to us.","The Mummy"
"343",2262400,2266640,"You have studied our ancient arts,and you know that you cannot harm me.","The Mummy"
"344",2266680,2270120,"You also know that you mustreturn that scroll to me or die.","The Mummy"
"345",2271600,2275200,"Now tell that weak foolto get that scroll, wherever it is,","The Mummy"
"346",2275320,2278440,"and hand it to his Nubian servant.","The Mummy"
"347",2279120,2282000,"- The Nubian!- The ancient blood.","The Mummy"
"348",2284080,2286240,"So you have made him your slave.","The Mummy"
"349",2287880,2294800,"If I could get my hands on you,I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.","The Mummy"
"350",2297520,2299560,"But your power is too strong.","The Mummy"
"351",2314800,2317960,"This is the evil forcethat has been attacking her.","The Mummy"
"352",2318000,2320840,"Burn the scroll, man. Burn it!","The Mummy"
"353",2320880,2324000,"It was through youthis horror came into existence.","The Mummy"
"354",2324120,2327520,"It's true. It's true.","The Mummy"
"355",2444840,2449480,"Your father destroyed the scroll,knowing that it would cost him his life.","The Mummy"
"356",2452560,2454720,"What's that?","The Mummy"
"357",2454800,2460480,"Isis. The Egyptian symbol of life.I meant it for your father.","The Mummy"
"358",2460560,2463120,"What good couldthat old charm have done him?","The Mummy"
"359",2465040,2467880,"I tell you, the doctors sayit's plainly heart failure.","The Mummy"
"360",2467920,2469840,"The Nubian is missing.","The Mummy"
"361",2469920,2472800,"He's an old servant. He's frightened.","The Mummy"
"362",2472840,2474880,"He'll be back.","The Mummy"
"363",2475720,2479560,"Don't try and make me believe that thisArdath fellow is a mummy come to life.","The Mummy"
"364",2479680,2482160,"That idea, and the horror of it,killed my father.","The Mummy"
"365",2482240,2485720,"The museum guarddied of natural causes, too.","The Mummy"
"366",2485840,2488000,"Frank, I need your help.","The Mummy"
"367",2488040,2491760,"I saw your attractionto my patient last night, and hers to you.","The Mummy"
"368",2493080,2496440,"- Hers to me? Do you really think so?- And I welcomed it.","The Mummy"
"369",2496560,2500360,"But do you think I have a chance?Cos I think she's the most won...","The Mummy"
"370",2502280,2505880,"- Oh, but this is terrible at a time like this...- Frank, I'm afraid.","The Mummy"
"371",2506000,2510560,"- Will you go with me to her now?- Yes.","The Mummy"
"372",2510680,2514200,"Then telephone her first,not to leave the hotel.","The Mummy"
"373",2526400,2528360,"9590.","The Mummy"
"374",2530240,2532200,"No. I'm not going out.","The Mummy"
"375",2534000,2537280,"Yes. I promise to wait until you get here.","The Mummy"
"376",2538680,2542360,"Goodbye. And I'm so dreadfully sorry.","The Mummy"
"377",2568720,2570880,"What were you doing, Doctor?","The Mummy"
"378",2571000,2573640,"Your father did not burnthe Scroll of Thoth.","The Mummy"
"379",2573760,2576080,"That creature has it now.","The Mummy"
"380",2576200,2578960,"- The ashes in the fireplace!- They were newspaper.","The Mummy"
"381",2579000,2581000,"The scroll is papyrus.","The Mummy"
"382",2581040,2583640,"Then it was murder? The Nubian!","The Mummy"
"383",2586680,2588680,"Wear this around your neck.","The Mummy"
"384",2590920,2593520,"- Why?- When we fight this creature,","The Mummy"
"385",2593640,2597200,"we must ask protectionfrom the forces of all that it defied.","The Mummy"
"386",2597240,2601080,"- I'll give it to Helen. She needs protection.- No, her life is not in danger.","The Mummy"
"387",2601200,2602960,"It is her soul.","The Mummy"
"388",2603000,2607080,"Should love for you come to her,he will try to destroy you.","The Mummy"
"389",2607200,2611760,"That amulet, the Egyptians believed,was a charm against evil sendings,","The Mummy"
"390",2611800,2614000,"such as struck down your father.","The Mummy"
"391",2677640,2679960,"Your dog is frightened.","The Mummy"
"392",2680080,2682280,"My servant will see to him.","The Mummy"
"393",2687080,2689080,"Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.","The Mummy"
"394",2695720,2698080,"Ancient Egypt.","The Mummy"
"395",2698160,2700200,"Nothing modern.","The Mummy"
"396",2708720,2710920,"What a strange incense.","The Mummy"
"397",2710960,2713000,"Is it not familiar to you?","The Mummy"
"398",2714200,2716920,"- No.- Our forefathers used it.","The Mummy"
"399",2717760,2720240,"Yours and mine.","The Mummy"
"400",2724360,2727280,"You will not rememberwhat I show you now,","The Mummy"
"401",2727560,2734800,"and yet I shall awaken memoriesof love and crime and death.","The Mummy"
"402",2765800,2768120,"I knelt by the bed of death.","The Mummy"
"403",2800400,2803640,"Thy father's last farewell.","The Mummy"
"404",2868560,2871800,"I knew the Scroll of Thothcould bring thee back to life.","The Mummy"
"405",2890080,2894160,"I dared the god's anger, and stole it.","The Mummy"
"406",2898560,2902360,"I stole back to thy tombto bring thee back to life.","The Mummy"
"407",2903400,2906280,"I murmured the spell that raises the dead.","The Mummy"
"408",2907480,2912440,"They broke in upon meand found me doing an unholy thing.","The Mummy"
"409",2927760,2930760,"Thy father condemned meto the nameless death.","The Mummy"
"410",2930800,2932720,"The scroll he ordered buried with me,","The Mummy"
"411",2932760,2936120,"that no such sacrilegemight disgrace Egypt again.","The Mummy"
"412",3057800,3062200,"A nameless grave. The slaves were killedso that none should know.","The Mummy"
"413",3063160,3066360,"The soldiers who killed themwere also slain,","The Mummy"
"414",3066440,3068360,"so no friend could creep to the desert","The Mummy"
"415",3068480,3071800,"with funeral offeringsfor my condemned spirit.","The Mummy"
"416",3080600,3082600,"Anck-es-en-Amon.","The Mummy"
"417",3084680,3088000,"My love has lasted longerthan the temples of our gods.","The Mummy"
"418",3089120,3091560,"No man ever suffered as I did for you.","The Mummy"
"419",3092360,3094800,"The rest you may not know.","The Mummy"
"420",3094840,3099960,"Not until you are about to pass throughthe great night of terror and triumph,","The Mummy"
"421",3100080,3104280,"until you are ready to face momentsof horror for an eternity of love,","The Mummy"
"422",3105840,3108440,"until I send backyour spirit, that has wandered","The Mummy"
"423",3108560,3111440,"through so many formsand so many ages.","The Mummy"
"424",3113640,3117880,"But, before then,Bast must again send forth death.","The Mummy"
"425",3118160,3121480,"Death to that boy for whomlove is creeping into your heart.","The Mummy"
"426",3121840,3124200,"Love that would keep you from myself.","The Mummy"
"427",3124920,3128720,"Love that might bringsickness and even death to you.","The Mummy"
"428",3131760,3133800,"Awake.","The Mummy"
"429",3138720,3140680,"Have I been asleep?","The Mummy"
"430",3141920,3144240,"I had strange dreams.","The Mummy"
"431",3145280,3148760,"Dreams of ancient Egypt, I think.There was someone like you in them.","The Mummy"
"432",3148840,3151200,"My pool is sometimes troubled.","The Mummy"
"433",3151240,3155640,"One sees strange fantasies in the water.But they pass like dreams.","The Mummy"

"522",3476920,3479800,"- And then?- We will destroy him.","The Mummy"
"523",3504560,3508080,"I've given her some bromide.She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.","The Mummy"

"527",3628360,3632440,"This is my bed, but this is not the temple,nor my father's palace.","The Mummy"
"528",3632520,3635000,"Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.","The Mummy"
"529",3635080,3637080,"Do not be afraid.","The Mummy"
"530",3637680,3644560,"I was afraid. When you knelt beside mybed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.","The Mummy"
"531",3644640,3647880,"Your last memory is of mein the hour of your death","The Mummy"

"542",3703280,3705720,"What mummy has usurpedmy eternal resting place?","The Mummy"
"543",3705800,3709800,"It is thy dead shell.I tried then to raise this body.","The Mummy"
"544",3709880,3714440,"I could raise it now, but it would bea mere thing that moved at my will,","The Mummy"
"545",3714520,3716520,"without a soul.","The Mummy"
"546",3752360,3755720,"It was not only this bodythat I loved, it was thy soul.","The Mummy"

"550",3783560,3785560,"Come.","The Mummy"
"551",3808040,3811360,"Imhotep, this is the place of embalming.","The Mummy"

"553",3818000,3821200,"Come to the altar of Anubis,the guide of the dead.","The Mummy"
"554",3831960,3834320,"The time has come for the final prayer.","The Mummy"
"555",3835000,3837000,"What have I to do with Anubis?","The Mummy"
"556",3841560,3844600,"The ancient ritesmust be performed over thy body.","The Mummy"

"127",814313,815481,"Oh, man.","Se7en"
"128",815649,817817,"How does someonelet themselves go like that?","Se7en"
"129",818360,821571,"It took four orderliesjust to get him on the table.","Se7en"
"130",824407,826784,"How'd the fat fuckever fit out his front door?","Se7en"
"131",826951,828953,"Please.It's obvious he was a shut-in.","Se7en"
"132",829120,830538,"Now, look at this.","Se7en"
"133",830705,832249,"See how big this stomach is?","Se7en"
"134",832414,835251,"And the strange thing is,it stretches.","Se7en"
"135",835418,838629,"Here. Look at the size of thecardiac orifice, where the food--","Se7en"
"136",838797,841883,"Wait, I see what you're pointing out,but that means nothing to me.","Se7en"
"137",842049,845511,"Okay. He's got lines of distentionacross the duodenum.","Se7en"
"138",845928,848597,"And the interiorwall is ripped open.","Se7en"
"139",849099,851268,"This man ate till he burst?","Se7en"
"140",851433,853937,"He didn't really burst.Not all the way.","Se7en"
"141",854104,856565,"He was hemorrhaging internally.","Se7en"
"142",856730,860943,"And there was a hematoma in the rectusand transverse abdominis muscles.","Se7en"
"143",861110,862445,"So he did die by eating.","Se7en"
"144",862611,864154,"Yes and no.","Se7en"
"145",866157,867868,"What about these bruises up here?","Se7en"
"146",869786,871538,"Well, I haven'tfigured that out yet.","Se7en"
"147",871913,873581,"Gun pressed against his head?","Se7en"
"148",873748,875082,"Pressed hard enough, sure.","Se7en"
"149",875250,876710,"Fuck,yeah.","Se7en"
"150",876876,879796,"Marks from the front side,flush with the muzzle.","Se7en"

"152",888053,890807,"Killer put a bucketbeneath him, kept on serving.","Se7en"
"153",890974,892350,"Took his time, too.","Se7en"
"154",892517,895269,"Coroner said this could've gone onmore than 12 hours.","Se7en"
"155",895729,898731,"Victim's throat was swollen,probably from the effort.","Se7en"
"156",898899,901775,"And there was definitely a pointwhen he passed out.","Se7en"
"157",901942,904486,"That's when the killer kicked himand he burst.","Se7en"
"158",904653,906615,"Oof.Sadistic fucker, huh?","Se7en"
"159",906780,909200,"When you want somebodydead, you drive by and shoot.","Se7en"
"160",909366,912412,"You don't risk the timeit takes to do this.","Se7en"
"161",912578,915373,"Unless the act itself has meaning.Come on.","Se7en"
"162",915749,919336,"Somebody had a problem with the fatboy and decided to torture him.","Se7en"
"163",919501,920503,"Simple as that.","Se7en"
"164",920669,922672,"In the grocery bags,we found two receipts.","Se7en"
"165",922838,925174,"That means the killer stoppedin the middle...","Se7en"
"166",925341,927469,"...and made a second tripto the supermarket.","Se7en"
"167",927635,929011,"So?","Se7en"
"168",930096,933350,"Hey, man, it's his thing.I've been out in the rain all day.","Se7en"
"169",933515,934893,"This is beginning.","Se7en"
"170",935059,937354,"We've got one dead guy,not three.","Se7en"
"171",937770,939563,"No motive.","Se7en"
"172",939898,943525,"Don't even start that big brain ofyours cooking on this, all right?","Se7en"
"173",943692,946528,"Please, I'd like to be reassigned.","Se7en"
"174",946696,947739,"What?What?","Se7en"
"175",947905,950866,"What, whoa?What in the hell are you talking about?","Se7en"
"176",951326,953411,"This can't be my last duty.","Se7en"
"177",953577,955538,"It's just gonna go onand on and on.","Se7en"
"178",955705,956748,"You're retiring.","Se7en"
"179",956914,959084,"Six more daysand you're all the way gone.","Se7en"
"180",959250,961461,"Won't be the first timeyou've left unfinished--","Se7en"
"181",961628,965173,"Those other oases were taken as closeto conclusion as humanly possible.","Se7en"
"182",965340,966716,"And if I may speak freely?","Se7en"
"183",966883,968217,"We're all friends here.","Se7en"

"187",975600,978394,"Hey, man, I'm right here.You can say that shit to my face.","Se7en"
"188",978561,980230,"Captain--It's too soon for you.","Se7en"
"189",981563,983732,"Captain,if we can just talk in private?","Se7en"
"190",983899,985943,"This isn't working.It's a personal thing.","Se7en"
"191",986110,987653,"Maybe--Just shut up, Mills.","Se7en"
"192",987821,991740,"Look, I don't have anyone elseto put on this and you know it.","Se7en"
"193",991908,994702,"This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.","Se7en"
"194",994869,996495,"Give it to me.","Se7en"
"195",996663,998956,"Say what?Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.","Se7en"

"1263",6124368,6125453,"What do you mean?","Se7en"
"1264",6125619,6129373,"At this stage, what harm can it doto tell us a bit about yourself?","Se7en"
"1265",6129873,6133043,"It doesn't matter who I am.Who I am means absolutely nothing.","Se7en"
"1266",6133211,6135130,"You need to stay onyour left up here.","Se7en"
"1267",6139384,6141094,"So where are we heading?","Se7en"
"1268",6141761,6142804,"You'll see.","Se7en"
"1269",6143555,6147057,"We're not just going to pick uptwo more dead bodies, are we, John?","Se7en"
"1270",6147559,6149435,"That wouldn't be shocking enough.","Se7en"
"1271",6149601,6152729,"We've got newspapersto think about, yeah?","Se7en"
"1272",6153814,6156024,"Wanting people to listen...","Se7en"
"1273",6156192,6159737,"...you can't just tap themon the shoulder anymore.","Se7en"
"1274",6159904,6162282,"You have to hit themwith a sledgehammer.","Se7en"
"1275",6162448,6165409,"And then you'll noticeyou've got their strict attention.","Se7en"
"1276",6165577,6167453,"But the question is:","Se7en"
"1277",6167619,6170289,"What makes you so specialthat people should listen?","Se7en"
"1278",6170832,6171957,"I'm not special.","Se7en"
"1279",6173083,6175587,"I've never been exceptional.","Se7en"
"1280",6175920,6179591,"This is, though, what I'm doing.My work.","Se7en"

"1284",6187599,6188640,"That's not true.","Se7en"
"1285",6188807,6189893,"No, it is true.","Se7en"
"1286",6190059,6193229,"And the funny thing is,all this work...","Se7en"
"1287",6193395,6195398,"...two months from now,no one's gonna care.","Se7en"
"1288",6195564,6197900,"No one's gonna give a shit,no one's gonna remember.","Se7en"
"1289",6198067,6201112,"You can't see the wholecomplete act yet.","Se7en"
"1290",6201863,6203448,"But when this is done...","Se7en"
"1291",6204782,6206117,"...when it's finished...","Se7en"
"1292",6207952,6209453,"...it's going to be...","Se7en"
"1293",6212457,6215792,"People will barely be ableto comprehend.","Se7en"
"1294",6215960,6218003,"But they won't be able to deny.","Se7en"
"1295",6219631,6221090,"Could the freak be more vague?","Se7en"
"1296",6222257,6224510,"I mean, as far as masterplans go, John--","Se7en"
"1297",6224676,6228514,"I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.It's really going to be something.","Se7en"

"1299",6232476,6235729,"So when this big thing happens,you be sure and let me know.","Se7en"
"1300",6235896,6239399,"Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.Oh, don't worry.","Se7en"
"1301",6239567,6240609,"You won't.","Se7en"
"1302",6242612,6244738,"You won't miss a thing.","Se7en"

"1359",6460121,6461997,"But that's the point.","Se7en"
"1360",6463166,6466210,"We see a deadly sinon every street corner...","Se7en"
"1361",6466377,6469255,"...in every home and we tolerate it.","Se7en"
"1362",6469921,6472675,"We tolerate itbecause it's common, it's...","Se7en"
"1363",6472841,6474510,"It's trivial.","Se7en"
"1364",6474676,6477637,"We tolerate it morning,noon and night.","Se7en"
"1365",6480725,6482894,"Well, not anymore.","Se7en"
"1366",6484895,6487273,"I'm setting the example.","Se7en"

"125",1204960,1207611,"Talking about what, exactly?","Spectre"
"126",1208599,1211410,"That what you did in Mexicowas one step too far.","Spectre"

"131",1221640,1222971,"All right.","Spectre"
"132",1224240,1226367,"I think you've got a secret.","Spectre"
"133",1227160,1229970,"And it's somethingyou won't tell anyone.","Spectre"
"134",1230839,1232842,"Because you don't trust anyone.","Spectre"
"135",1243640,1247644,"If anything happens to me, 007,I need you to do something.","Spectre"
"136",1247960,1251442,"Find a man called Marco Sciarra.","Spectre"

"141",1263599,1266079,"In my mailboxjust after she died.","Spectre"
"142",1266799,1268961,"Well, she was nevershort of surprises.","Spectre"
"143",1270319,1272560,"She wasn't gonna let deathget in the way of her job.","Spectre"
"144",1274519,1276965,"I've been trackingSciarra ever since.","Spectre"
"145",1277039,1278371,"And what have you found?","Spectre"
"146",1278880,1280803,"Nothing significant yet.","Spectre"
"147",1281240,1282287,"When's the funeral?","Spectre"
"148",1283200,1285567,"Three days. In Rome.","Spectre"
"149",1285680,1288683,"If you think M's signing off on that,you're insane.","Spectre"
"150",1288920,1290250,"He won't let youout of his sight.","Spectre"
"151",1290319,1292560,"Yes, it's a bit of a problem.","Spectre"
"152",1292759,1293965,"Listen.","Spectre"
"153",1294400,1297324,"Could you do a littlequiet digging for me?","Spectre"
"154",1297759,1300411,"I heard a name in Mexico.""The Pale King.""","Spectre"
"155",1302799,1304689,"You want me to be your mole.","Spectre"
"156",1306440,1307487,"Yes.","Spectre"
"157",1309599,1312604,"And what makes you thinkyou can trust me?","Spectre"
"158",1315240,1316570,"Instinct.","Spectre"
"159",1377119,1380282,"Poor old girl.Rigged for demolition in a week.","Spectre"
"160",1381720,1384564,"Cheaper to knock her downthan to rebuild.","Spectre"
"161",1384960,1386325,"Still.","Spectre"
"162",1386400,1388880,"Time waits for no manand all that.","Spectre"
"163",1389720,1392644,"Anyway, all the money'sbeen spent on this,","Spectre"
"164",1393559,1396244,"the New Centre forNational Security.","Spectre"
"165",1398079,1400082,"So that's C's new digs.","Spectre"
"166",1400400,1401924,"You've met him, have you?","Spectre"
"167",1402000,1404127,"Yesterday.What do we know about him?","Spectre"
"168",1404200,1406362,"Classic Whitehall mandarin.","Spectre"
"169",1406440,1407566,"Wrote a dossier last year","Spectre"
"170",1407640,1409642,"on how the double-0 programwas obsolete,","Spectre"
"171",1409759,1412763,"how drones could doall our dirty work abroad.","Spectre"
"172",1413079,1414605,"Went to school withthe Home Secretary.","Spectre"
"173",1414680,1416170,"Of course, he did.","Spectre"
"174",1416240,1418527,"This merger'sjust the start of it.","Spectre"
"175",1418599,1420921,"In three days, there'sa security conference in Tokyo","Spectre"
"176",1421000,1423240,"to decide the New World Order.","Spectre"
"177",1423319,1425560,"If C gets his way,he'll have unlimited access","Spectre"
"178",1425640,1428371,"to the combined intelligence streamsof nine countries.","Spectre"
"179",1428440,1429645,"Including us.","Spectre"
"180",1429720,1430881,"Quite.","Spectre"
"181",1440200,1442520,"Well, a lot's happenedwhile you were away.","Spectre"
"182",1442599,1446684,"A train bombing in Hamburgand an industrial explosion in Tunisia.","Spectre"
"183",1446880,1448211,"It's not great timing for us.","Spectre"
"184",1448599,1451125,"It's all ratherplaying into C's hands.","Spectre"
"185",1451200,1455125,"M, well, let's sayhe's feeling the pressure.","Spectre"
"186",1455559,1456891,"Yeah, I've noticed.","Spectre"
"187",1456960,1458769,"Now, this way, 007.","Spectre"
"188",1458839,1461319,"Be careful.It's a trifle slippery.","Spectre"
"189",1464200,1466520,"Q wasn't exactly feeling at homein Whitehall,","Spectre"
"190",1466599,1467601,"what with the new merger,","Spectre"
"191",1467680,1471809,"so he set up shop here,away from prying eyes, as it were.","Spectre"
"192",1471880,1474723,"I hear he's got something ratherspecial planned for you.","Spectre"
"193",1474799,1476483,"I can hardly wait.","Spectre"
"194",1487200,1488361,"Ah, 007.","Spectre"
"195",1489839,1491922,"- Q.- Please excuse the mess.","Spectre"
"196",1492279,1493486,"Everything's a littlebit up in the air,","Spectre"
"197",1493559,1494846,"what with the changes and all.","Spectre"
"198",1494920,1497240,"Couple of things to get through.","Spectre"
"199",1498200,1499929,"Shall we get started?","Spectre"
"200",1500559,1501891,"Just relax.","Spectre"
"201",1503720,1504721,"That's it. Lovely.","Spectre"
"202",1505000,1506843,"Now, you may feel a small...","Spectre"

"216",1541160,1542286,"Good.","Spectre"
"217",1544119,1547249,"Right. Well, I've just, um,got one last thing for you","Spectre"
"218",1547319,1548890,"and you can be on your way.","Spectre"
"219",1555799,1557722,"Magnificent, isn't she?","Spectre"
"220",1558160,1560401,"Zero to 60 inthree point two seconds.","Spectre"
"221",1560480,1563847,"Fully bulletproof.A few little tricks up her sleeve.","Spectre"
"222",1564839,1566604,"It's a shame, really.She was meant for you,","Spectre"
"223",1566680,1569604,"but she's beenreassigned to 009.","Spectre"
"224",1570920,1572808,"But you can have this.","Spectre"
"225",1578319,1579923,"Does it do anything?","Spectre"
"226",1580000,1581683,"It tells the time.","Spectre"
"227",1582240,1584083,"Might help with yourpunctuality issues.","Spectre"

"233",1604880,1607359,"Mind you, there wasn'tmuch left to work on.","Spectre"
"234",1607440,1609328,"Only a steering wheel.","Spectre"
"235",1609400,1613689,"I believe I said, ""Bring it back in one piece,""not, ""Bring back one piece.""","Spectre"

"892",6141000,6142239,"Think about it.","Spectre"
"893",6142880,6146520,"So many years up there,alone, silent,","Spectre"
"894",6147680,6151604,"building momentum until it choseto make its mark on Earth.","Spectre"

"909",6223319,6225048,"Information is all,","Spectre"
"910",6226359,6227690,"is it not?","Spectre"
"911",6228920,6230364,"For example,","Spectre"
"912",6230439,6235047,"you must know by now thatthe double-0 program is officially dead.","Spectre"
"913",6235239,6239484,"Which leads me tospeculate exactly why you came.","Spectre"
"914",6242760,6245649,"So, James, why did you come?","Spectre"
"915",6246159,6247844,"I came here to kill you.","Spectre"
"916",6248840,6251161,"And I thought youcame here to die.","Spectre"
"917",6251479,6253528,"Well, it's alla matter of perspective.","Spectre"
"918",6255159,6257048,"Speaking of perspective.","Spectre"
"919",6274840,6278207,"- Is this live?- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.","Spectre"
"920",6279479,6281720,"What an uncanny coincidence.","Spectre"

"933",6323079,6324490,"Oh, I think I do.","Spectre"
"934",6324560,6327324,"You set cities on fire and watchinnocent people burn,","Spectre"

"936",6329680,6332331,"an intelligence networkyou've paid for.","Spectre"
"937",6332399,6334243,"Not that complicated.","Spectre"
"938",6334960,6338760,"I'm guessing our little friend, C,he's one of your disciples.","Spectre"
"939",6340199,6341929,"You could say that.","Spectre"
"940",6342119,6343724,"And what does he get out of it?","Spectre"
"941",6344720,6345926,"Nothing.","Spectre"
"942",6346560,6348368,"He's a visionary, like me.","Spectre"
"943",6348439,6350090,"Visionaries.","Spectre"
"944",6350880,6352769,"Psychiatric wardsare full of them.","Spectre"
"945",6352880,6355804,"Whereas you couldn't seewhat's right in front of you.","Spectre"
"946",6355880,6359885,"You came across me so many timesand yet you never saw me.","Spectre"
"947",6360439,6362841,"Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.","Spectre"
"948",6362960,6364086,"All dead.","Spectre"
"949",6364159,6365286,"Yeah, that's right.","Spectre"
"950",6365560,6367050,"A nice pattern developed.","Spectre"
"951",6367119,6370567,"You interfered in my world,I destroyed yours.","Spectre"
"952",6372439,6374043,"Or did you thinkit was coincidence","Spectre"
"953",6374119,6376690,"that all the women inyour life ended up dead?","Spectre"
"954",6378119,6380202,"Vesper Lynd, for example.","Spectre"
"955",6381680,6385082,"She was the big one.Has he told you about her?","Spectre"
"956",6387439,6390603,"And then, of course,your beloved M.","Spectre"
"957",6391479,6393481,"Gone forever.","Spectre"
"958",6397600,6398761,"Me.","Spectre"
"959",6400640,6402721,"It was all me, James.","Spectre"
"960",6402800,6406600,"It's always been me.The author of all your pain.","Spectre"
"961",6410439,6412841,"You're a brave woman, my dear.","Spectre"
"962",6420159,6423323,"Now I understand whymy father lost his mind.","Spectre"
"963",6423680,6426569,"He didn't lose his mind,he was just weak.","Spectre"
"964",6426640,6428641,"But at least he understoodwhat he was up against.","Spectre"
"965",6429000,6432208,"You see, they failedto comprehend the crucial fact,","Spectre"
"966",6432319,6436006,"that a terrible eventcan lead to something wonderful.","Spectre"
"967",6438359,6440362,"Since you mention your father,I'll show you.","Spectre"
"968",6441359,6443886,"She's clever. She's smarter than me.","Spectre"
"969",6443960,6445199,"She knows how to hide.","Spectre"
"970",6447520,6450444,"I can protect herif you tell me where he is.","Spectre"
"971",6452840,6454489,"I can keep her alive.","Spectre"
"972",6454560,6455800,"Yeah.","Spectre"
"973",6455880,6457086,"You have my word.","Spectre"
"974",6457159,6459127,"No, no, no. Turn this off.","Spectre"
"975",6459199,6460804,"Your word?","Spectre"
"976",6461359,6462805,"The word of an assassin!","Spectre"
"977",6462880,6464211,"Turn this off.","Spectre"
"978",6464359,6466362,"This is important.I said turn it off!","Spectre"
"979",6469000,6471525,"I want you tounderstand something.","Spectre"
"980",6481399,6483083,"That's my word.","Spectre"
"981",6484359,6485485,"Madeleine?","Spectre"
"982",6486000,6487411,"Look at me.","Spectre"
"983",6488560,6492006,"Don't look at him,Madeleine. Look at me.","Spectre"
"984",6493880,6495369,"L'Américain.","Spectre"
"985",6496560,6498130,"You save her,","Spectre"
"986",6498479,6501563,"she can lead you to L'Américain.She knows L'Américain.","Spectre"
"987",6504359,6506408,"Try the Hoffler Klinik.","Spectre"
"988",6512920,6517288,"You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,Mr. Bond.","Spectre"
"989",6520439,6521770,"So long.","Spectre"
"990",6528920,6532287,"The things thatbring people together.","Spectre"
"991",6536239,6538890,"Out of horror, beauty.","Spectre"
"992",6565439,6568250,"Torture is easy,on a superficial level.","Spectre"
"993",6568319,6571448,"A man can watch himselfbeing disemboweled","Spectre"
"994",6571960,6575122,"and derive great horrorfrom the experience,","Spectre"
"995",6575199,6577850,"but it's stillgoing on at a distance.","Spectre"
"996",6578000,6580765,"It isn't takingplace where he is.","Spectre"
"997",6581479,6587168,"As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,a man lives inside his head.","Spectre"
"998",6587640,6590404,"That's wherethe seat of his soul is.","Spectre"
"999",6591760,6594206,"Now, James and I wereboth present recently","Spectre"
"1000",6594279,6596805,"when a man wasdeprived of his eyes.","Spectre"
"1001",6597800,6601087,"And the mostastonishing thing happened.","Spectre"
"1002",6601159,6602320,"Didn't you notice?","Spectre"
"1003",6602840,6605002,"He wasn't there anymore.","Spectre"
"1004",6605359,6607726,"He'd gone even thoughhe was still alive.","Spectre"
"1005",6607800,6611690,"So in this brief momentbetween life and death,","Spectre"
"1006",6611760,6614604,"there was nobodyinside his skull.","Spectre"
"1007",6616159,6617490,"Most odd.","Spectre"
"1008",6619399,6620810,"So, James.","Spectre"
"1009",6622720,6625529,"I'm going to penetrate","Spectre"
"1010",6626319,6628720,"to where you are.","Spectre"
"1011",6629479,6631720,"To the inside of your head.","Spectre"
"1012",6632800,6635564,"Now, the first probewill play with your sight,","Spectre"
"1013",6635920,6637046,"your hearing","Spectre"
"1014",6637680,6639807,"and your balance,","Spectre"
"1015",6639880,6642724,"just with the subtlestof manipulations.","Spectre"
"1016",6642880,6644927,"Well, get on with it then.","Spectre"
"1017",6645560,6648881,"Nothing can be as painfulas listening to you talk.","Spectre"
"1018",6649680,6651045,"All right.","Spectre"
"1019",6651800,6653244,"Let's begin.","Spectre"
"1020",6685880,6687881,"Why are you doing this?","Spectre"
"1021",6701079,6703207,"You probably knowthat James here","Spectre"
"1022",6703279,6705408,"lost his parentswhen he was young.","Spectre"
"1023",6708760,6711206,"But did you knowthat it was my father","Spectre"
"1024",6711279,6713680,"who helped himthrough this difficult time?","Spectre"
"1025",6721840,6723841,"Over the course of two winters","Spectre"
"1026",6723920,6728130,"he taught him to ski,and climb, and hunt.","Spectre"
"1027",6728920,6733323,"He soothed the woundsof the poor little blue-eyed orphan.","Spectre"
"1028",6735960,6738645,"Asked me to treathim as a brother.","Spectre"
"1029",6739159,6740923,"My little brother.","Spectre"
"1030",6742479,6744481,"They formed quite an attachment.","Spectre"
"1031",6746159,6747286,"So,","Spectre"
"1032",6748119,6749326,"you killed him.","Spectre"
"1033",6750840,6752329,"Yes, I did.","Spectre"
"1034",6755840,6758524,"You know what happenswhen a cuckoo","Spectre"
"1035",6758600,6761524,"hatches insideanother bird's nest?","Spectre"
"1036",6762800,6763961,"Yes.","Spectre"
"1037",6765000,6767445,"It forces the other eggs out.","Spectre"
"1038",6767520,6768567,"Yes.","Spectre"
"1039",6768840,6773845,"Well, this cuckoo made me realizemy father's life had to end.","Spectre"
"1040",6775199,6777770,"In a way, he's responsiblefor the path I took.","Spectre"
"1041",6778039,6780690,"- So, thank you.- Cuckoo.","Spectre"
"1042",6786520,6789444,"Do you know any otherbirdcalls, Franz?","Spectre"
"1043",6797000,6798331,"Hello, pussy.","Spectre"
"1044",6801039,6804646,"Franz Oberhauser died20 years ago, James.","Spectre"
"1045",6804720,6807484,"In an avalanche,alongside his father.","Spectre"
"1046",6808720,6813168,"The man you are talking to now,the man inside your head,","Spectre"
"1047",6813880,6816485,"is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.","Spectre"
"1048",6816880,6818369,"Catchy name.","Spectre"
"1049",6818880,6820881,"My mother's bloodline.","Spectre"
"1050",6822359,6826569,"If the needle finds the correct spotin the fusiform gyrus,","Spectre"
"1051",6827079,6829082,"you'll recognize no one.","Spectre"
"1052",6829319,6830970,"Of course,the faces of your women","Spectre"
"1053",6831039,6832929,"are interchangeable,aren't they, James?","Spectre"
"1054",6835079,6836684,"You won't know who she is.","Spectre"
"1055",6836760,6840002,"Just another passing faceon your way to the grave.","Spectre"
"1056",6848720,6851451,"He dies not knowing who you are.","Spectre"
"1057",6853720,6855609,"The daughter of an assassin.","Spectre"
"1058",6856239,6858242,"The only onewho could have understood him.","Spectre"
"1059",6859399,6860765,"Shame.","Spectre"
"1060",6897680,6899170,"I love you.","Spectre"
"1061",6904439,6906920,"Do those blue eyesstill recognize you?","Spectre"
"1062",6911319,6914130,"I'd recognize you anywhere.","Spectre"
"1063",6916359,6917725,"The watch.","Spectre"
"1064",6933159,6934570,"One minute.","Spectre"
"1065",6936000,6937489,"One minute.","Spectre"
"1066",6941520,6943283,"Did he say something?","Spectre"
"1067",6943359,6944690,"Tempus fugit.","Spectre"
"1068",6946520,6949204,"- What?- Tempus fugit.","Spectre"
"1069",6949680,6951681,"I can't hear you, James.","Spectre"
"1070",6954079,6955411,"I said,","Spectre"
"1071",6956199,6958042,"doesn't time fly?","Spectre"
"1072",6985359,6986690,"In there!","Spectre"
"1073",7028279,7029770,"Let's go home.","Spectre"
"1074",7045960,7047644,"It's not over yet.","Spectre"
"1075",7097479,7099050,"I've never evenheard of Hildebrand.","Spectre"
"1076",7099119,7102363,"That is the generalidea with safe houses.","Spectre"
"1077",7119319,7120970,"Exactly how safe is this, sir?","Spectre"
"1078",7121039,7122882,"We're about to find out.","Spectre"
"1079",7126319,7127810,"It's safe.","Spectre"
"1080",7127880,7129529,"Better wait here.","Spectre"
"1081",7133000,7134126,"I'm M.","Spectre"
"1082",7134199,7135247,"Madeleine Swann.","Spectre"
"1083",7135319,7136319,"Pleased to meet you.","Spectre"
"1084",7136359,7138203,"So, what do youhave for me, 007?","Spectre"
"1085",7138279,7142364,"The recently deceased head of Spectre,Ernst Stavro Blofeld,","Spectre"
"1086",7143000,7146845,"and his chief of intelligence,your new best friend, C.","Spectre"
"1087",7148239,7151243,"About to take control of hisvery own global surveillance system","Spectre"
"1088",7151319,7153800,"that he built righthere under our noses.","Spectre"
"1089",7153880,7156326,"Then we'd better move.The system goes online at midnight.","Spectre"
"1090",7156720,7159609,"If that happens,Spectre will have control of everything.","Spectre"
"1091",7159680,7161648,"So, you and I willhave a quiet word with C","Spectre"
"1092",7161720,7164404,"while Q hacks into the systemand stops it going online.","Spectre"
"1093",7165039,7166041,"It won't be easy.","Spectre"
"1094",7166119,7168520,"He'll find a way.He always does.","Spectre"
"1095",7173319,7175208,"It's good to have you back, 007.","Spectre"
"1096",7176079,7177161,"Sir.","Spectre"
"1097",7186760,7188603,"James, I can't.","Spectre"
"1098",7189359,7192283,"I'll come back for youwhen it's all over.","Spectre"
"1099",7193279,7194850,"No, I can't.","Spectre"
"1100",7195279,7197282,"No, you can'tstay here, or you...","Spectre"
"1101",7197960,7202170,"I can't go back to this life.And I'm not going to ask you to change.","Spectre"
"1102",7202880,7204369,"This is who you are.","Spectre"
"1103",7207119,7208689,"You're saying good-bye.","Spectre"
"1104",7209439,7210565,"Yes.","Spectre"
"1105",7212760,7214091,"Take care.","Spectre"
"1106",7216520,7218521,"You're a good man, James.","Spectre"
"1107",7279680,7281250,"Are you in yet, Q?","Spectre"
"1108",7281680,7284001,"A few layers of impenetrablesecurity still to go,","Spectre"
"1109",7284079,7286047,"but I thinkI'm getting somewhere.","Spectre"
"1110",7334479,7336050,"They've seen us! Reverse!","Spectre"
"1111",7375960,7377121,"Go!","Spectre"
"1112",7388159,7390127,"Get him in the building!","Spectre"
"1113",7390239,7392447,"Move. Move!","Spectre"
"1114",7471399,7474926,"Go back and find M, now!We need them both.","Spectre"
"1115",7484399,7487243,"Not a good feelingbeing watched, is it?","Spectre"
"1116",7491920,7493842,"Don't tell me you'reresponsible for this.","Spectre"
"1117",7493920,7496810,"No, but my Quartermaster is.","Spectre"
"1118",7496880,7498609,"And he's extremely talented.","Spectre"
"1119",7498720,7499766,"Well, bravo.","Spectre"
"1120",7499840,7504243,"But in case you hadn't realized it,you two are out of a job.","Spectre"
"1121",7504319,7505560,"So you're trespassing.","Spectre"
"1122",7505640,7508086,"I'm afraid you've gotthe wrong end of the stick, Max.","Spectre"
"1123",7508159,7510925,"We're going tostop this system going online.","Spectre"
"1124",7511000,7512411,"And then I'm goingto bring you in.","Spectre"
"1125",7512520,7514045,"On what grounds exactly?","Spectre"
"1126",7514359,7516248,"Poor taste in friends.","Spectre"
"1127",7552600,7555001,"Take a look at the world.","Spectre"
"1128",7556600,7557761,"Chaos.","Spectre"
"1129",7558880,7560802,"Because people like you,","Spectre"
"1130",7560880,7562324,"paper-pushers and politicians,","Spectre"
"1131",7562439,7565966,"are too spineless to dowhat needs to be done.","Spectre"
"1132",7566439,7569886,"So I made an alliance to putthe power where it should be.","Spectre"
"1133",7569960,7575000,"And now you want to throwit away for the sake of ""democracy.""","Spectre"
"1134",7575600,7577283,"Whatever the hell that is.","Spectre"
"1135",7577840,7580411,"How predictably moronic.","Spectre"
"1136",7580479,7583847,"But then isn't thatwhat M stands for?","Spectre"
"1137",7585680,7587648,"""Moron.""","Spectre"
"1138",7588720,7591041,"And now we knowwhat C stands for.","Spectre"
"1139",7595680,7597011,"""Careless.""","Spectre"
"1140",7636279,7637930,"Come on.","Spectre"
"1141",7638039,7639804,"No, no, no!","Spectre"
"1142",7704079,7707368,"You're a hard manto kill, Blofeld.","Spectre"
"1143",7713800,7715962,"Ouch.","Spectre"
"1144",7716560,7718288,"I do hope thatdoesn't hurt too much.","Spectre"
"1145",7719600,7723046,"My wounds will heal.","Spectre"
"1146",7723119,7724770,"What about yours?","Spectre"
"1147",7726319,7728640,"Look around you, James. Look.","Spectre"
"1148",7729079,7731287,"This is what'sleft of your world.","Spectre"
"1149",7731560,7735770,"Everything you ever stood for,everything you believed in, a ruin.","Spectre"
"1150",7736920,7739445,"Why are we here?","Spectre"
"1151",7740680,7742444,"Did you miss me?","Spectre"
"1152",7743319,7744605,"No.","Spectre"
"1153",7751239,7754323,"But I know someone who does.","Spectre"
"1154",7761520,7763601,"Where is she?","Spectre"
"1155",7764399,7766845,"That's for you to find out.","Spectre"
"1156",7774359,7777363,"In three minutes,this building will be demolished.","Spectre"
"1157",7778439,7780680,"I can get out easily.","Spectre"
"1158",7780760,7782807,"Now, you have a choice.","Spectre"
"1159",7782920,7785445,"Die trying to save her or","Spectre"
"1160",7785520,7787921,"save yourself andlive with the pain.","Spectre"
"1161",7789079,7790206,"You're bluffing.","Spectre"

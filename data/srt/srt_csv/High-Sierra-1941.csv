"194",1010959,1013018,"Great, big, strapping man, too.","High Sierra"

"233",1120936,1122494,"Lots of them do.","High Sierra"
"234",1122671,1124571,"But I was always thinkingabout a crash-out.","High Sierra"
"235",1124640,1128076,"I tried it once at the prison farmwhere they sent me for good behavior.","High Sierra"
"236",1128143,1131442,"But the fix blew upand a screw put the blast on me.","High Sierra"
"237",1131680,1135172,"Yeah, then the worst of it wasthey sent me back behind those big walls.","High Sierra"
"238",1135250,1138981,"We were just getting ready for anothercrash-out when my pardon came.","High Sierra"

"272",1246962,1250159,"Babe and I kind of figuredour best getaway was over the pass.","High Sierra"
"273",1250432,1253560,"Nobody will ever expect usto cross the Sierras to get into L.A.","High Sierra"
"274",1253735,1255794,"Suppose it would blow up a storm?","High Sierra"
"275",1256138,1258834,"If the pass got blocked up, then what?","High Sierra"

"286",1284266,1285358,"Yeah.","High Sierra"
"287",1286101,1289537,"Say, you know that gun reminds meof one time, nine or 10 years ago.","High Sierra"
"288",1289604,1292630,"We was getting ready to do a jobback in Iowa...","High Sierra"
"289",1292708,1294767,"when one of the guys got the shakes.","High Sierra"

"291",1298680,1301171,"and a bunch of cops are waitingfor us at the bank.","High Sierra"
"292",1301249,1303376,"But we don't say nothing.","High Sierra"
"293",1303585,1305644,"Lefty Jackson goes out and gets his gun.","High Sierra"

"296",1313729,1317187,"Pretty soon,Lefty just touched the trigger a little...","High Sierra"
"297",1317466,1319934,"and the gun went like that.","High Sierra"
"298",1321370,1325067,"The rat fell out of his chair, dead,and we drove off and left him there.","High Sierra"
"299",1325974,1328499,"Yeah, the gun just went....","High Sierra"

"325",1493575,1495736,"- Friends of yours?- Yeah. Why?","High Sierra"
"326",1495810,1498677,"I wondered. I know I've no chanceto collect, but I'm curious.","High Sierra"
"327",1498747,1500442,"I pull out from the curb and I get hit.","High Sierra"
"328",1500515,1502779,"- Look at my fender.- But you didn't make no signal.","High Sierra"
"329",1502851,1505843,"You talk about collecting.Be careful, you may have to pay off.","High Sierra"

"333",1513028,1515724,"I got clipped,but I'm satisfied if this guy is.","High Sierra"
"334",1515797,1518891,"Well, I guess if Mr. Pfiffer's satisfied, I am.","High Sierra"
"335",1518967,1522300,"All right, come on, let's break this up.Back on the sidewalk.","High Sierra"
"336",1522404,1524770,"Listen, fellow.These people ain't got any dough.","High Sierra"

"342",1540188,1541746,"Look, she's a cripple, too.","High Sierra"
"343",1558473,1560407,"I guess it was really Velma's fault.","High Sierra"
"344",1560475,1562375,"She was gawking around,looking at things...","High Sierra"
"345",1562444,1565004,"and smacked right into that fellow's car.","High Sierra"
"346",1565080,1568379,"I was sure surprised when he gave youthat $100 to give me.","High Sierra"
"347",1568516,1571349,"I wouldn't worry about him, Pa.He's probably got plenty.","High Sierra"
"348",1571586,1574453,"Well, this is the second timeyou saved our lives, son.","High Sierra"
"349",1574522,1577855,"When Velma smashed into that car,I had 13 cents in my pocket...","High Sierra"
"350",1577926,1579917,"and a $5 bill in my shoe.","High Sierra"
"351",1579995,1582555,"Of course, the women didn't know it.Don't you tell them.","High Sierra"
"352",1582631,1584292,"Pa, you're all right.","High Sierra"
"353",1585367,1587699,"You said you camefrom Chicago, didn't you, Roy?","High Sierra"
"354",1587769,1591068,"I came out here from Chicago,but I'm really from Brookfield, Indiana.","High Sierra"

"356",1593475,1595067,"- Yeah.- I knew it.","High Sierra"
"357",1595143,1596371,"My folks had a farm.","High Sierra"
"358",1596444,1599709,"I said to Ma out there in the desert,you was our kind.","High Sierra"

"360",1604019,1605247,"- Say, Pa?- Yeah?","High Sierra"
"361",1607022,1609422,"Excuse me,I suppose it's none of my business...","High Sierra"
"362",1610525,1612720,"but what's wrong with Velma's foot?","High Sierra"
"363",1612794,1616286,"- It's a clubfoot, she was born that way.- Can't nothing be done about it?","High Sierra"
"364",1616364,1619993,"One time a doctor said she could beoperated, but the last few years...","High Sierra"
"365",1620068,1622263,"I've been so broke,we couldn't if we'd wanted to.","High Sierra"
"366",1622337,1625329,"We hurried with the dishes.We knew Pa'd be talking your ear off.","High Sierra"
"367",1625407,1627034,"Pa sure can talk.","High Sierra"
"368",1627842,1629400,"Isn't the air grand out here?","High Sierra"
"369",1631880,1633006,"Look at the stars.","High Sierra"
"370",1633948,1636109,"I never knewthere were so many in the sky.","High Sierra"
"371",1636951,1638976,"Back homeyou couldn't see them like that.","High Sierra"
"372",1639054,1641318,"It's always like this out in the desert.","High Sierra"
"373",1641389,1645348,"You see that bright blue star up there?Look at it sparkle.","High Sierra"
"374",1648963,1650624,"- You see that other one?- Where?","High Sierra"
"375",1650699,1651723,"Right there.","High Sierra"
"376",1651800,1653267,"Oh, I see it.","High Sierra"
"377",1653668,1655067,"That's Jupiter.","High Sierra"
"378",1656771,1658033,"How do you know?","High Sierra"
"379",1659874,1663605,"A fellow I used to know,he taught me all about the sky...","High Sierra"
"380",1664379,1666813,"and where we was,we didn't have much else to do.","High Sierra"
"381",1666881,1668906,"Is that star always up there like that?","High Sierra"
"382",1669050,1671382,"No. You see different starsat different times.","High Sierra"
"383",1671453,1674047,"They change with the seasons. Now, look.","High Sierra"
"384",1674689,1676680,"You see that one twinkling over there?","High Sierra"
"385",1676791,1678088,"Well, that's Venus.","High Sierra"
"386",1679728,1682754,"It makes you dizzy just looking at them.","High Sierra"
"387",1684165,1687965,"Sometimes when you're outin the night and you look up at the stars...","High Sierra"
"388",1688236,1691171,"you can almost feelthe motion of the earth.","High Sierra"
"389",1691239,1694470,"It's like a little ballthat's turning through the night...","High Sierra"
"390",1694676,1696644,"with us hanging onto it.","High Sierra"
"391",1697245,1700305,"Why, that sounds like poetry, Roy.It's pretty.","High Sierra"
"392",1704352,1708015,"Well, I guess I better be starting.I got a long drive ahead of me.","High Sierra"
"393",1708223,1710316,"Got a business appointment in L.A.","High Sierra"
"394",1710592,1712219,"I sure enjoyed that dinner.","High Sierra"

"396",1714496,1716760,"Now, don't you fail to look us upin Los Angeles.","High Sierra"
"397",1716831,1718992,"We might get lonesome. Especially Velma.","High Sierra"
"398",1719267,1722464,"Grandpa, you shouldn't say thingslike that. I'm surprised at you.","High Sierra"
"399",1722537,1725802,"I declare to goodness,the older you get, the sillier you act.","High Sierra"
"400",1725874,1729105,"Roy understands me.Me and Roy's old-timers.","High Sierra"

"414",1813661,1815788,"I was expecting him when you came in.","High Sierra"
"415",1815930,1818728,"He's running one of those health servicesunder a phony name.","High Sierra"
"416",1818800,1820791,"Help yourself to a drink.","High Sierra"
"417",1821636,1824537,"Well, Roy, how does it lookand what do you say?","High Sierra"
"418",1824606,1826233,"I can't see nothing wrong with it.","High Sierra"
"419",1826307,1829367,"If the boys don't blow up on me,it's a cinch.","High Sierra"
"420",1829644,1832670,"But, Mac, it's gonna makean awful big noise in the newspapers.","High Sierra"
"421",1832747,1834715,"Well, that's your headache, not mine.","High Sierra"

"513",2142722,2145088,"I don't think Velma wants himto look at her.","High Sierra"

"518",2155568,2157001,"He must have some reason.","High Sierra"
"519",2157070,2161006,"Maybe he likes Velma.She ain't married yet, and likely not to be.","High Sierra"
"520",2161074,2163975,"- And if you want my opinion--- We don't want your opinion.","High Sierra"

"536",2213460,2217055,"I don't know what's the right thing to do,but it seems to me...","High Sierra"
"537",2217130,2221089,"before you go putting out money,I ought to tell you about Velma.","High Sierra"
"538",2223136,2224660,"What about her?","High Sierra"
"539",2227073,2231066,"She's got a fellow back home.His name's Preiser.","High Sierra"

"541",2235515,2239417,"He's doing good in the insurance business,but it didn't look right...","High Sierra"
"542",2239486,2242978,"a divorced man running aroundwith a crippled girl.","High Sierra"
"543",2243056,2246958,"So Ma and me brings Velmaout here to her mother.","High Sierra"
"544",2247794,2251787,"Now, it's my guess thatVelma's still thinking about that fellow.","High Sierra"
"545",2252198,2254928,"Now mind,I don't think there's anything wrong.","High Sierra"
"546",2255001,2259199,"I'm always telling myself there wasn't.It makes me feel better.","High Sierra"
"547",2261074,2263668,"That's about all there is to it, Roy.","High Sierra"
"548",2264511,2266945,"I hope you ain't sore or anything.","High Sierra"
"549",2269382,2272249,"No, I ain't sore at nobody.","High Sierra"
"550",2273553,2277785,"I guess it sounds funny,and I ain't got the right words to fit it...","High Sierra"
"551",2278725,2283458,"but it seems as if I'd been close to Velmafor a million years.","High Sierra"
"552",2284197,2286188,"And knowing her like I do...","High Sierra"
"553",2286266,2290100,"nobody ain't ever gonna tell meshe's ever done a wrong thing.","High Sierra"
"554",2290436,2292768,"'Cause I know, you understand?","High Sierra"

"556",2295542,2297601,"All right, Roy, anything you say.","High Sierra"
"557",2297677,2299338,"Roy, he says it can be fixed.","High Sierra"

"646",2730810,2734007,"I'll run you over to Ballard.You can catch a bus.","High Sierra"
"647",2734180,2736114,"I haven't got a soul in L.A.","High Sierra"

"650",2741253,2743687,"Maybe I can stake you to a ticket.","High Sierra"
"651",2747159,2750026,"Remember what you were sayingthe other day about prison...","High Sierra"
"652",2750096,2754556,"and the way you kept from going crazyby thinking all the time about a crash-out?","High Sierra"
"653",2754634,2756693,"That's the way it's been with me.","High Sierra"
"654",2756769,2760296,"I've been trying to crash outever since I can remember.","High Sierra"
"655",2760573,2763599,"My old man used to get drunka couple of times a week...","High Sierra"

"658",2771350,2774649,"- I crashed out, just like you did.- I got you.","High Sierra"
"659",2775121,2779114,"Then I came down to L.A.and got a job in a dime-a-dance joint.","High Sierra"
"660",2780326,2781987,"It was a living...","High Sierra"
"661",2783729,2785993,"but I got pretty sick of being pawed over.","High Sierra"
"662",2786065,2789364,"So when Babe came along,I crashed out again.","High Sierra"
"663",2791404,2793804,"I thought Babe was the right guy.","High Sierra"
"664",2794774,2798437,"I guess I was never really hooked upwith any guys that wasn't wrong.","High Sierra"

"770",3281493,3284485,"The cops would pinch him and he'd sing,or I don't know guys.","High Sierra"
"771",3284563,3286394,"Roy, what about Pard?","High Sierra"
"772",3289168,3292626,"Take him over to Algernonand tell him to lock him up. Here's $5.","High Sierra"

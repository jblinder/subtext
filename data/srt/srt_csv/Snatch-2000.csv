"807",3281097,3285559,"You're always gonna have problemslifting a body in one piece.","Snatch"
"808",3285976,3287978,"Apparently, the best thing to do...","Snatch"
"809",3288271,3292900,"...is cut up a corpse into six piecesand pile it all together.","Snatch"
"810",3293818,3296403,"Would someone mind telling me,who are you?","Snatch"
"811",3296653,3299574,"When you got your six pieces,you gotta get rid of them.","Snatch"

"814",3314255,3316340,"You gotta starve the pigsfor a few days...","Snatch"
"815",3316590,3319802,"...then the chopped-up bodywill look like curry to a pisshead.","Snatch"
"816",3321346,3324849,"You gotta shave the heads of yourvictims and pull the teeth out...","Snatch"
"817",3325099,3326893,"... for the piggies' digestion.","Snatch"
"818",3327184,3329186,"You could do this afterwards,of course...","Snatch"

"820",3332898,3336735,"They will go through bone like butter.","Snatch"
"821",3337237,3341032,"You need at least 16 pigsto finish the job in one sitting...","Snatch"
"822",3341324,3345286,"...so be wary of any manwho keeps a pig farm.","Snatch"
"823",3345536,3348748,"They will go through a bodythat weighs 200 pounds...","Snatch"
"824",3349039,3350916,"...in about eight minutes.","Snatch"
"825",3351166,3352751,"That means that a single pig...","Snatch"
"826",3353043,3356713,"...can consume two poundsof uncooked flesh...","Snatch"
"827",3357005,3358967,"...every minute.","Snatch"
"828",3359592,3361552,"Hence the expression...","Snatch"

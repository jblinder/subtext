"21",198198,199865,"With what intention?","The Shawshank Redemption"
"22",200449,201908,"I'm not sure.","The Shawshank Redemption"

"54",324781,327326,"But was their crime so great...","The Shawshank Redemption"
"55",327576,329786,"as to merit a death sentence?","The Shawshank Redemption"
"56",329995,332288,"While you think about that...","The Shawshank Redemption"
"57",333750,335542,"think about this:","The Shawshank Redemption"

"62",348473,350432,"This was revenge...","The Shawshank Redemption"
"63",350600,354269,"of a much more brutal,cold-blooded nature. Consider this:","The Shawshank Redemption"
"64",354437,356855,"Four bullets per victim.","The Shawshank Redemption"
"65",357606,359316,"Not six shots fired, but eight.","The Shawshank Redemption"
"66",359817,363444,"That means that he firedthe gun empty...","The Shawshank Redemption"
"67",363653,366447,"and then stopped to reload...","The Shawshank Redemption"
"68",366615,369283,"so that he could shooteach of them again.","The Shawshank Redemption"
"69",369494,372079,"An extra bullet per lover...","The Shawshank Redemption"

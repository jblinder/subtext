"960",4489819,4491412,"which no one can control.","Doctor Strange"
"961",4491569,4494243,"Not even the greatDoctor Stephen Strange.","Doctor Strange"
"962",4494489,4496583,"Not even Dormammu?","Doctor Strange"
"963",4498243,4500087,"He offers immortality.","Doctor Strange"
"964",4500246,4502247,"It's our fear of deaththat gives Dormammu life.","Doctor Strange"

"1058",5007502,5009301,"I've spent so many years...","Doctor Strange"
"1059",5009378,5011096,"peering through time...","Doctor Strange"
"1060",5011256,5013759,"looking at this exact moment.","Doctor Strange"
"1061",5013841,5015469,"But I can't see past it.","Doctor Strange"
"1062",5016136,5019685,"I've prevented countless,terrible futures.","Doctor Strange"
"1063",5019765,5022359,"And after each one,there's always another.","Doctor Strange"

"1071",5037908,5040252,"Only its possibilities.","Doctor Strange"
"1072",5040327,5043046,"You have such a capacity for goodness.","Doctor Strange"
"1073",5043247,5045123,"You always excelled...","Doctor Strange"
"1074",5045207,5047710,"but not because you craved success...","Doctor Strange"
"1075",5047792,5050261,"but because of your fear of failure.","Doctor Strange"
"1076",5050337,5052088,"That's what made me a great doctor.","Doctor Strange"
"1077",5052296,5054890,"It's precisely what kept youfrom greatness.","Doctor Strange"
"1078",5056009,5058056,"Arrogance and fear still keep you...","Doctor Strange"
"1079",5058136,5059512,"from learning the simplest","Doctor Strange"
"1080",5059595,5061644,"and most significant lesson of all.","Doctor Strange"
"1081",5061722,5062724,"Which is?","Doctor Strange"
"1082",5064976,5067195,"It's not about you.","Doctor Strange"
"1083",5070983,5072279,"When you first came to me...","Doctor Strange"
"1084",5072359,5075533,"you asked me how I was ableto heal Jonathan Pangborn.","Doctor Strange"
"1085",5076529,5077827,"I didn't.","Doctor Strange"
"1086",5079740,5083996,"He channels dimensional energydirectly into his own body.","Doctor Strange"
"1087",5084162,5085913,"He uses magic to walk?","Doctor Strange"
"1088",5085997,5087170,"Constantly.","Doctor Strange"
"1089",5087748,5089591,"He had a choice...","Doctor Strange"
"1090",5090377,5092345,"to return to his own life...","Doctor Strange"
"1091",5092921,5095219,"or to serve somethinggreater than himself.","Doctor Strange"
"1092",5095298,5097972,"So I could have my hands back again?","Doctor Strange"
"1093",5098051,5099472,"My old life?","Doctor Strange"
"1094",5100136,5101389,"You could.","Doctor Strange"
"1095",5102471,5105270,"And the world would beall the lesser for it.","Doctor Strange"
"1096",5106851,5110152,"I've hated drawing powerfrom the Dark Dimension.","Doctor Strange"
"1097",5110229,5111402,"But as you well know...","Doctor Strange"
"1098",5111480,5113859,"sometimes one must break the rules...","Doctor Strange"
"1099",5113942,5115739,"in order to serve the greater good.","Doctor Strange"
"1100",5115985,5117908,"Mordo won't see it that way.","Doctor Strange"
"1101",5117988,5120615,"Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...","Doctor Strange"
"1102",5120698,5122917,"forged by the fires of his youth.","Doctor Strange"
"1103",5123159,5124912,"He needs your flexibility...","Doctor Strange"
"1104",5124994,5127042,"just as you need his strength.","Doctor Strange"
"1105",5128164,5131840,"Only together do you stand a chanceof stopping Dormammu.","Doctor Strange"
"1106",5132085,5133552,"I'm not ready.","Doctor Strange"
"1107",5135631,5137052,"No one ever is.","Doctor Strange"
"1108",5138716,5140890,"We don't get to choose our time.","Doctor Strange"
"1109",5145015,5147234,"Death is what gives life meaning.","Doctor Strange"
"1110",5148351,5150945,"To know your days are numbered.","Doctor Strange"
"1111",5151020,5153069,"Your time is short.","Doctor Strange"
"1112",5155024,5157323,"You'd think afterall this time, I'd be ready.","Doctor Strange"
"1113",5158278,5159996,"But look at me.","Doctor Strange"
"1114",5160072,5163076,"Stretching one moment outinto a thousand...","Doctor Strange"
"1115",5163324,5165668,"just so that I can watch the snow.","Doctor Strange"
"1116",5204408,5205829,"Are you okay?","Doctor Strange"
"1117",5213625,5215752,"I don't understand what's happening.","Doctor Strange"
"1118",5215918,5217011,"I know.","Doctor Strange"
"1119",5217796,5220675,"But I have to go away now.","Doctor Strange"
"1120",5225595,5228474,"You said that losing my handsdidn't have to be the end.","Doctor Strange"
"1121",5228556,5230229,"That it could be a beginning.","Doctor Strange"
"1122",5230434,5231480,"Yeah.","Doctor Strange"
"1123",5232978,5235697,"Because there are other waysto save lives.","Doctor Strange"
"1124",5238817,5240319,"A harder way.","Doctor Strange"
"1125",5242570,5244823,"A weirder way.","Doctor Strange"
"1126",5244905,5246828,"Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.","Doctor Strange"
"1127",5246908,5248534,"Doctor Palmer to the ER.","Doctor Strange"
"1128",5252831,5254673,"I don't want you to go.","Doctor Strange"
"1129",5302756,5303927,"Stop!","Doctor Strange"

"1136",5378747,5379965,"You were right.","Doctor Strange"
"1137",5381208,5383211,"She wasn't who I thought she was.","Doctor Strange"
"1138",5384378,5386131,"She was complicated.","Doctor Strange"
"1139",5390719,5392140,"Complicated?","Doctor Strange"
"1140",5395431,5397775,"The Dark Dimension is volatile.","Doctor Strange"
"1141",5397975,5399148,"Dangerous.","Doctor Strange"
"1142",5399935,5401188,"What if it overtook her?","Doctor Strange"
"1143",5403230,5405449,"She taught us it was forbidden...","Doctor Strange"
"1144",5406359,5410238,"while she drew on its powerto steal centuries of life.","Doctor Strange"
"1145",5410322,5412164,"She did what she thought was right.","Doctor Strange"
"1146",5412239,5413957,"The bill comes due.","Doctor Strange"
"1147",5414868,5416289,"Don't you see?","Doctor Strange"
"1148",5417828,5421253,"Her transgressionsled the Zealots to Dormammu.","Doctor Strange"
"1149",5421332,5424802,"Kaecilius was her fault!","Doctor Strange"
"1150",5425587,5426712,"And here we are...","Doctor Strange"
"1151",5426796,5429048,"in the consequence of her deception.","Doctor Strange"

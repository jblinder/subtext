"221",1763888,1767259,"- The shape of the mouth.- Whale's mouth?","Jaws 2"
"222",1767309,1769551,"- Shark's mouth.- What shark?","Jaws 2"
"223",1769604,1771728,"The shark that did this.","Jaws 2"
"224",1771773,1773980,"We don't know that, do we?","Jaws 2"
"225",1774027,1777359,"- That's what we're here to find out.- And we will.","Jaws 2"

"235",1806438,1809010,"This is a mammal, not a fish.","Jaws 2"
"236",1809065,1812101,"Don't quibble!Is it a shark bite or isn't it?","Jaws 2"
"237",1812151,1813528,"Possibly.","Jaws 2"
"238",1813570,1816192,"But this is a killer whale.","Jaws 2"
"239",1816240,1819573,"It would have to be a sharkof considerable size.","Jaws 2"
"240",1822913,1827577,"We know sharks are attractedby blood and thrashing about.","Jaws 2"
"241",1827628,1829170,"And sound.","Jaws 2"

"245",1836011,1838763,"Any rhythmic,low-frequency vibration.","Jaws 2"
"246",1838807,1840798,"So there could be one around?","Jaws 2"
"247",1840849,1845430,"Not necessarily. These wounds couldhave been inflicted out to sea.","Jaws 2"
"248",1845480,1849692,"None were immediately fatal. Thecurrents could have carried it in.","Jaws 2"
"249",1849736,1853651,"- We got a hell of a tide.- Just take care of the crowd!","Jaws 2"
"250",1853698,1854730,"Dad?","Jaws 2"

"255",1868381,1870505,"Mike, give me a break, will you?","Jaws 2"
"256",1876432,1880217,"It's either a great whiteor another killer whale.","Jaws 2"
"257",1880269,1882262,"I'd like to know which.","Jaws 2"
"258",1882314,1884934,"It's impossible to tellwith that body.","Jaws 2"
"259",1884983,1889362,"The anima""s been ashore for 12 hoursand drifting for a day at least.","Jaws 2"
"260",1889404,1892240,"Every nibblerin the sea's taken a bite.","Jaws 2"
"261",1893743,1897576,"I know dolphins communicate.I mean, they send signals.","Jaws 2"
"262",1897623,1902000,"If a shark was destroyed,could another shark come and...","Jaws 2"
"263",1902044,1905211,"Sharks don't take things personally,Mr Brody.","Jaws 2"

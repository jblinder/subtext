"223",1594108,1596435,"and a bad idea to fly himon a commercial carrier.","Mission: Impossible II"
"224",1596987,1601241,"- Is he still in Sydney?- Dr Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.","Mission: Impossible II"
"225",1602826,1605537,"So is his colleague Gradski,but that happened earlier.","Mission: Impossible II"
"226",1606386,1610759,"We had Nekhorvich on a flight fromSydney that crashed in the Rockies.","Mission: Impossible II"
"227",1611209,1614263,"- Dead?- Are you listening to me?","Mission: Impossible II"
"228",1616213,1618509,"If he didn't wantto go anywhere without me,","Mission: Impossible II"
"229",1620358,1621894,"how did you get himon that flight?","Mission: Impossible II"
"230",1622345,1624365,"Oh, you were there.","Mission: Impossible II"
"231",1631922,1634074,"When I couldn't find you,I had to replace you.","Mission: Impossible II"
"232",1634324,1636442,"Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.","Mission: Impossible II"
"233",1636692,1639064,"Now, he doubled you, what,two or three times?","Mission: Impossible II"
"234",1641913,1644384,"- Twice.- What did you think of him?","Mission: Impossible II"
"235",1647444,1649022,"We had our reservationsabout each other.","Mission: Impossible II"
"236",1649073,1651392,"Isn't it a little lateto be asking me that?","Mission: Impossible II"
"237",1651541,1654412,"No, not necessarily.Airline records...","Mission: Impossible II"
"238",1655961,1659924,"list a Captain Harold Macintoshas the pilot of flight 2207.","Mission: Impossible II"
"239",1660174,1663636,"As far as the media and allgovernment agencies are concerned,","Mission: Impossible II"
"240",1663886,1665888,"Captain Macintoshdied on the flight.","Mission: Impossible II"
"241",1666638,1668141,"But, in fact, he missed it.","Mission: Impossible II"
"242",1668990,1672011,"He did, however,make the next flight...","Mission: Impossible II"
"243",1672061,1673013,"in cargo.","Mission: Impossible II"
"244",1673864,1677784,"Stuffed into a rather smallsuitcase, considering his size.","Mission: Impossible II"
"245",1678634,1680988,"Now, someone on that flightplanned an operation...","Mission: Impossible II"
"246",1681038,1683707,"designed to bring the plane downand make it look like an accident.","Mission: Impossible II"
"247",1683758,1686827,"Someone skilful enough to bringthe whole thing off without a hitch.","Mission: Impossible II"
"248",1688577,1690472,"So there's one thing we knowthat Ambrose doesn't.","Mission: Impossible II"
"249",1691623,1695000,"You do think it was Ambrose?You're not surprised?","Mission: Impossible II"
"250",1695250,1698922,"Sean feels he hasn't done the job unlesshe leaves a lot of hats on the ground.","Mission: Impossible II"
"251",1699172,1703693,"The question is why? What was this,uh, Chimera, Nekhorvich was carrying?","Mission: Impossible II"
"252",1704844,1706730,"Only Ambrose knows that.","Mission: Impossible II"
"253",1707080,1711911,"In any case, you must recover this...whatever... Chimera, and bring it to us.","Mission: Impossible II"
"254",1713861,1717023,"In order to do that, I have to figureout how he plans to make money with it.","Mission: Impossible II"
"255",1717273,1719470,"That is where Miss Hall comes in.","Mission: Impossible II"
"256",1724197,1725148,"Excuse me?","Mission: Impossible II"
"257",1726098,1728034,"Miss Hall and Ambrosehad a relationship...","Mission: Impossible II"
"258",1728285,1729510,"which he took very seriously.","Mission: Impossible II"
"259",1729760,1732489,"She walked away, and he's beenwanting her back ever since.","Mission: Impossible II"
"260",1732739,1735858,"We believe she's our surestand quickest way of locating him.","Mission: Impossible II"
"261",1736209,1737243,"And then what?","Mission: Impossible II"
"262",1737494,1740596,"Well, make sureshe continues to see him,","Mission: Impossible II"
"263",1740747,1743917,"gets him to confide in her,and report to you.","Mission: Impossible II"
"264",1758381,1762818,"You made it sound as if I was recruitingher for her skills as a thief.","Mission: Impossible II"
"265",1763969,1767332,"Well, then I misled you,or you made the wrong assumption.","Mission: Impossible II"
"266",1767382,1771036,"Either way, we're asking herto resume a prior relationship,","Mission: Impossible II"
"267",1771286,1773329,"not do anythingshe hasn't already done.","Mission: Impossible II"
"268",1773579,1775567,"Voluntarily, I might add.","Mission: Impossible II"
"269",1778167,1781086,"No, she's got no trainingfor this kind of thing.","Mission: Impossible II"
"270",1781337,1784089,"What, to go to bed with a manand lie to him? She's a woman.","Mission: Impossible II"
"271",1784340,1786186,"She's got allthe training she needs.","Mission: Impossible II"
"272",1792448,1793933,"I don't thinkI can get her to do it.","Mission: Impossible II"
"273",1794983,1797194,"- You mean it'll be difficult.- Very.","Mission: Impossible II"
"274",1797246,1800548,"Well, this is not Mission Difficult,Mr Hunt, it's Mission Impossible.","Mission: Impossible II"
"275",1800699,1802542,"Difficult should bea walk in the park for you.","Mission: Impossible II"
"276",1802893,1804069,"I'm open to suggestion.","Mission: Impossible II"
"277",1804119,1807048,"If you can think of a quicker way,you're welcome to try.","Mission: Impossible II"
"278",1807097,1808932,"You might take a look at these...","Mission: Impossible II"
"279",1808982,1811804,"if you have any further qualmsabout getting her to do the job.","Mission: Impossible II"
"280",1870093,1873699,"How many people are capableof something like that?","Mission: Impossible II"
"281",1878125,1880506,"Sean Ambrose, for one.","Mission: Impossible II"
"282",1887928,1888588,"Right.","Mission: Impossible II"
"283",1899855,1901903,"This wasn't whatI had in mind, Nyah.","Mission: Impossible II"
"284",1906587,1908416,"But it is what you'dlike me to do.","Mission: Impossible II"
"285",1913494,1917207,"What? Oh, let my consciencebe my guide, is that it?","Mission: Impossible II"
"286",1917557,1918557,"Something like that.","Mission: Impossible II"
"287",1918607,1921578,"I don't have a conscience.I'm a bloody thief.","Mission: Impossible II"
"288",1925457,1927483,"Are you gonna tryand force me to do this?","Mission: Impossible II"
"289",1927733,1929986,"Generally, I don't favourcoercing someone,","Mission: Impossible II"
"290",1930036,1932698,"not when there's a chancemy life could end up in their hands.","Mission: Impossible II"
"291",1933949,1936951,"- Is that the only reason?- Can you think of a better one?","Mission: Impossible II"
"292",1937001,1939703,"Me? No.But I was just hoping that you might,","Mission: Impossible II"
"293",1939755,1942999,"thinking that somewhere, this gotpersonal as well as physical!","Mission: Impossible II"
"294",1943249,1946211,"Would it make you feel any betterif I didn't want you to do this?","Mission: Impossible II"
"295",1946461,1949123,"- Yeah, much.- Then feel better!","Mission: Impossible II"
"296",1986542,1988769,"You know, Sean will neverbe anything but suspicious...","Mission: Impossible II"
"297",1988820,1991290,"if I pitch up saying,""Hey, honey, I'm home. ""","Mission: Impossible II"
"298",1993141,1995050,"What wouldn'tmake him suspicious?","Mission: Impossible II"

"354",2417215,2422163,"Yeah? We just rolled upa snowball and tossed it into hell.","Mission: Impossible II"
"355",2423813,2426074,"Now we'll seewhat chance it has.","Mission: Impossible II"
"356",2428025,2429137,"Try it on.","Mission: Impossible II"
"357",2433431,2434135,"Go ahead.","Mission: Impossible II"
"358",2441847,2444235,"I'm dying to seeif I remembered your size.","Mission: Impossible II"
"359",2474530,2477449,"You're not interestedin seeing how it looks?","Mission: Impossible II"
"360",2477701,2479561,"Oh, I am.","Mission: Impossible II"
"361",2482871,2483934,"Later.","Mission: Impossible II"
"362",2507797,2509617,"Every search for a hero...","Mission: Impossible II"
"363",2509967,2513320,"must begin with somethingthat every hero requires...","Mission: Impossible II"
"364",2513570,2514688,"a villain.","Mission: Impossible II"
"365",2515739,2519951,"Therefore, in the searchfor our hero, Bellerophon,","Mission: Impossible II"
"366",2520201,2523788,"we created a monster, Chimera.","Mission: Impossible II"
"367",2524039,2526532,"Nekhorvich wasa molecular biologist.","Mission: Impossible II"
"368",2526583,2529085,"Why is he going onabout an old Greek myth?","Mission: Impossible II"

"372",2540639,2542617,"A monster with the head of a lion...","Mission: Impossible II"

"374",2547228,2548757,"who plagued the ancient world.","Mission: Impossible II"
"375",2550606,2553576,"I think Nekhorvich createda monster virus named Chimera...","Mission: Impossible II"
"376",2554525,2556362,"and the antivirus to kill it,","Mission: Impossible II"
"377",2556612,2558280,"named Bellerophon.","Mission: Impossible II"
"378",2560331,2561668,"That simple, huh?","Mission: Impossible II"
"379",2563844,2564599,"Why not?","Mission: Impossible II"
"380",2583206,2585733,"Ł37 million.","Mission: Impossible II"
"381",2586784,2589590,"Now, that's a promising bidfor Nekhorvich's work.","Mission: Impossible II"
"382",2592190,2595570,"Don't look so worried, Hugh.We're halfway there.","Mission: Impossible II"
"383",2598989,2600525,"We'll need this at the track...","Mission: Impossible II"
"384",2602875,2604471,"if we're gonna get the other half.","Mission: Impossible II"
"385",2614838,2618643,"Well, then... sorted.","Mission: Impossible II"
"386",2625764,2626867,"Not everything.","Mission: Impossible II"
"387",2629219,2631481,"Why do you thinkshe's really here?","Mission: Impossible II"
"388",2634023,2636076,"From her point of view or mine?","Mission: Impossible II"
"389",2636525,2638913,"Well, she wasn'texactly gagging for it...","Mission: Impossible II"
"390",2638963,2641384,"when she left you six months ago.","Mission: Impossible II"
"391",2644284,2646172,"The question is,do you trust her?","Mission: Impossible II"
"392",2655045,2656922,"One considers her timing, of course.","Mission: Impossible II"
"393",2657172,2660592,"Getting nicked within a weekof the plane going down.","Mission: Impossible II"
"394",2660842,2665005,"Suggestive,even borderline suspicious,","Mission: Impossible II"
"395",2665855,2667693,"but hardly conclusive.","Mission: Impossible II"
"396",2673521,2675858,"Well, you've thought about it,at any rate.","Mission: Impossible II"
"397",2681570,2682389,"Tell me, Hugh,","Mission: Impossible II"
"398",2683840,2687929,"you don't exactly hang on Nyah'severy word and gesture, do you?","Mission: Impossible II"
"399",2691581,2693260,"That's a fairly ratty nail that.","Mission: Impossible II"
"400",2698588,2699773,"Sean, please!","Mission: Impossible II"
"401",2700623,2705704,"Suppose she is some sort of Trojanhorse sent in by IMF to spy on us.","Mission: Impossible II"

"404",2715163,2717856,"I do! I do! I do! I do!","Mission: Impossible II"
"405",2719807,2720693,"- Now, Hugh,","Mission: Impossible II"
"406",2720943,2723947,"you must realizethat some of us...","Mission: Impossible II"
"407",2724197,2726240,"have the burdenof sex to deal with.","Mission: Impossible II"

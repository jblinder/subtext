"232",1817600,1819700,"I don't...","Flightplan"
"233",1823100,1825400,"I don't remember either way, sir.","Flightplan"
"234",1825500,1829200,"Sir, I did the count myself.26A was empty.","Flightplan"
"235",1829900,1833600,"- Did you tell him about the bear?- The bear?","Flightplan"
"236",1833700,1839300,"It was under her blanket. She wouldn'thave walked away without it.","Flightplan"
"237",1839400,1844100,"Have you had anything to drink on thisflight? Anything alcoholic at all?","Flightplan"
"238",1844300,1846300,"No.","Flightplan"
"239",1846400,1849000,"Are you under any medication?","Flightplan"
"240",1849900,1855200,"I have sleeping pills with me just likeevery other passenger on board.","Flightplan"
"241",1855300,1857900,"And I'm carrying Klonopin.","Flightplan"
"242",1859000,1862200,"For anxiety.I took two this morning.","Flightplan"
"243",1863300,1865500,"I see. How long have you been on them?","Flightplan"
"244",1865600,1868500,"- I'm not on them.- How long?","Flightplan"
"245",1869700,1873000,"I filled the prescription a week ago.","Flightplan"
"246",1873900,1876000,"When my husband died.","Flightplan"
"247",1877500,1881400,"My daughter and I are bringing his bodyback to Long Island for burial.","Flightplan"
"248",1881500,1887099,"There is a casket in the hold, sir,from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.","Flightplan"
"249",1887100,1892000,"He fell six days agofrom the roof of our building.","Flightplan"
"250",1901300,1904100,"Does anybody on boardremember seeing her?","Flightplan"
"251",1904200,1907700,"- Passengers in her row?- No one has said so, sir.","Flightplan"
"252",1907800,1913900,"There are 32 children on the manifest.They've all been accounted for.","Flightplan"
"253",1916100,1919000,"You were seated near her,Mr. Carson, right?","Flightplan"
"254",1919100,1922500,"- That's right.- Did you see her?","Flightplan"
"255",1926000,1928100,"No. I didn't.","Flightplan"
"256",1929500,1932600,"Think about what you're suggesting,captain.","Flightplan"
"257",1932700,1935400,"That I imagined bringing her on board...","Flightplan"
"258",1935500,1937900,"and that I'm now pretendingto look for her.","Flightplan"
"259",1938000,1941700,"Does that make any sense? Can youthink of a reason why I would do that?","Flightplan"
"260",1941800,1945600,"I'm not drunk, I'm not loaded,I'm not looking for attention.","Flightplan"
"261",1945700,1948500,"There are protocols about these things.","Flightplan"
"262",1948600,1953300,"If a pilot has an inaccurate passengermanifest, he must land the plane.","Flightplan"
"263",1953400,1956800,"A bear does not constitutean inaccurate passenger manifest.","Flightplan"
"264",1956900,1961100,"I'm telling you it's inaccurate. Thatmeans you have to search the plane,","Flightplan"
"265",1961200,1966600,"just like you would ifit was your own child that was missing.","Flightplan"
"266",1966800,1968800,"Julia's only six years old.","Flightplan"
"267",1968900,1972400,"She's not in good shape right now.She's scared of everything.","Flightplan"
"268",1972500,1978100,"I had to put her under my coat todayjust to get her in the car.","Flightplan"
"269",1978800,1984200,"But she did get in that car. She got onthis plane like every other person here.","Flightplan"
"270",1984300,1986100,"And I fell asleep.","Flightplan"
"271",1986200,1991500,"Which I should never have done.But she was right next to me.","Flightplan"
"272",1992800,1996300,"I was holding her hand when we took off.","Flightplan"
"273",1996900,1999000,"Please...","Flightplan"
"274",2000500,2002600,"You've got to help her.","Flightplan"
"275",2020400,2022100,"Get the lights up.","Flightplan"
"276",2022200,2025700,"Get every passenger seated.No one in the toilets. No exception.","Flightplan"

"279",2031300,2033400,"Are there any more questions?","Flightplan"
"280",2033500,2035600,"Thank you.","Flightplan"
"281",2045100,2048800,"Ladies and gentlemen,we apologize for the inconvenience...","Flightplan"
"282",2048900,2054000,"but the captain requests thatall passengers return to their seats.","Flightplan"
"283",2054100,2056600,"We'll turn off the seat-beltsign in a minute.","Flightplan"
"284",2056700,2061600,"Can you fasten that seat belt,please, ma'am? Thank you.","Flightplan"
"285",2064100,2067000,"I don't see what the fuss is about.","Flightplan"
"286",2067100,2070400,"It's not like she lost her Palm Pilot.","Flightplan"
"287",2084300,2088100,"A six-year-old girl climbing into avionics?","Flightplan"
"288",2090500,2092600,"This is really silly.","Flightplan"
"289",2093600,2096800,"- This is procedure.- Captain.","Flightplan"
"290",2096900,2099000,"Thanks.","Flightplan"
"291",2112200,2114300,"Anybody in here?","Flightplan"

"294",2144900,2146900,"Miss. I need to use the rest room.","Flightplan"
"295",2147000,2150200,"As soon as the captain'sturned off the seat-belt sign, sir.","Flightplan"
"296",2150300,2152399,"I don't need an escort.","Flightplan"
"297",2152400,2154900,"I'm responsible for any threat...","Flightplan"
"298",2155000,2158100,"- to the safety of this flight.- This is absurd.","Flightplan"
"299",2158200,2161600,"Women with imaginary children qualify.","Flightplan"
"300",2163200,2165300,"Sir, you'll have to return to your seat.","Flightplan"
"301",2165400,2168200,"- My back gets stiff...- I'm sorry.","Flightplan"
"302",2168300,2170800,"All passengers must remain in their seats.","Flightplan"
"303",2171000,2173000,"I know.","Flightplan"
"304",2173500,2176400,"Running out of magazines up here.","Flightplan"
"305",2178000,2182000,"Tell me something.What are you gonna do when we find her?","Flightplan"
"306",2182100,2184100,"How are you gonna explain yourself?","Flightplan"
"307",2184200,2189700,"It's not so bad if she's lost.Because then you just look lazy.","Flightplan"
"308",2191300,2195200,"But if somebody took her,if a crime was committed on this flight,","Flightplan"
"309",2195400,2199000,"and the law enforcement officialon board didn't do anything,","Flightplan"
"310",2199100,2201199,"how's that gonna look?","Flightplan"
"311",2201200,2203300,"You made your point.","Flightplan"
"312",2229000,2230800,"- Katerina.- What?","Flightplan"
"313",2230900,2233400,"- Have a look.- Why? Did you see something?","Flightplan"
"314",2233500,2239400,"No. It's just that I'm dyingto watch you crawl through that hatch.","Flightplan"
"315",2250200,2252300,"What's the problem?","Flightplan"
"316",2254200,2256500,"May I help you?","Flightplan"
"317",2256600,2258700,"Do I know you from somewhere?","Flightplan"
"318",2258800,2262100,"You've walked past me five timessince we took off.","Flightplan"
"319",2262300,2264299,"Does that count?","Flightplan"
"320",2264300,2267900,"- Are you from Berlin?- Am I being interrogated now?","Flightplan"
"321",2268000,2273000,"- I asked you if you're from Berlin.- No. I am not.","Flightplan"
"322",2274100,2276200,"Let's go.","Flightplan"
"323",2276900,2279000,"What was that all about?","Flightplan"
"324",2289000,2292300,"Think about what you're saying no to.It would be epic.","Flightplan"
"325",2292400,2294500,"You're terrible.","Flightplan"
"326",2298300,2302300,"My daughter.You were looking for my daughter.","Flightplan"
"327",2302700,2305900,"I need to speak to the captain again.","Flightplan"
"328",2306300,2309900,"Can you get himon the phone for me, please?","Flightplan"
"329",2310000,2312900,"OK. Can we look in the holds now?","Flightplan"
"330",2313600,2317400,"There is no way a child could havegained access to any of the holds.","Flightplan"
"331",2317500,2320700,"There's access to the forward holdsfrom galley two.","Flightplan"
"332",2320800,2324400,"- The call button's too high for...- So was the overhead bin.","Flightplan"
"333",2324500,2327500,"- She's with an adult. I told you...- What adult?","Flightplan"
"334",2327600,2332500,"- Every passenger is in his seat.- The passenger manifest is inaccurate.","Flightplan"
"335",2332600,2335300,"You've got to search the holds now.","Flightplan"
"336",2335500,2340100,"I'm sorry, Miss Pratt.I'm afraid I can't allow that.","Flightplan"
"337",2340400,2344000,"- Excuse me.- Godammit, are you listening?","Flightplan"
"338",2346500,2348799,"Wait.","Flightplan"
"339",2348800,2351600,"- I don't think it's such a bad idea.- What?","Flightplan"
"340",2351700,2354400,"It might be goodto have her below deck for a while.","Flightplan"
"341",2354600,2359000,"She is making the passengers anxious.Obviously I would go down with her.","Flightplan"
"342",2359100,2363900,"Mr. Carson, I am responsible for thesafety of every passenger on this plane.","Flightplan"
"343",2364000,2368000,"Even the delusional ones and I will nothave a passenger out of her seat...","Flightplan"
"344",2368100,2371100,"bouncing aroundwith the luggage bins in the holds.","Flightplan"
"345",2371200,2377300,"Any turbulence and you could be injured.And so could you, Mr. Carson.","Flightplan"
"346",2378100,2383900,"Now, we're going to continue to searchthis aircraft from the waist upwards.","Flightplan"
"347",2384000,2389500,"If we don't find anybody, I will sendtwo members of my crew into the holds.","Flightplan"
"348",2389600,2392300,"I just saw two members of your crew...","Flightplan"
"349",2392400,2395800,"and they did everythingexcept look for my daughter.","Flightplan"
"350",2395900,2399800,"Miss Pratt,there are 425 passengers on this flight...","Flightplan"
"351",2399900,2402700,"who are not receiving any attentionat the moment...","Flightplan"
"352",2402800,2406400,"because every one of my flightattendants are looking for a child...","Flightplan"
"353",2406500,2409200,"that none of them believewas ever on board.","Flightplan"
"354",2409300,2412600,"If you think we could be doing moreto meet your needs,","Flightplan"
"355",2412700,2416700,"then I suggest you take it upwith customer service after we land.","Flightplan"
"356",2416800,2420300,"Captain,can I speak to you for a moment?","Flightplan"
"357",2421700,2425200,"Mr. Carson,this woman is in your charge.","Flightplan"
"358",2425400,2428300,"I want her to remainin the passenger cabin.","Flightplan"

"363",2450900,2453900,"I know where I've seen you before.","Flightplan"
"364",2457000,2459200,"- What?- Where's my daughter?","Flightplan"
"365",2459300,2462000,"You were lookingthrough her window last night.","Flightplan"
"366",2462100,2465400,"I saw you staringinto my daughter's room. Both of them.","Flightplan"
"367",2465500,2467600,"- You are a lunatic.- Where's Julia?","Flightplan"
"368",2467700,2471300,"Hold it. Back up.Have you seen these men before?","Flightplan"
"369",2471400,2473900,"- Yes.- No. She has not.","Flightplan"
"370",2474000,2478700,"I saw them last nightstaring into my daughter's room.","Flightplan"

"372",2482100,2484800,"- I've never seen this woman before.- Nor have I.","Flightplan"
"373",2484900,2487200,"Do you expect them to say,'You got me'?","Flightplan"
"374",2487300,2492500,"- Shouldn't we move this to a galley?- Why? I didn't do anything.","Flightplan"
"375",2492700,2494900,"I've never even seen this woman before.","Flightplan"
"376",2495000,2498300,"- Where'd you take my little girl?- Aren't you listening?","Flightplan"
"377",2498400,2500500,"I have never seen her.","Flightplan"
"378",2508100,2510200,"I don't trust 'em.","Flightplan"
"379",2511900,2514400,"Not that it's any of your concern,","Flightplan"
"380",2514500,2518600,"but I was at the Hilton last nighton business.","Flightplan"
"381",2518700,2522800,"We both were.And neither of us left the hotel.","Flightplan"
"382",2524800,2527500,"Would you like to see our bill?","Flightplan"
"383",2528400,2530800,"It's a bit unorthodox but...","Flightplan"
"384",2532100,2534400,"...if you wouldn't mind.","Flightplan"
"385",2546400,2551700,"When I travel with my children,I have an eye on them at all times.","Flightplan"
"386",2551800,2555400,"I don't lose themand blame somebody else.","Flightplan"
"387",2573700,2577500,"- Satisfied?- A bill doesn't prove anything.","Flightplan"
"388",2578900,2580000,"Satisfied?","Flightplan"
"389",2580100,2584000,"Are you gonna let himtalk to you like that?","Flightplan"
"390",2588600,2590700,"- Let's go.- Where's my daughter?","Flightplan"

"396",2606000,2610600,"Anyone else have any questions for me?","Flightplan"
"397",2615100,2618000,"Then you'll have to finda few other Arabs to harass.","Flightplan"
"398",2618200,2621100,"- Son of a bitch.- We're gonna take our seats now.","Flightplan"
"399",2621200,2624100,"All of us. Right?","Flightplan"

"405",2645100,2647700,"- and stashing her until we land?- Yes.","Flightplan"
"406",2647800,2650100,"Mind if I ask you an obvious question?","Flightplan"
"407",2650200,2653300,"If they knew where you lived,why not take her from there?","Flightplan"
"408",2653400,2656100,"Why take her on an airplanewith no means of escape?","Flightplan"
"409",2656200,2659200,"- I don't know.- And let's not forget,","Flightplan"
"410",2659300,2663500,"her name isn't on the manifest.How could two passengers pull that off?","Flightplan"
"411",2663600,2666500,"They'd have to havesomebody from the crew involved.","Flightplan"
"412",2666600,2668700,"Jesus.","Flightplan"
"413",2669200,2671400,"Think about what you're asking me to do.","Flightplan"
"414",2671500,2676500,"Approach two Arabs on an airplaneand accuse them of criminal conspiracy.","Flightplan"
"415",2676600,2679700,"I don't give a shitabout being politically incorrect.","Flightplan"
"416",2679800,2683800,"Fine, let's arrest them, just as soonas you answer one more question.","Flightplan"
"417",2683900,2687100,"Why would anyonewant to take your daughter?","Flightplan"
"418",2687200,2691800,"What makes her so special?What makes you so special?","Flightplan"
"419",2695200,2700700,"I know the plane.That's what this is all about.","Flightplan"

"421",2704900,2709700,"I think they're hijacking the plane.I think my daughter's a hostage.","Flightplan"
"422",2709800,2713400,"Your husband's death is startingto make a lot more sense to me.","Flightplan"
"423",2713500,2717500,"A couple more hoursand even I'm ready to jump.","Flightplan"
"424",2721200,2723299,"He fell.","Flightplan"
"425",2723300,2725900,"- David fell.- Sure he did.","Flightplan"

"500",3110800,3114000,"We choose to believe something else.","Flightplan"

"507",3145300,3147700,"if we haven't grieved.","Flightplan"
"508",3153000,3156500,"Sometimes it helps to think of an image.","Flightplan"

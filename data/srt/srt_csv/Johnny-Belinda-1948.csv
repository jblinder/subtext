"818",5238913,5240676,"I'm telling you again,I'd sooner not take him...","Johnny Belinda"
"819",5240748,5242511,"than let you turn himinto a thickheaded farmer.","Johnny Belinda"
"820",5242583,5245017,"And I tell you he'll have to earn his keepwhen he's growed.","Johnny Belinda"
"821",5245086,5246519,"What if he gets sick? lt'll cost money.","Johnny Belinda"
"822",5246587,5249055,"Whose money?I don't recall you bringing in any.","Johnny Belinda"
"823",5249156,5251750,"Well, it's ours, ain't it? You're my wife.","Johnny Belinda"

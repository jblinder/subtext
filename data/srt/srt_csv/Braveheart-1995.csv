"690",6149416,6154665,"What advice would you offeron the, er, present... situation?","Braveheart"
"691",6185954,6187953,"I shall offer a truce...","Braveheart"
"692",6189494,6191579,"...and buy him off.","Braveheart"
"693",6193454,6197036,"But who will go to him? Not I.","Braveheart"
"694",6197161,6200493,"If I fell under the sword of that murderer...","Braveheart"
"695",6200535,6203660,"...it might be my head in a basket.","Braveheart"
"696",6204118,6208159,"And not... my gentle son.","Braveheart"
"697",6208284,6212992,"The mere sight of him would only encouragean enemy to take over the whole country.","Braveheart"
"698",6216409,6218491,"So whom do I send?","Braveheart"
"699",6222909,6224116,"Whom do I send?","Braveheart"
"700",6306817,6308817,"I'm dreaming.","Braveheart"
"701",6308942,6311149,"Yes, you are.","Braveheart"
"702",6312316,6314316,"And you must wake.","Braveheart"
"703",6323815,6325940,"I don't want to wake.","Braveheart"
"704",6327397,6329480,"I want to stay here with you.","Braveheart"
"705",6330730,6332814,"And I with you.","Braveheart"
"706",6332855,6334938,"But you must wake now.","Braveheart"
"707",6337604,6340021,"Wake up, William.","Braveheart"
"708",6340104,6341979,"Wake up.","Braveheart"
"709",6344688,6346937,"William, wake up...","Braveheart"
"710",6347395,6350521,"William! A royal entourage comes...","Braveheart"
"711",6350603,6352686,"...flying banners of truce...","Braveheart"
"712",6352770,6355395,"...and the standards of Longshanks himself!","Braveheart"
"713",6398599,6400598,"I am the Princess of Wales.","Braveheart"
"714",6400722,6404182,"I come as the King's servantand with his authority.","Braveheart"
"715",6404348,6406182,"To do what?","Braveheart"
"716",6407306,6409431,"To discuss the King's proposals.","Braveheart"
"717",6411806,6413888,"Will you speak with a woman?","Braveheart"
"718",6433845,6437428,"I understand you have recentlybeen given the rank of knight.","Braveheart"
"719",6437511,6439594,"I have been given nothing.","Braveheart"
"720",6439678,6441761,"God makes men what they are.","Braveheart"
"721",6442719,6445553,"Did God make youthe sacker of peaceful cities?","Braveheart"
"722",6445635,6450260,"The executioner of the King's nephew,my husband's own cousin?","Braveheart"
"723",6450343,6454593,"York was the staging pointfor every invasion of my country.","Braveheart"
"724",6454677,6459467,"That cousin hanged innocent Scots, evenwomen and children, from the city walls.","Braveheart"
"725",6462426,6466551,"Longshanks did far worsethe last time he took a Scottish city.","Braveheart"
"726",6486964,6490673,"You ask your King...to his face. Ask him.","Braveheart"
"727",6493380,6496380,"See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.","Braveheart"
"728",6505046,6507754,"Hamilton... Leave us.","Braveheart"
"729",6509004,6511754,"- My Lady?- Leave us! Now.","Braveheart"
"730",6523460,6525545,"Let us talk plainly.","Braveheart"
"731",6525628,6527710,"You invade England.","Braveheart"
"732",6527794,6532502,"But you cannot complete the conquestso far from your shelter and supply.","Braveheart"
"733",6533002,6535084,"The King desires peace.","Braveheart"
"734",6536043,6538126,"Longshanks desires peace?","Braveheart"
"735",6538209,6540292,"He declares it to me, I swear it.","Braveheart"
"736",6540417,6543375,"He proposes that you withdraw your attack.","Braveheart"
"737",6543417,6547000,"In return he grants you title,estates and this chest of gold...","Braveheart"
"738",6547083,6549125,"...which I am to pay to you personally.","Braveheart"
"739",6550167,6554666,"A lordship and titles, gold...that I should become Judas.","Braveheart"
"740",6554707,6556792,"Peace is made in such ways.","Braveheart"
"741",6556999,6558749,"Slaves are made in such ways!","Braveheart"
"742",6562123,6565415,"The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,I was a boy.","Braveheart"
"743",6565456,6568123,"And many Scottish nobleswho would not be slaves...","Braveheart"
"744",6568248,6571414,"...were lured by him,under a flag of truce, to a barn...","Braveheart"
"745",6571497,6573539,"...where he had them hanged.","Braveheart"
"746",6575123,6577204,"I was very young.","Braveheart"
"747",6577289,6580164,"But I rememberLongshanks's notion of peace.","Braveheart"
"748",6584288,6586704,"I understand you have suffered.","Braveheart"
"749",6587913,6591079,"I know... about your woman.","Braveheart"
"750",6602077,6604119,"She was my wife.","Braveheart"
"751",6606577,6611911,"We married in secret because I wouldnot share her with an English lord.","Braveheart"
"752",6611952,6615618,"They killed her... to get to me.","Braveheart"
"753",6620534,6622618,"I've never spoken of it.","Braveheart"
"754",6624368,6627117,"I don't know why I tell you now, except...","Braveheart"
"755",6629825,6631866,"...I see her strength in you.","Braveheart"
"756",6637865,6639824,"One day...","Braveheart"
"757",6639866,6641908,"...you'll be a queen.","Braveheart"
"758",6642533,6644657,"And you must open your eyes.","Braveheart"
"759",6652448,6654572,"You tell your King...","Braveheart"
"760",6654614,6657489,"...that William Wallace will not be ruled...","Braveheart"
"761",6657531,6660072,"...and nor will any Scot while I live.","Braveheart"
"762",6693402,6697860,"Ah! My son's Ioyal wife returnsunkilled by the heathen.","Braveheart"
"763",6697985,6699985,"So he accepted our bribe?","Braveheart"
"764",6700110,6702192,"No. He did not.","Braveheart"
"765",6703902,6705984,"Then why does he stay?","Braveheart"
"766",6706026,6708901,"My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.","Braveheart"
"767",6708984,6711066,"He waits for you at York.","Braveheart"
"768",6711191,6713483,"He says he will attack no more towns...","Braveheart"
"769",6713566,6716234,"...if you are man enoughto come and face him.","Braveheart"
"770",6716358,6718358,"Did he?","Braveheart"
"771",6719065,6723107,"The Welsh bowmen will not be detected...","Braveheart"
"772",6723274,6727774,"...arriving so far around his flank.","Braveheart"
"773",6728564,6731564,"The main force of our armiesfrom France land here...","Braveheart"
"774",6731606,6733732,"...to the north of Edinburgh.","Braveheart"
"775",6733815,6738148,"Conscripts from Irelandapproach from the southwest...","Braveheart"
"776",6738231,6739814,"...to here.","Braveheart"
"777",6739939,6743480,"Welsh bowmen, troops from France,Irish conscripts.","Braveheart"
"778",6743522,6746313,"But they'd take weeks to assemble.","Braveheart"
"779",6746397,6748479,"I dispatched them...","Braveheart"
"780",6748521,6750772,"...before I sent your wife.","Braveheart"
"781",6754729,6757437,"So our little ruse succeeded.","Braveheart"
"782",6757479,6759561,"Thank you.","Braveheart"
"783",6759686,6763936,"And while this upstartawaits my arrival in York...","Braveheart"
"784",6764020,6767935,"...my forces will have arrivedin Edinburgh, behind him.","Braveheart"
"785",6769144,6772019,"You spoke with this, er...","Braveheart"
"786",6772894,6775727,"...Wallace in private?","Braveheart"
"787",6775810,6778309,"Tell me...","Braveheart"
"788",6779059,6781143,"What kind of man is he?","Braveheart"
"789",6782519,6784559,"A mindless barbarian.","Braveheart"
"790",6786018,6788101,"Not a king like you, my Lord.","Braveheart"
"791",6790642,6793100,"You may return to your embroidery.","Braveheart"
"792",6793183,6795267,"Humbly, my Lord.","Braveheart"
"793",6795349,6798016,"You brought back the money, of course?","Braveheart"
"794",6801891,6806641,"No. I gave it to ease the sufferingof the children of this war.","Braveheart"
"795",6809265,6811556,"That's what happenswhen you send a woman.","Braveheart"
"796",6813515,6818723,"Forgive me, sire. I thought that generositymight demonstrate your greatness...","Braveheart"
"797",6818806,6820889,"...to those you mean to rule.","Braveheart"
"798",6824055,6826138,"My greatness...","Braveheart"
"799",6826304,6830388,"...will be better demonstratedwhen Wallace returns to Scotland...","Braveheart"
"800",6830513,6832929,"...and finds his country in ashes.","Braveheart"
"801",6837679,6839720,"William!","Braveheart"
"802",6839887,6842013,"There's riders approaching.","Braveheart"

"805",6854344,6856551,"Must have made an impression.","Braveheart"
"806",6856635,6858051,"Aye.","Braveheart"
"807",6858093,6860510,"I didn't think you were in the tent that long.","Braveheart"

"812",6899922,6903131,"I don't know about the Welsh yet,but the Irish have landed.","Braveheart"
"813",6903214,6905505,"I had to see it myself to believe it.","Braveheart"
"814",6905546,6908381,"What are the Irish doingfighting with the English?","Braveheart"
"815",6908463,6912255,"I wouldn't worry about them.Didn't I tell you before?","Braveheart"
"816",6912338,6914380,"It's my island.","Braveheart"
"817",6914463,6918670,"Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburghand assemble the council. Order it!","Braveheart"
"818",6918795,6921337,"Right. Come on!","Braveheart"

"821",6928670,6931419,"- We'll have to negotiate.- Please, gentlemen!","Braveheart"
"822",6931461,6933794,"Lords, Craig is right!","Braveheart"
"823",6933878,6936960,"This time our only option is to negotiate.","Braveheart"
"824",6937002,6939669,"Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...","Braveheart"
"825",6946710,6950167,"My army has marchedfor more days than I can remember.","Braveheart"
"826",6950251,6952584,"And we still have preparations to make...","Braveheart"
"827",6952709,6954833,"...so l'll make this plain.","Braveheart"
"828",6955666,6958376,"We require every soldier you can summon...","Braveheart"
"829",6958459,6961333,"...your personal escorts, even yourselves.","Braveheart"
"830",6961416,6963250,"And we need them now.","Braveheart"
"831",6965000,6968707,"With such a force arrayed against us,it's time to discuss other options.","Braveheart"
"832",6968749,6970833,"Other options?!","Braveheart"
"833",6971664,6975249,"don't you wish at leastto lead your men onto the field...","Braveheart"
"834",6975332,6978164,"...and barter a better deal with Longshanks...","Braveheart"
"835",6978206,6980664,"...before you run?- Sir William...","Braveheart"
"836",6980748,6982623,"- We cannot defeat them!- We can!","Braveheart"
"837",6982748,6985163,"- Sir William!- And we will!","Braveheart"

"840",6995247,6998579,"If you'll no stand up with us now,l'd say you're cowards.","Braveheart"
"841",7005371,7006996,"If you are Scotsmen...","Braveheart"
"842",7007079,7009036,"...l'm ashamed to call myself one.","Braveheart"
"843",7009120,7011661,"Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.","Braveheart"
"844",7014078,7015910,"I beg you.","Braveheart"
"845",7019744,7021909,"You've achievedmore than anyone ever dreamed.","Braveheart"
"846",7021951,7025410,"But fighting these odds,it looks like rage, not courage.","Braveheart"
"847",7025494,7027576,"It's well beyond rage.","Braveheart"
"848",7029201,7031076,"Help me.","Braveheart"
"849",7032658,7036867,"In the name of Christ, help yourselves!","Braveheart"

"857",7063864,7066280,"Unite us! Unite the clans!","Braveheart"
"858",7073489,7076446,"- All right!- Right.","Braveheart"
"859",7081070,7083112,"This cannot be the way.","Braveheart"
"860",7083237,7085446,"You said yourself...","Braveheart"
"861",7085570,7089028,"...the nobles will not support Wallace.","Braveheart"
"862",7090403,7094652,"So how does it help usto join the side that is slaughtered?","Braveheart"
"863",7095444,7097527,"I gave him my word.","Braveheart"
"864",7105526,7107610,"I know it is hard.","Braveheart"
"865",7107693,7109776,"Being a leader is.","Braveheart"
"866",7111442,7113525,"My son...","Braveheart"
"867",7113609,7115442,"Son...","Braveheart"
"868",7115484,7117025,"Look at me.","Braveheart"
"869",7124191,7126274,"I cannot be King.","Braveheart"
"870",7126733,7129399,"You and you alone can rule Scotland.","Braveheart"
"871",7129483,7132523,"What I tell you, you must do.","Braveheart"
"872",7132648,7135399,"Not for me, not for yourself...","Braveheart"
"873",7135441,7137523,"...but for your country.","Braveheart"

"882",7194768,7196809,"The archers are ready, sire.","Braveheart"
"883",7196891,7198934,"Not the archers.","Braveheart"
"884",7199017,7202309,"My scouts say their archersare miles away and no threat.","Braveheart"
"885",7202392,7204475,"Arrows cost money.","Braveheart"
"886",7204516,7207558,"Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.","Braveheart"

"896",7446658,7449158,"Mornay? Lochlan?","Braveheart"
"897",7449367,7452283,"I gave Mornaydouble his lands in Scotland...","Braveheart"
"898",7452366,7454366,"...and matching estates in England.","Braveheart"

"223",814062,816731,"- wasn't it?- That's right. Almost Ł100.","Dial M for Murder"
"224",817024,820568,"I'd left it in a cashbox in my studyand in the morning it had gone.","Dial M for Murder"
"225",820736,822196,"It was the college porter, of course.","Dial M for Murder"

"240",855687,857523,"My wife has some money of her own.","Dial M for Murder"

"243",863779,866615,"You know, people with capitaldon't realize how lucky they are.","Dial M for Murder"
"244",866783,868866,"I'm almost resigned to livingon what I can earn.","Dial M for Murder"
"245",869034,870786,"Well, you can always marry for money.","Dial M for Murder"
"246",870953,872913,"I suppose some peoplemake a business out of that.","Dial M for Murder"

"248",876292,877668,"Well, I was a tennis star.","Dial M for Murder"
"249",877835,880754,"You've given up tennis.She hasn't left you.","Dial M for Murder"
"250",881297,882505,"She nearly did.","Dial M for Murder"

"252",884801,886509,"in championships and took Margot with me.","Dial M for Murder"

"254",889013,892682,"she tried to make me give up tennisand play husband instead.","Dial M for Murder"
"255",892850,894268,"In the end, we compromised.","Dial M for Murder"
"256",894434,896727,"I went alone to Americafor the grass-court season...","Dial M for Murder"
"257",896895,899730,"and returned after the national championships.","Dial M for Murder"
"258",899899,903067,"I soon realized that a lot had happenedwhile I was away.","Dial M for Murder"
"259",903235,905988,"For one thing,she wasn't in love with me anymore.","Dial M for Murder"
"260",906154,910075,"There were phone calls which would end abruptlyif I happened to walk in.","Dial M for Murder"
"261",910243,913953,"There was an old school friendused to visit from time to time.","Dial M for Murder"
"262",914413,918082,"One day we had a row. I wanted to playin the covered-court tournament...","Dial M for Murder"
"263",918250,920793,"and as usual, she didn't want me to go.","Dial M for Murder"
"264",921421,926258,"I was in the bedroom. The phone rang.It all sounded pretty urgent.","Dial M for Murder"
"265",926426,929177,"After that, she seemed keenthat I play in the tournament after all.","Dial M for Murder"
"266",929345,932221,"So I packed my kit into the car and drove off.","Dial M for Murder"
"267",932849,937727,"I parked the car two streets away,walked back in my tracks.","Dial M for Murder"
"268",938062,941398,"Ten minutes later,she came out of this house and took a taxi.","Dial M for Murder"
"269",941566,943232,"I took another.","Dial M for Murder"
"270",943900,946445,"Her old school friend livedin a studio in Chelsea.","Dial M for Murder"
"271",946613,948363,"I could see them through the studio window...","Dial M for Murder"

"273",951033,954702,"They didn't say much.They just looked very natural together.","Dial M for Murder"
"274",955038,958248,"You know, it's funny how you can tellwhen people are in love.","Dial M for Murder"
"275",959292,961000,"I went for a walk.","Dial M for Murder"
"276",961461,964629,"I began to wonder what would happenif she left me.","Dial M for Murder"
"277",964797,967966,"I'd have to find some wayof earning a living to begin with.","Dial M for Murder"
"278",968216,971761,"I suddenly realized how much I'd grownto depend on her.","Dial M for Murder"
"279",971928,975349,"All these expensive tastes I'd acquiredwhile I was at the top.","Dial M for Murder"
"280",975515,979394,"And now big tennis had finished with me,and so apparently had my wife.","Dial M for Murder"
"281",979562,982397,"I can't ever remember being so scared.","Dial M for Murder"
"282",982565,985524,"I dropped into a puband had a couple of drinks.","Dial M for Murder"
"283",985692,990197,"As I sat in the corner,I thought of all sorts of things.","Dial M for Murder"
"284",990365,992658,"I thought of three different ways of killing him.","Dial M for Murder"
"285",993158,994993,"I even thought of killing her.","Dial M for Murder"
"286",995452,997913,"That seemed a far more sensible idea.","Dial M for Murder"
"287",998081,1001207,"And just as I was working out how I could do it,I suddenly saw something...","Dial M for Murder"
"288",1001375,1004378,"which completely changed my mind.","Dial M for Murder"
"289",1007673,1010341,"I didn't go to that tournament after all.","Dial M for Murder"
"290",1010509,1014136,"When I got back, she was sittingexactly where you are now.","Dial M for Murder"
"291",1014304,1018265,"And I told her I decided to give up tennisand look after her instead.","Dial M for Murder"
"292",1019476,1020519,"Well?","Dial M for Murder"
"293",1020687,1023730,"Well, as things turned out,I needn't have got so worked up after all.","Dial M for Murder"
"294",1023898,1027692,"Apparently that spaghetti eveninghad been a sort of a fond farewell.","Dial M for Murder"
"295",1027859,1030069,"The boyfriend had been calledback to New York.","Dial M for Murder"
"296",1030238,1031445,"- Ah, an American?- Yes.","Dial M for Murder"
"297",1031864,1033490,"There were long letters from there.","Dial M for Murder"
"298",1033657,1037743,"They usually arrived on Thursdays.And she burned them all except one.","Dial M for Murder"
"299",1037912,1040497,"That one she used to transferfrom handbag to handbag.","Dial M for Murder"
"300",1040664,1042499,"It was always with her.","Dial M for Murder"
"301",1042666,1046670,"That letter became an obsession with me.I had to find out what was in it.","Dial M for Murder"
"302",1046837,1048755,"And finally I did.","Dial M for Murder"
"303",1049006,1050632,"That letter made very interesting reading.","Dial M for Murder"
"304",1051425,1053634,"- Do you mean you stole it?- Yes.","Dial M for Murder"
"305",1053802,1056680,"I even wrote her two anonymous notesoffering to sell it back.","Dial M for Murder"
"306",1056847,1057931,"Why?","Dial M for Murder"
"307",1058098,1061143,"I was hoping it would make her comeand tell me all about him...","Dial M for Murder"
"308",1061309,1062184,"but it didn't.","Dial M for Murder"
"309",1062936,1064980,"So I kept the letter.","Dial M for Murder"
"310",1067650,1069067,"Why are you telling me all this?","Dial M for Murder"
"311",1069736,1071778,"Because you're the only personI can trust.","Dial M for Murder"
"312",1076491,1079744,"Anyway, that did it.It must have put the fear of God into them...","Dial M for Murder"
"313",1079912,1081288,"because the letters stopped...","Dial M for Murder"
"314",1081455,1083664,"and we lived happily ever after.","Dial M for Murder"
"315",1084166,1086542,"It was funny to thinkthat just a year ago...","Dial M for Murder"
"316",1086711,1090255,"I sat in that Knightsbridge pubactually planning to murder her.","Dial M for Murder"
"317",1090673,1092423,"And I might have done it...","Dial M for Murder"
"318",1092592,1095844,"if I hadn't seen somethingthat changed my mind.","Dial M for Murder"
"319",1096011,1098221,"Well? What did you see?","Dial M for Murder"
"320",1099390,1100807,"I saw you.","Dial M for Murder"
"321",1105771,1107355,"What was so odd about that?","Dial M for Murder"
"322",1107522,1108690,"The coincidence.","Dial M for Murder"
"323",1108857,1111108,"Only a week before,I'd been to a reunion dinner...","Dial M for Murder"
"324",1111277,1113194,"and the fellas were talking about you.","Dial M for Murder"
"325",1113362,1116740,"How you'd been court-martialedduring the war, a year in prison.","Dial M for Murder"
"326",1116907,1118115,"That was news.","Dial M for Murder"
"327",1118284,1121661,"Mind you, at college, we'd all saidthat old Swann would end up in jail.","Dial M for Murder"
"328",1121828,1123954,"That cashbox, I suppose.","Dial M for Murder"
"329",1124123,1125207,"Well, what about it?","Dial M for Murder"
"330",1125665,1129044,"Oh, my dear fellow,everybody knew you took that money.","Dial M for Murder"

"336",1148146,1149689,"Yes, I think you'd better.","Dial M for Murder"
"337",1149856,1152400,"It was when I saw you in that pubthat it happened.","Dial M for Murder"
"338",1152609,1154693,"Suddenly everything became quite clear.","Dial M for Murder"
"339",1156948,1159281,"Only a few months before,Margot and I had made our wills...","Dial M for Murder"
"340",1159450,1160450,"quite short affairs...","Dial M for Murder"

"343",1168041,1169750,"All a little too easy to get at.","Dial M for Murder"
"344",1169919,1173171,"And that was dangerousas they'd be bound to suspect me.","Dial M for Murder"
"345",1173923,1177259,"I needed an alibi, a very good one.","Dial M for Murder"
"346",1177509,1179385,"Then I saw you.","Dial M for Murder"
"347",1179554,1182305,"I often wondered what happened to peoplewhen they came out of prison.","Dial M for Murder"
"348",1182472,1185851,"People like you, I mean.Can they get jobs?","Dial M for Murder"
"349",1186018,1191230,"Do old friends rally round?Suppose they'd never had any friends.","Dial M for Murder"
"350",1191398,1194442,"I became so curious to knowthat I followed you.","Dial M for Murder"

"355",1205788,1208455,"I was hoping that sooner or laterI might catch you at something...","Dial M for Murder"
"356",1208624,1209958,"and be able to, uh....","Dial M for Murder"
"357",1210125,1213002,"- Blackmail me?- Influence you.","Dial M for Murder"
"358",1213170,1215630,"After a couple of weeks,I got to know your routine...","Dial M for Murder"
"359",1215798,1217257,"and that made it a lot easier.","Dial M for Murder"
"360",1217424,1220093,"- Rather dour work.- To begin with, yes.","Dial M for Murder"
"361",1220260,1222304,"But you know how it is.You take up a hobby...","Dial M for Murder"
"362",1222471,1225347,"and the more you get to know it,the more fascinating it becomes.","Dial M for Murder"
"363",1225516,1227308,"You became quite fascinating.","Dial M for Murder"
"364",1227476,1231354,"In fact, there were times when I feltthat you almost belonged to me.","Dial M for Murder"

"366",1233441,1236108,"You used to go to the dog racingMondays and Thursdays.","Dial M for Murder"
"367",1236277,1238737,"I even took it up myself,just to be near you.","Dial M for Murder"
"368",1239822,1241906,"You'd changed your name to Adams.","Dial M for Murder"

"372",1249707,1251916,"I got quite discouraged.","Dial M for Murder"
"373",1252084,1254711,"Then one day,you disappeared from your lodgings.","Dial M for Murder"
"374",1254878,1258673,"I phoned your landlady.I said Mr. Adams owed me Ł5.","Dial M for Murder"
"375",1258840,1260090,"But apparently that was nothing.","Dial M for Murder"

"377",1265263,1267766,"And Mr. Adams had beensuch a nice gentleman.","Dial M for Murder"

"379",1270185,1273395,"Yes. That always seems to upset them most.","Dial M for Murder"
"380",1273564,1275606,"I say, old boy,if you want another drink...","Dial M for Murder"
"381",1275775,1277901,"do you mind putting on these gloves?","Dial M for Murder"

"397",1324198,1327075,"The only trouble is,she does rather enjoy being courted...","Dial M for Murder"
"398",1327242,1328910,"and she's so very expensive.","Dial M for Murder"
"399",1329452,1332955,"Perhaps that's why you've been tryingto sell her car for over a month.","Dial M for Murder"

"831",3293916,3296501,"Oh, look, before I forget,the sergeant wanted to know...","Dial M for Murder"
"832",3296668,3298503,"why you didn't phone the police immediately.","Dial M for Murder"
"833",3298670,3301088,"- How could I? You were on the phone.- I know, but--","Dial M for Murder"
"834",3301255,3303882,"You distinctly told menot to speak to anyone until you got here.","Dial M for Murder"
"835",3304050,3307302,"I know, darling, but I told hima slightly different story.","Dial M for Murder"
"836",3307471,3308262,"Why?","Dial M for Murder"
"837",3308429,3311014,"Well, I said you didn't phone the policebecause you assumed...","Dial M for Murder"
"838",3311182,3313059,"that I would do it from the hotel.","Dial M for Murder"
"839",3313226,3314559,"Why did you say that?","Dial M for Murder"
"840",3314728,3317981,"Because it was the perfectly logical explanation,and he accepted it.","Dial M for Murder"
"841",3318148,3321483,"Now, if they get the ideathat we delayed reporting it...","Dial M for Murder"
"842",3321652,3324237,"they might get nosyand start asking all sorts of questions--","Dial M for Murder"
"843",3324405,3326043,"So you want me to say the same thing?","Dial M for Murder"
"844",3326045,3328157,"I think so, dear, in case it comes up again.","Dial M for Murder"

"854",3380335,3382670,"in charge of criminal investigationof this division.","Dial M for Murder"
"855",3382838,3385172,"We gave your sergeantall the necessary information.","Dial M for Murder"
"856",3385340,3387050,"Yes. I've seen his report, of course...","Dial M for Murder"
"857",3387217,3391012,"but there are a few thingsI'd like to get firsthand.","Dial M for Murder"
"858",3391346,3395016,"I gather the sergeant only saw youfor a few moments, Mrs. Wendice?","Dial M for Murder"
"859",3395184,3396224,"Yes, I--","Dial M for Murder"
"860",3396393,3398393,"My wife was suffering from considerable shock.","Dial M for Murder"

"862",3401356,3402898,"Do you mind if I take a look around?","Dial M for Murder"
"863",3403067,3405693,"Go ahead. The bedroom and bathroomare through here.","Dial M for Murder"
"864",3418664,3421041,"He certainly didn't get in by the bathroom.","Dial M for Murder"
"865",3426005,3428548,"And the kitchen has bars on the window.","Dial M for Murder"
"866",3433679,3436556,"We assume he must have come inthrough these windows here.","Dial M for Murder"
"867",3436724,3439268,"I, uh-- I understand you weren't herewhen this happened.","Dial M for Murder"
"868",3439436,3441938,"No, I was at a dinner partyat the Grendon Hotel.","Dial M for Murder"
"869",3442106,3443356,"And by a curious coincidence...","Dial M for Murder"
"870",3443523,3445690,"I was actually phoning my wifewhen she was attacked.","Dial M for Murder"
"871",3445858,3448902,"So I gather. Can you tell meexactly what time it was, sir?","Dial M for Murder"
"872",3449070,3453074,"No, I'm afraid I can't.I do remember my watch had stopped.","Dial M for Murder"

"874",3459164,3460039,"No, I didn't.","Dial M for Murder"

"877",3466630,3468505,"Have you any idea who he was?","Dial M for Murder"
"878",3469423,3473385,"Hmm? Oh, yes. At least,we've discovered where he lived.","Dial M for Murder"
"879",3473554,3476681,"There still seems to be some confusionas to his real name.","Dial M for Murder"
"880",3476849,3478682,"- Oh?- He appeared to have several.","Dial M for Murder"
"881",3480184,3483603,"- Had you ever seen him before?- Why, no, of course not.","Dial M for Murder"

"886",3495367,3497367,"No. You see, he attacked me from behind...","Dial M for Murder"
"887",3497536,3500454,"and it was dark.I hardly saw him at all.","Dial M for Murder"
"888",3500621,3504250,"But before I showed you these photographs,you said you'd never seen him...","Dial M for Murder"
"889",3504418,3505168,"before.","Dial M for Murder"
"890",3505335,3508628,"How could you know thatif you never saw his face last night?","Dial M for Murder"
"891",3508797,3510088,"I don't quite understand.","Dial M for Murder"
"892",3510257,3512842,"Inspector, my wife simply meansthat as far as she knew...","Dial M for Murder"
"893",3513010,3514885,"she never saw him before.","Dial M for Murder"
"894",3515052,3516762,"- Was that what you meant?- Yes.","Dial M for Murder"

"898",3526063,3527565,"- At least....- Yes?","Dial M for Murder"
"899",3527900,3530193,"It's very like someoneI was at college with.","Dial M for Murder"
"900",3530360,3532152,"But the mustache makes quite a difference.","Dial M for Murder"
"901",3532403,3533737,"Oh? What was his name?","Dial M for Murder"
"902",3533905,3536699,"Oh, I don't know.It must be 20 years since I left.","Dial M for Murder"

"910",3558972,3561724,"- Why, it's unbelievable.- Did you know him well?","Dial M for Murder"
"911",3561891,3563266,"No. He was senior to me.","Dial M for Murder"
"912",3563434,3565393,"- Have you met him since then?- No.","Dial M for Murder"
"913",3565561,3567103,"At least....","Dial M for Murder"

"915",3570525,3573610,"- Oh? When was that?- Six months ago at a railway station.","Dial M for Murder"
"916",3573778,3574945,"Victoria, I think.","Dial M for Murder"

"930",3625079,3626998,"But I always answer the phone from here.","Dial M for Murder"
"931",3627164,3628416,"But why?","Dial M for Murder"
"932",3628583,3632545,"In case I have to write anything down.I can hold the phone in my left hand.","Dial M for Murder"
"933",3634715,3637300,"I see. I'm sorry. Go on.","Dial M for Murder"
"934",3637467,3638884,"When I picked up the phone...","Dial M for Murder"
"935",3639469,3642387,"he must have come from behind those curtainsand attacked me.","Dial M for Murder"
"936",3642556,3645391,"- He got something around my neck.- What do you mean by ""something""?","Dial M for Murder"
"937",3646184,3647601,"I think it was a stocking.","Dial M for Murder"
"938",3647768,3650146,"I see. And what happened then?","Dial M for Murder"
"939",3650313,3653190,"Well, then he pushed me across the desk.","Dial M for Murder"
"940",3653358,3655192,"I distinctly remember feeling for the scissors.","Dial M for Murder"
"941",3655360,3657360,"Where were those scissors usually kept?","Dial M for Murder"
"942",3657528,3660822,"In that mending basket.I'd forgotten to put them away.","Dial M for Murder"
"943",3661074,3664242,"Now, what makes you thinkhe came from behind those curtains?","Dial M for Murder"
"944",3664411,3665869,"Where else could he have been?","Dial M for Murder"
"945",3666038,3667204,"- The curtains were drawn?- Yes.","Dial M for Murder"
"946",3667371,3668621,"Did you draw them yourself?","Dial M for Murder"

"950",3675213,3677882,"Oh, perfectly sure. I always lock upwhen I draw the curtains.","Dial M for Murder"
"951",3678050,3680800,"- Then how do you suppose he got in?- We assume that he broke in.","Dial M for Murder"
"952",3680969,3682510,"Well, there's no sign of a break-in.","Dial M for Murder"

"955",3687851,3689184,"why didn't you call the police...","Dial M for Murder"
"956",3689353,3691061,"immediately this happened?","Dial M for Murder"
"957",3695067,3696858,"I was trying to get through to the police...","Dial M for Murder"
"958",3697027,3699235,"when I discovered my husbandwas on the line.","Dial M for Murder"
"959",3699570,3702072,"I naturally thought he would call the policefrom the hotel...","Dial M for Murder"
"960",3702239,3704032,"before he came here.","Dial M for Murder"
"961",3704201,3707327,"Uh, didn't it occur to youto call a doctor?","Dial M for Murder"
"962",3707496,3709413,"- No.- Why ever not?","Dial M for Murder"
"963",3709956,3712833,"- He was dead.- How did you know that?","Dial M for Murder"

"965",3715295,3718172,"- Did you feel his pulse?- No, of course I didn't.","Dial M for Murder"
"966",3718340,3722009,"Anyone would have realized he was dead.Just one look at those staring eyes--","Dial M for Murder"
"967",3722177,3724135,"Oh, so you did see his face, after all.","Dial M for Murder"
"968",3724304,3727514,"I saw his eyes!I can't remember his face!","Dial M for Murder"
"969",3727766,3730601,"Inspector, my wife obviouslyhad never seen this man before.","Dial M for Murder"
"970",3730768,3732978,"If he didn't come in by those windows,how did he get in?","Dial M for Murder"
"971",3735648,3739318,"As a matter of fact, we're quite certainthat he came in by this door.","Dial M for Murder"
"972",3740152,3741862,"But it was locked.","Dial M for Murder"
"973",3742030,3744949,"Margot, did you open that doorat all after we'd gone?","Dial M for Murder"
"974",3745117,3745865,"No.","Dial M for Murder"

"979",3755960,3757293,"Do you employ a charwoman?","Dial M for Murder"

"981",3760798,3762507,"What makes you think he came in this way?","Dial M for Murder"
"982",3764510,3765302,"His shoes.","Dial M for Murder"
"983",3765469,3766512,"His shoes?","Dial M for Murder"
"984",3767972,3769974,"The ground was soaking wet last night.","Dial M for Murder"
"985",3770141,3773686,"And if he'd come in by the garden,he'd have left mud all over the carpet.","Dial M for Murder"
"986",3773853,3775813,"As it is, he didn't leaveany marks at all...","Dial M for Murder"
"987",3775981,3778315,"because he wiped his shoeson the front doormat.","Dial M for Murder"
"988",3778567,3779358,"How can you tell?","Dial M for Murder"
"989",3779525,3782945,"It's a fairly new matand some of its fibers came off on his shoes.","Dial M for Murder"
"990",3783112,3783778,"Oh, but surely--","Dial M for Murder"
"991",3783947,3788159,"And there was a small tar stain on the mat,and some of the fibers show that as well.","Dial M for Murder"
"992",3788326,3789784,"No, there's no question about it.","Dial M for Murder"
"993",3791746,3794998,"Wait a minute. I think I've got it.","Dial M for Murder"

"1008",3824237,3826739,"Your latchkey was in your handbagwhen you lost it?","Dial M for Murder"

"1014",3839293,3840753,"When did you lose the bag?","Dial M for Murder"

"1019",3852181,3853766,"I don't remember.","Dial M for Murder"
"1020",3853934,3855851,"That's how he got in.He had a duplicate made...","Dial M for Murder"
"1021",3856018,3859103,"- and returned the original to the bag.- Before you go any further...","Dial M for Murder"
"1022",3859396,3861648,"how did he get inthrough the street door?","Dial M for Murder"
"1023",3861815,3863525,"Well, the street door is never locked.","Dial M for Murder"
"1024",3863693,3865235,"I see.","Dial M for Murder"
"1025",3865402,3868155,"He could have had your key copied...","Dial M for Murder"
"1026",3868322,3871492,"and he could have used itto open the door...","Dial M for Murder"
"1027",3872702,3874827,"but of course he didn't.","Dial M for Murder"
"1028",3875454,3876121,"Why not?","Dial M for Murder"
"1029",3876289,3877121,"Because if he had...","Dial M for Murder"
"1030",3877289,3879500,"the key would still have been on himwhen he died.","Dial M for Murder"
"1031",3879668,3881501,"No key was found when we wentthrough his pockets.","Dial M for Murder"
"1032",3886048,3888132,"We seem to be back just where we started,don't we?","Dial M for Murder"
"1033",3889344,3890469,"Well, not quite.","Dial M for Murder"

"1131",4164452,4167496,"Now, you suggest that this mancame to burgle your flat...","Dial M for Murder"
"1132",4167704,4169081,"but there's no evidence of that.","Dial M for Murder"

"1145",4199153,4201320,"How do you thinkI got these bruises on my throat?","Dial M for Murder"

"1203",4469756,4472716,"I've been trying to figure out something for weeksin case it came to this.","Dial M for Murder"

"1207",4483436,4484645,"and the jury believed him.","Dial M for Murder"
"1208",4484814,4487606,"But what did his case really amount to?Just three things:","Dial M for Murder"
"1209",4487774,4490234,"My letter, her stocking...","Dial M for Murder"
"1210",4490403,4492737,"and the fact that becauseno key was found on Swann...","Dial M for Murder"

"1221",4522518,4523810,"Okay.","Dial M for Murder"
"1222",4524604,4526354,"He must have opened it somehow.","Dial M for Murder"
"1223",4527148,4530567,"Suppose you tell the policethat you left your key out here somewhere.","Dial M for Murder"
"1224",4531735,4534112,"Then Swann could have let himself in.","Dial M for Murder"
"1225",4534279,4537239,"- How'd he know it was there?- You told him.","Dial M for Murder"
"1226",4537408,4539117,"But I haven't met Swann in 20 years.","Dial M for Murder"

"1228",4544582,4546041,"You can tell any story about him now.","Dial M for Murder"
"1229",4546208,4548460,"You can even saythat you two met somewhere...","Dial M for Murder"
"1230",4548627,4550837,"and you planned this whole thing together.","Dial M for Murder"
"1231",4551005,4552087,"Planned what?","Dial M for Murder"
"1232",4553048,4555466,"Are you suggesting I arranged for Swannto come here...","Dial M for Murder"
"1233",4555635,4556717,"to blackmail her?","Dial M for Murder"
"1234",4556886,4558261,"No.","Dial M for Murder"
"1235",4558845,4560471,"To kill her.","Dial M for Murder"
"1236",4561265,4563975,"- Kill Margot?- That's it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1237",4564143,4564809,"Why?","Dial M for Murder"
"1238",4564976,4566770,"Because she said so.","Dial M for Murder"
"1239",4568230,4571274,"""He came from behind the curtain...","Dial M for Murder"
"1240",4571442,4574903,"and he tried to strangle me.""Okay, that's what he did.","Dial M for Murder"
"1241",4575070,4576988,"All you gotta do issupport everything she said.","Dial M for Murder"
"1242",4577155,4578823,"Don't you see? That's my whole idea.","Dial M for Murder"
"1243",4578990,4580449,"What about your letter?","Dial M for Murder"
"1244",4580618,4583286,"A man doesn't kill the person he's blackmailing.Doesn't make sense.","Dial M for Murder"
"1245",4583453,4587457,"Yes, I know. That worried me for a while too,but I've got that licked.","Dial M for Murder"
"1246",4587625,4588332,"You tell them...","Dial M for Murder"
"1247",4588917,4591543,"that you stole her handbag yourself.","Dial M for Murder"
"1248",4591712,4592671,"Why should I do that?","Dial M for Murder"
"1249",4594756,4596841,"Because you wanted to read my letter.","Dial M for Murder"
"1250",4597009,4599719,"When you had read it, you got madand decided to teach her a lesson.","Dial M for Murder"
"1251",4599886,4601470,"So you wrote those blackmail notes.","Dial M for Murder"
"1252",4601680,4603055,"Nobody can prove you didn't.","Dial M for Murder"
"1253",4603224,4606309,"You can also say you never saw Swannat Victoria Station.","Dial M for Murder"
"1254",4606476,4609270,"You just invented thatto try to connect him with my letter.","Dial M for Murder"
"1255",4609438,4611105,"Don't you see how it all hangs together?","Dial M for Murder"
"1256",4611274,4613942,"But your letter was found in his pocket.","Dial M for Murder"
"1257",4614109,4616360,"- Well, you put it there.- When?","Dial M for Murder"
"1258",4617113,4618988,"Sometime before the police arrived.","Dial M for Murder"
"1259",4621617,4623659,"And you could have also...","Dial M for Murder"
"1260",4625203,4626246,"planted the stockings...","Dial M for Murder"
"1261",4626413,4627204,"at the same time.","Dial M for Murder"
"1262",4627372,4629541,"But, Mark, why should I want anyoneto kill Margot?","Dial M for Murder"
"1263",4630208,4631710,"I know, Tony.","Dial M for Murder"
"1264",4631877,4635337,"It's tough for us to seebecause we both love her...","Dial M for Murder"
"1265",4636923,4638091,"but we need a reason now.","Dial M for Murder"
"1266",4638591,4640092,"We need it badly.","Dial M for Murder"
"1267",4643346,4646474,"Let's take one of the old stock motives.Had Margot made a will?","Dial M for Murder"
"1268",4647350,4650020,"- Yes, I believe she had.- Who was the beneficiary?","Dial M for Murder"
"1269",4650186,4651479,"Why, I am, I suppose.","Dial M for Murder"
"1270",4651646,4652730,"There's your reason, Tony.","Dial M for Murder"
"1271",4652898,4655274,"Thousands of husbands and wivesleave money to each other...","Dial M for Murder"
"1272",4655443,4658110,"without murdering each other.The police wouldn't believe it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1273",4658279,4659695,"They'd take it for what it is:","Dial M for Murder"
"1274",4659863,4662364,"A man trying desperatelyto save his wife.","Dial M for Murder"
"1275",4662533,4664868,"Well, I certainly thinkit's worth that try.","Dial M for Murder"
"1276",4665036,4668037,"Let's face it. They can't hang youfor a murder that never came off.","Dial M for Murder"
"1277",4668204,4669747,"You'd get a few years in prison.","Dial M for Murder"
"1278",4670791,4672625,"Thanks very much.","Dial M for Murder"
"1279",4673043,4675252,"It's a small price to pay.You'd be saving her life.","Dial M for Murder"
"1280",4675503,4677881,"That's fine coming from you, Mark.","Dial M for Murder"
"1281",4678048,4680884,"Her life wouldn't be in danger at allif it hadn't been for you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1282",4681969,4685637,"It's because of her association with youthat she lost the sympathy of the jury.","Dial M for Murder"
"1283",4687807,4689434,"Don't get me wrong, Mark.","Dial M for Murder"
"1284",4689601,4692228,"If there was the slightest chanceof this coming off, I'd do it...","Dial M for Murder"
"1285",4693146,4694898,"but it's got to be convincing.","Dial M for Murder"
"1286",4695065,4698234,"For instance, how could I possibly havepersuaded Swann to do a thing like this?","Dial M for Murder"
"1287",4698944,4700110,"Well, you offered him money...","Dial M for Murder"
"1288",4700279,4702113,"- or something.- Money? I don't have any.","Dial M for Murder"
"1289",4702280,4703573,"Yes, you'd have had Margot's.","Dial M for Murder"
"1290",4703740,4706326,"It'd be months beforeI get my hands on that...","Dial M for Murder"
"1291",4706493,4708912,"and people don't commit murder on credit.","Dial M for Murder"
"1292",4709788,4710788,"No, I'm....","Dial M for Murder"
"1293",4711332,4714125,"I'm afraid you'll have to thinkof something better than that.","Dial M for Murder"
"1294",4715502,4716877,"I know you're trying to help...","Dial M for Murder"
"1295",4717712,4719963,"but can you imagine anyonebelieving a story like that?","Dial M for Murder"
"1296",4720591,4723134,"Yes, I can, if you make them believe it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1297",4723844,4726011,"I wouldn't know what to say.You'd have to come with me.","Dial M for Murder"
"1298",4726180,4727514,"Tony, that'd really be a mistake.","Dial M for Murder"
"1299",4727680,4730809,"They know the kind of stuff I write.We wouldn't stand a chance there--","Dial M for Murder"
"1300",4740360,4741444,"Oh, hello, inspector.","Dial M for Murder"
"1301",4748327,4750161,"Is it about my wife?","Dial M for Murder"
"1302",4750829,4753747,"- No, sir, I'm afraid not.- Then what is it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1303",4753916,4757210,"Well, I'm making inquiriesin connection with a robbery...","Dial M for Murder"
"1304",4757377,4759546,"that took placeabout three weeks ago, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1305",4759712,4761672,"Well, can't it wait a few days?","Dial M for Murder"
"1306",4761841,4764716,"Of course, sir.I'm very conscious of your position.","Dial M for Murder"
"1307",4764885,4767345,"If I may, I'd like to sayhow deeply sorry I am--","Dial M for Murder"
"1308",4767512,4770265,"Yes, inspector, yes, all right.Now, how can I help you?","Dial M for Murder"
"1309",4770557,4772850,"The cashier of a factory in Ledbury Street...","Dial M for Murder"
"1310",4773018,4774310,"was attacked in his office...","Dial M for Murder"
"1311",4774478,4776979,"and two men made offwith several hundred pounds...","Dial M for Murder"
"1312",4777148,4778730,"mostly in pound notes.","Dial M for Murder"
"1313",4778899,4780315,"What is all this to do with me?","Dial M for Murder"
"1314",4780484,4783528,"Well, in cases like this,all police divisions are asked to keep a lookout...","Dial M for Murder"
"1315",4783695,4785904,"for anyone spending large sums of money.","Dial M for Murder"
"1316",4786073,4787073,"I see.","Dial M for Murder"
"1317",4787240,4792036,"And I was wonderingif you'd sold anything recently for cash.","Dial M for Murder"
"1318",4792203,4792871,"Why?","Dial M for Murder"
"1319",4793663,4797876,"Well, my sergeant happened to be making inquiriesat Wales' Garage the other day...","Dial M for Murder"
"1320",4798042,4802005,"and it appears thatyou settled an account there recently...","Dial M for Murder"
"1321",4803131,4804631,"for just over Ł60.","Dial M for Murder"
"1322",4804800,4806967,"Yes, I happened to havequite a bit on me at the time...","Dial M for Murder"
"1323",4807136,4808427,"so I settled for cash.","Dial M for Murder"
"1324",4808887,4809804,"I see.","Dial M for Murder"
"1325",4809971,4812055,"Had you just drawn this moneyfrom your bank?","Dial M for Murder"
"1326",4813057,4814600,"Have you been to my bank, inspector?","Dial M for Murder"
"1327",4815351,4818770,"Yes. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have, yeah.Yeah, but they wouldn't help me.","Dial M for Murder"
"1328",4818939,4821399,"Oh, bank statements are always jealously guarded.","Dial M for Murder"
"1329",4821859,4824527,"Yes, but I'm rather surprisedyou didn't come to me first.","Dial M for Murder"
"1330",4824694,4829073,"It was only a routine matter after all.I didn't want to disturb you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1331",4831534,4832702,"Where did you get it, sir?","Dial M for Murder"
"1332",4833328,4834662,"Is that any of your business?","Dial M for Murder"
"1333",4834829,4837748,"Well, if it was stolen money,yes, sir, it is my business.","Dial M for Murder"
"1334",4837917,4840292,"- Do you mind if I smoke?- Go ahead.","Dial M for Murder"
"1335",4840627,4842962,"Do you really thinkI've been receiving stolen money?","Dial M for Murder"
"1336",4843130,4845131,"Well, until you tell mewhere you got it...","Dial M for Murder"
"1337",4845298,4847550,"I shan't know what to think, shall I?You see...","Dial M for Murder"
"1338",4847717,4849969,"if you got this moneyfrom someone you didn't know...","Dial M for Murder"
"1339",4850804,4853555,"I mean, that might bethe very person we're looking for.","Dial M for Murder"
"1340",4854475,4855225,"Hello.","Dial M for Murder"
"1341",4857520,4858936,"- Is this yours, sir?- What is it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1342",4859104,4860188,"Somebody's latchkey.","Dial M for Murder"
"1343",4860355,4862148,"It was lying on the floor just here.","Dial M for Murder"
"1344",4865610,4867654,"No. Mine's here.","Dial M for Murder"
"1345",4872909,4876537,"No. No, it's not yours.It may be mine then.","Dial M for Murder"
"1346",4880376,4883670,"Yes. Yes, it is mine.Yes, it must have dropped out of the pocket.","Dial M for Murder"
"1347",4883837,4885587,"There's a small hole there.","Dial M for Murder"
"1348",4885756,4889341,"That's the trouble with these latchkeys,they're all alike.","Dial M for Murder"
"1349",4889510,4890635,"I'm sorry, you were saying?","Dial M for Murder"
"1350",4890802,4893720,"- I don't think I was, was I?- Oh, yes, about that money.","Dial M for Murder"
"1351",4893889,4896015,"I'd be grateful if you'd tell mewhere you got it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1352",4896182,4898935,"After all, Ł100 is quite a lotto carry around.","Dial M for Murder"
"1353",4899103,4902689,"- You said 60 a moment ago.- Did I? Oh, yes.","Dial M for Murder"
"1354",4902855,4907277,"Yes, my sergeant decided to dig a little deeperbefore he put in his report.","Dial M for Murder"
"1355",4907610,4910238,"He said that you also paid a billat your tailor's...","Dial M for Murder"
"1356",4910405,4912114,"and another for wines and spirits.","Dial M for Murder"
"1357",4912283,4913992,"I'm sorry he went to all that trouble.","Dial M for Murder"
"1358",4914158,4916034,"Had he come to me,I could've explained at once.","Dial M for Murder"
"1359",4916203,4919247,"I simply won rather a large sumat dog racing.","Dial M for Murder"
"1360",4919414,4920372,"Over Ł100?","Dial M for Murder"
"1361",4920541,4923417,"Yes, over Ł100.It has been done before, you know.","Dial M for Murder"
"1362",4923586,4926421,"Yes, well, why didn't youtell me this straightaway then?","Dial M for Murder"
"1363",4926588,4929172,"Well, I was rather ashamedof being caught going to dog racing...","Dial M for Murder"
"1364",4929341,4931592,"when my wife is under sentence of death.","Dial M for Murder"
"1365",4931760,4935971,"Yes, I know how it is.It helps to take your mind off things.","Dial M for Murder"
"1366",4936140,4938099,"Well, that answers everything, doesn't it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1367",4938266,4940018,"I'm sorry to have to bother youat this time.","Dial M for Murder"
"1368",4940185,4941144,"Not at all, inspector.","Dial M for Murder"
"1369",4941311,4942686,"Not at all.","Dial M for Murder"
"1370",4947609,4950403,"Uh, there's just one other thing, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1371",4950570,4953530,"Have you a small, blue attaché case?","Dial M for Murder"
"1372",4953698,4955992,"- Don't say you found it already.- Why, have you lost it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1373",4956159,4958703,"Yes. I was going to report itthis afternoon. I think...","Dial M for Murder"
"1374",4958871,4960622,"- I left it in a taxi.- I see.","Dial M for Murder"
"1375",4961457,4964751,"Well, we-- We must try and get it back,mustn't we?","Dial M for Murder"
"1376",4964917,4966336,"Where did you pick the taxi up, sir?","Dial M for Murder"
"1377",4966502,4968837,"Uh, Hyde Park Cornerabout half an hour ago.","Dial M for Murder"
"1378",4969006,4969713,"Anything valuable?","Dial M for Murder"
"1379",4969881,4972050,"- No, a few books and, uh--- Any money?","Dial M for Murder"
"1380",4972216,4974135,"Two or Ł3 in an envelope, I believe.","Dial M for Murder"
"1381",4974302,4975302,"Not 2- or 300?","Dial M for Murder"
"1382",4975470,4976970,"No, I'm afraid not.","Dial M for Murder"
"1383",4977139,4978347,"Just as well.","Dial M for Murder"
"1384",4978515,4981391,"Inspector, how did you find outabout the attaché case?","Dial M for Murder"
"1385",4981560,4984186,"The wine shop mentioned you had itwhen you paid your bill.","Dial M for Murder"
"1386",4984354,4986855,"So my sergeant checked backon your garage and your tailor.","Dial M for Murder"
"1387",4987024,4989442,"They both remembered you having itwhen you paid them.","Dial M for Murder"
"1388",4989609,4992444,"- Yes, I use it instead of a briefcase.- Mm. Well...","Dial M for Murder"
"1389",4992695,4995073,"these taxi men are pretty goodat turning things in.","Dial M for Murder"
"1390",4995239,4997033,"I hope you'll find it all right, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1391",4999411,5000744,"Inspector, before you go...","Dial M for Murder"
"1392",5002664,5005957,"I think Mr. Wendicehas something to tell you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1393",5006126,5007460,"Has he?","Dial M for Murder"
"1394",5008545,5011005,"Then I'd like to show yousomething in here, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1395",5021307,5024226,"No wonder you couldn't bearto sleep in her bedroom.","Dial M for Murder"
"1396",5024395,5027020,"There must be over Ł500 here.","Dial M for Murder"
"1397",5028940,5030440,"Where did you get it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1398",5031734,5033485,"Well, I can tell you why he got it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1399",5033654,5035863,"This money was to have been paidto a man named Swann...","Dial M for Murder"
"1400",5036030,5040118,"after he murdered Mrs. Wendice.But as you know, there was an accident...","Dial M for Murder"
"1401",5040284,5042703,"so it wasn't necessaryto pay Swann after all.","Dial M for Murder"
"1402",5042871,5045707,"Obviously, he couldn't produce all thiswithout questions being asked...","Dial M for Murder"
"1403",5045873,5047332,"so he lived on it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1404",5047501,5050377,"He's been living on itsince the 27th of March.","Dial M for Murder"
"1405",5050546,5052046,"Well, Mr. Wendice?","Dial M for Murder"
"1406",5052213,5054923,"Before you came, inspector,he was trying to persuade me...","Dial M for Murder"
"1407",5055091,5059177,"to go to the policewith the most fantastic story you ever heard.","Dial M for Murder"
"1408",5059345,5062849,"Apparently, I bribed Swannto murder my wife so that....","Dial M for Murder"
"1409",5063015,5064934,"Correct me if I go wrong, Mark.","Dial M for Murder"
"1410",5065101,5067436,"So that I could inherit all her money.","Dial M for Murder"
"1411",5067604,5071649,"And that isn't all.You remember Mr. Halliday's letter?","Dial M for Murder"
"1412",5071817,5074777,"Well, apparently, Swann didn't steal it, I did...","Dial M for Murder"
"1413",5074987,5077029,"and I wrote those two blackmail notes...","Dial M for Murder"
"1414",5077280,5081033,"and I kept Mr. Halliday's letterand planted it on the body.","Dial M for Murder"
"1415",5082034,5083953,"- And the stocking--- Oh, yes, the stocking.","Dial M for Murder"
"1416",5084121,5086913,"Perhaps I'd better tell this, Mark.Might sound more like a confession.","Dial M for Murder"
"1417",5087082,5089917,"I substituted.... Is that the right word?","Dial M for Murder"
"1418",5090085,5093755,"Yes. I substituted my wife's other stockingfor the one that.... Uh--","Dial M for Murder"
"1419",5093921,5095046,"You do follow me, don't you?","Dial M for Murder"
"1420",5095548,5096716,"What else, Mark?","Dial M for Murder"
"1421",5097842,5098926,"He told Swann...","Dial M for Murder"
"1422",5099094,5101261,"he'd hide his key somewhere out here...","Dial M for Murder"
"1423",5101430,5103722,"probably up on this ledge.","Dial M for Murder"
"1424",5104640,5105932,"Swann let himself in.","Dial M for Murder"
"1425",5106769,5109395,"He hid behind the curtains.Then Wendice phoned from the hotel.","Dial M for Murder"
"1426",5109563,5110979,"- That brought her--- Just one moment.","Dial M for Murder"
"1427",5111148,5112899,"If Swann had used Mr. Wendice's key...","Dial M for Murder"
"1428",5113065,5115067,"it would still have been on himwhen he died.","Dial M for Murder"
"1429",5115234,5118738,"Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get inwhen he returned from the hotel?","Dial M for Murder"
"1430",5118905,5120363,"Well, she could have let him in.","Dial M for Murder"
"1431",5120532,5123408,"He could've taken his key from Swann's pocketbefore the police got here.","Dial M for Murder"
"1432",5123577,5127246,"But he let himself in with his own key.That came out in the trial.","Dial M for Murder"
"1433",5127413,5128163,"Don't you remember?","Dial M for Murder"
"1434",5128332,5131125,"Come on, Mark. Your move.","Dial M for Murder"
"1435",5133545,5134796,"Uh....","Dial M for Murder"
"1436",5136088,5140342,"Swann could have taken the keydown from here, unlocked the door...","Dial M for Murder"
"1437",5140511,5142970,"and then replaced the key on the ledgebefore he came in.","Dial M for Murder"
"1438",5143430,5145096,"All right. This is very interesting...","Dial M for Murder"
"1439",5145265,5148059,"but it isn't getting me any nearerwhat I came to find out.","Dial M for Murder"
"1440",5148226,5150770,"But this is a question of life and death.What else matters?","Dial M for Murder"
"1441",5150938,5153396,"What matters to me iswhere Mr. Wendice got this money.","Dial M for Murder"
"1442",5153564,5154940,"That's all I want to know.","Dial M for Murder"
"1443",5162949,5164992,"Just a moment, please, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1444",5170039,5172792,"Inspector, wait a minute. Look at this.","Dial M for Murder"
"1445",5172960,5175252,"The last check he wrotewas on the 26th of March...","Dial M for Murder"
"1446",5175462,5178338,"the day before this all happened.He's been living off it ever since.","Dial M for Murder"
"1447",5179423,5181634,"- There's his bank--- Mr. Halliday.","Dial M for Murder"
"1448",5181801,5183219,"Sorry.","Dial M for Murder"
"1449",5185721,5190059,"He hasn't drawn any large sums from his bank.Nothing over Ł53.","Dial M for Murder"
"1450",5192479,5195814,"But look, inspector, practically every week.","Dial M for Murder"
"1451",5195983,5197440,"Thirty-five pounds, 40...","Dial M for Murder"
"1452",5197609,5199150,"Ł45, 50.","Dial M for Murder"
"1453",5199319,5200485,"He could've saved it up.","Dial M for Murder"
"1454",5200654,5202779,"Of course I could've beenplanning all this for years.","Dial M for Murder"
"1455",5203155,5204323,"Then where did you get it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1456",5204992,5207993,"Do you really want to know?I warn you, you won't like it, Mark.","Dial M for Murder"
"1457",5208369,5209036,"Come on.","Dial M for Murder"
"1458",5210413,5212163,"All right, you asked for it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1459",5212332,5214332,"When she called me backfrom the party that night...","Dial M for Murder"
"1460",5214501,5218253,"I found her kneeling beside Swann's body,going through his pockets.","Dial M for Murder"
"1461",5218421,5222091,"She kept saying he had something of hers,but she couldn't find it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1462",5222259,5225720,"She was almost hysterical.That's why I wouldn't let the police question her.","Dial M for Murder"
"1463",5225887,5229431,"In the state she was in,she would have told every lie under the sun.","Dial M for Murder"
"1464",5229600,5233685,"The next morning she showed me the moneyjust as it is now, all in Ł1 notes.","Dial M for Murder"
"1465",5234229,5238231,"And she said, ""If anything happens to me,don't let them find this.""","Dial M for Murder"
"1466",5239109,5242278,"Well, after she was arrested,I took the money in that case...","Dial M for Murder"
"1467",5242445,5245363,"to Charing Cross Stationand left it in the checkroom.","Dial M for Murder"
"1468",5245532,5249827,"Whenever I needed money, I took it outand left it in some other checkroom.","Dial M for Murder"
"1469",5250119,5253372,"I knew if you had found it,she wouldn't stand a chance.","Dial M for Murder"
"1470",5253539,5257667,"You see, she was just about to give it to himwhen she killed him instead.","Dial M for Murder"
"1471",5258545,5260962,"You don't expect anyoneto believe this, do you?","Dial M for Murder"
"1472",5261213,5264050,"I have really no idea.What about it, inspector?","Dial M for Murder"
"1473",5264842,5266176,"Hm?","Dial M for Murder"
"1474",5266345,5268845,"Well, I must say I suspected something like that.","Dial M for Murder"
"1475",5269555,5271474,"You're not even gonna check on this?","Dial M for Murder"
"1476",5271641,5272807,"She's being hanged tomorrow.","Dial M for Murder"
"1477",5272975,5275144,"Look, all this has beenout of my hands for months.","Dial M for Murder"
"1478",5275311,5276979,"There's been a trial and an appeal--","Dial M for Murder"
"1479",5277146,5279314,"Oh, of course it wouldn't mean much to you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1480",5279483,5281567,"You'd have to admityou arrested the wrong person.","Dial M for Murder"
"1481",5283403,5284819,"I think you'd better go.","Dial M for Murder"
"1482",5284988,5286905,"You bet I'll go.","Dial M for Murder"
"1483",5289533,5291618,"But you've made one mistake.","Dial M for Murder"
"1484",5291787,5293537,"What'll happen when Margothears about this?","Dial M for Murder"
"1485",5293704,5296832,"- She'll deny it, of course.- And perhaps she'll change her will.","Dial M for Murder"
"1486",5297000,5299377,"You'll have done it all for nothing, Tony.","Dial M for Murder"
"1487",5304466,5307092,"If I'd told that story of his,would anyone have believed me?","Dial M for Murder"
"1488",5308052,5309552,"No, not a chance.","Dial M for Murder"
"1489",5309720,5313807,"Before nearly every execution,someone comes forward like this.","Dial M for Murder"
"1490",5313975,5317228,"This must have been very distressing for you,coming as it did.","Dial M for Murder"
"1491",5317395,5320814,"You suppose they'd let him see her?I don't want her upset just now.","Dial M for Murder"
"1492",5320983,5324193,"Have a word with your lawyer.He might be able to prevent it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1493",5324360,5327154,"I should get all that money into the bankbefore somebody pinches it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1494",5327322,5329073,"Thank you. I think I will.","Dial M for Murder"
"1495",5330492,5333577,"I hope Mr. Halliday's not waiting outsideto see me.","Dial M for Murder"
"1496",5333744,5336663,"Would you mind just taking a look, sir,to make sure he's gone?","Dial M for Murder"
"1497",5346966,5348009,"All clear.","Dial M for Murder"
"1498",5348176,5350927,"Good. Oh, by the way, sir,I was asked to tell you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1499",5351095,5354305,"There are a few things belonging to Mrs. Wendiceat the police station.","Dial M for Murder"
"1500",5354474,5355306,"What sort of things?","Dial M for Murder"
"1501",5355475,5358019,"Oh, just some books and a handbag,I believe.","Dial M for Murder"
"1502",5358185,5360186,"They'd like you to comeand collect them sometime.","Dial M for Murder"
"1503",5360354,5363399,"- You mean after tomorrow?- Yes, or today, if you like.","Dial M for Murder"
"1504",5363567,5365734,"Just ask the desk sergeant.He knows all about it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1505",5365902,5367528,"- Yes.- Well, goodbye, Mr. Wendice.","Dial M for Murder"
"1506",5367695,5369988,"I don't suppose we shall meet again.","Dial M for Murder"
"1507",5370157,5372615,"Goodbye, inspector, and thank you very much.","Dial M for Murder"

"1514",5503331,5507001,"Inspector Hubbard, it's me,Mark Halliday.","Dial M for Murder"
"1515",5509296,5511130,"Now, what are you up to?What's the idea?","Dial M for Murder"
"1516",5511297,5513131,"- What are you doing here?- Never mind that.","Dial M for Murder"
"1517",5513300,5515091,"- I wondered why--- Get out of here, quick.","Dial M for Murder"
"1518",5515260,5516260,"- Listen--- Shut up.","Dial M for Murder"
"1519",5516427,5518845,"You want to save Mrs. Wendice?Keep quiet. Let me handle this.","Dial M for Murder"
"1520",5519890,5521515,"How are you possibly gonna--?","Dial M for Murder"
"1521",5608310,5610061,"Look, what is all this?","Dial M for Murder"
"1522",5610229,5612105,"They talk about flat-footed policemen.","Dial M for Murder"
"1523",5612274,5615900,"May the saints protect usfrom the gifted amateur.","Dial M for Murder"
"1524",5626537,5629789,"You'd better prepare yourselffor a surprise, Mr. Halliday.","Dial M for Murder"
"1525",5638173,5639757,"Margot.","Dial M for Murder"
"1526",5642304,5643595,"Hello, Mark.","Dial M for Murder"

"1528",5646265,5649810,"He-- He's gone out.","Dial M for Murder"
"1529",5649978,5651185,"When will he be back?","Dial M for Murder"
"1530",5651354,5653104,"We're not sure.","Dial M for Murder"
"1531",5653273,5655149,"Was that you who rang just now?","Dial M for Murder"
"1532",5655317,5658735,"Yes. Why didn't you let me in?","Dial M for Murder"
"1533",5658903,5660863,"You've got a key.Why didn't you use it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1534",5661030,5665367,"- I did, but it didn't fit the lock.- No. And you know why, don't you?","Dial M for Murder"
"1535",5665534,5668578,"No, I don't.Has the lock been changed?","Dial M for Murder"
"1536",5668747,5670747,"May I have your bag a moment?","Dial M for Murder"
"1537",5676837,5678588,"Whose key is this?","Dial M for Murder"
"1538",5679173,5682801,"I thought it was mine.I don't know.","Dial M for Murder"
"1539",5688975,5690434,"What's going on here?","Dial M for Murder"
"1540",5696274,5697983,"Your husband's explained this, you know.","Dial M for Murder"
"1541",5698443,5700735,"You can tell us all about it now.","Dial M for Murder"
"1542",5700904,5704030,"What is it? I don't understand.","Dial M for Murder"
"1543",5704865,5707993,"No, I don't believe you do.","Dial M for Murder"
"1544",5711497,5713414,"- Pearson?- Yes, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1545",5714542,5716460,"Take this handbagback to the police station...","Dial M for Murder"

"1548",5720590,5724176,"You can't walk down the street like that.You'll be arrested.","Dial M for Murder"

"1550",5726720,5728596,"Margot, how did you get here?","Dial M for Murder"
"1551",5728765,5730724,"I don't know.","Dial M for Murder"
"1552",5731975,5735061,"About an hour ago,the warden came to see me...","Dial M for Murder"
"1553",5735229,5737605,"and just said I was to be taken home.","Dial M for Murder"
"1554",5737774,5740609,"And then two detectives brought me here.","Dial M for Murder"
"1555",5741069,5746030,"They said I could go,but I couldn't get that door open.","Dial M for Murder"
"1556",5747158,5750452,"Where's Tony?He was supposed to visit me this morning...","Dial M for Murder"
"1557",5750619,5752703,"and they said he couldn't come.","Dial M for Murder"
"1558",5753247,5755164,"Has anything happened to him?","Dial M for Murder"
"1559",5755332,5757876,"No. Nothing.","Dial M for Murder"
"1560",5758252,5759711,"Inspector, I don't wanna interfere...","Dial M for Murder"
"1561",5759878,5762381,"but do you think you could tell uswhat you're up to?","Dial M for Murder"
"1562",5762548,5766551,"Mrs. Wendice, what I'm about to tell youmay come as a shock.","Dial M for Murder"
"1563",5767302,5768345,"Yes?","Dial M for Murder"
"1564",5768512,5772807,"We strongly suspect that your husbandhad planned to murder you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1565",5773475,5776686,"Tony arranged for Swannto come here that night and kill you.","Dial M for Murder"
"1566",5778689,5780649,"How long have you known this?","Dial M for Murder"
"1567",5780817,5782234,"Did you suspect it yourself?","Dial M for Murder"
"1568",5782402,5785737,"No, never. And yet....","Dial M for Murder"
"1569",5788699,5790951,"What's the matter with me, Mark?","Dial M for Murder"
"1570",5792578,5795247,"I don't seem able to feel anything.","Dial M for Murder"
"1571",5796457,5799251,"Shouldn't I break down or something?","Dial M for Murder"
"1572",5799502,5801587,"It's delayed action, that's all.","Dial M for Murder"
"1573",5801753,5805631,"In a couple of days, you're gonna havethe most wonderful breakdown.","Dial M for Murder"
"1574",5805800,5806841,"When did you find out, sir?","Dial M for Murder"
"1575",5807010,5810970,"Well, the first cluecame quite by accident.","Dial M for Murder"
"1576",5811139,5812764,"We discovered that your husband...","Dial M for Murder"
"1577",5812931,5816268,"had been spending a large number of pound notesall over the place.","Dial M for Murder"
"1578",5816435,5818270,"It ran into over Ł300.","Dial M for Murder"
"1579",5818438,5821648,"And it appeared to have startedat about the time you were arrested.","Dial M for Murder"
"1580",5821815,5825985,"Now, I had to find outwhere he got that money and how.","Dial M for Murder"
"1581",5826154,5827320,"And then I remembered...","Dial M for Murder"
"1582",5827488,5830239,"that after you were arrested,we searched this flat.","Dial M for Murder"
"1583",5830408,5833702,"And I saw a copy of his bank statementin that desk.","Dial M for Murder"
"1584",5833869,5837581,"So yesterday afternoon, I went to the prisonand asked to see your handbag.","Dial M for Murder"
"1585",5837748,5841336,"While I was doing this,I managed to lift your latchkey.","Dial M for Murder"
"1586",5842503,5845671,"Highly irregular, of course,but my blood was up.","Dial M for Murder"
"1587",5845840,5848216,"And then this morningwhen your husband was out...","Dial M for Murder"
"1588",5848384,5850844,"I came back hereto look at his statement.","Dial M for Murder"
"1589",5851011,5853596,"I never saw it,because I never got through that door.","Dial M for Murder"
"1590",5853765,5858018,"You see, the key that I'd takenfrom your handbag...","Dial M for Murder"
"1591",5858185,5859685,"didn't fit the lock.","Dial M for Murder"
"1592",5866903,5867569,"Williams?","Dial M for Murder"
"1593",5868137,5868987,"Wendice.","Dial M for Murder"
"1594",5909011,5910737,"Oh, that was a near one.","Dial M for Murder"
"1595",5922375,5924251,"Maida Vale Police. O'Brien speaking.","Dial M for Murder"
"1596",5924418,5927170,"Hubbard. Look, O'Brien,he's found out about his raincoat.","Dial M for Murder"
"1597",5927337,5931341,"He just came back and couldn't get in.I think he's on his way to the station now.","Dial M for Murder"
"1598",5931509,5933719,"- Has Pearson arrived with the handbag?- Yes, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1599",5933886,5937764,"Good. Now, listen.Give Wendice those books and the handbag...","Dial M for Murder"
"1600",5937931,5940016,"and make sure he sees the key.","Dial M for Murder"
"1601",5940435,5943436,"Better make him check the contentsand sign for them.","Dial M for Murder"
"1602",5943604,5947649,"If he wants his own key and raincoat,tell him I've gone to Glasgow.","Dial M for Murder"
"1603",5947817,5948734,"Right, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1604",5948900,5950277,"- Any questions?- No.","Dial M for Murder"
"1605",5950444,5953529,"- Right. Call me back when he leaves.- Right, sir.","Dial M for Murder"
"1606",5956408,5958659,"Well, Mr. Halliday, have you got it?","Dial M for Murder"
"1607",5958828,5960119,"I don't think so.","Dial M for Murder"
"1608",5960287,5962331,"Where's Mrs. Wendice's key?","Dial M for Murder"
"1609",5968712,5970963,"It took me just half an hour to find it.","Dial M for Murder"
"1610",5975177,5978387,"But if it was there,why didn't Wendice use it just now?","Dial M for Murder"
"1611",5978555,5980681,"Didn't use it becausehe doesn't realize it's there.","Dial M for Murder"
"1612",5980850,5985186,"He still thinks it's in his wife's handbag.You see, you were very nearly right.","Dial M for Murder"
"1613",5985354,5987564,"He told Swann that he would leave your latchkey...","Dial M for Murder"
"1614",5987731,5989565,"under the stair carpet, Mrs. Wendice...","Dial M for Murder"
"1615",5989734,5993444,"and told him to return itto the same place when he left.","Dial M for Murder"
"1616",5993613,5995780,"But as Swann was killed,we naturally assumed...","Dial M for Murder"
"1617",5995948,5998050,"that your key would still bein one of Swann's pockets.","Dial M for Murder"
"1618",5999118,6000827,"That was his little mistake...","Dial M for Murder"
"1619",6000994,6004413,"because Swann had doneexactly as you suggested, Mr. Halliday.","Dial M for Murder"
"1620",6004582,6006792,"He unlocked the door...","Dial M for Murder"
"1621",6006958,6010628,"then returned the keybefore he came in.","Dial M for Murder"
"1622",6010796,6012713,"And it's been out there ever since.","Dial M for Murder"
"1623",6012881,6016134,"And the key Wendice took outof Swann's pocket...","Dial M for Murder"
"1624",6016301,6017719,"and returned to her handbag was--","Dial M for Murder"
"1625",6017886,6020305,"Swann's own latchkey.","Dial M for Murder"

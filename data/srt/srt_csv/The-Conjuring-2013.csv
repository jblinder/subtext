"460",2649159,2650206,"Oh.","The Conjuring"
"461",2650360,2652726,"Did you personally perform the exorcism?","The Conjuring"
"462",2652920,2655730,"No, I'm not authorized.But I've assisted on many.","The Conjuring"
"463",2655920,2657842,"See, an exorcismcan be very dangerous...","The Conjuring"
"464",2658000,2661048,"not only for the victim,but for anyone in the room.","The Conjuring"
"465",2661719,2664121,"- What happened to Maurice?- He tried to kill his wife...","The Conjuring"
"466",2664400,2667643,"but instead shot her in the armand then turned the gun on himself.","The Conjuring"
"467",2667800,2671246,"Maurice had a very troubled lifewith little to live for...","The Conjuring"
"468",2671400,2674289,"and not even an exorcistcould bring him back.","The Conjuring"
"469",2674840,2677889,"Which brings us to the three stagesof demonic activity:","The Conjuring"
"470",2678039,2680280,"Infestation, oppression and possession.","The Conjuring"
"471",2680440,2681804,"Now, infestation:","The Conjuring"
"472",2681960,2685931,"That's the whispering, the footsteps,the feeling of another presence...","The Conjuring"
"473",2686119,2689760,"which ultimately growsinto oppression, the second stage.","The Conjuring"
"474",2689920,2692206,"Now this is where the victim,and it's usually the one...","The Conjuring"
"475",2692360,2694248,"who's the mostpsychologically vulnerable...","The Conjuring"
"476",2694400,2697289,"is targeted specificallyby an external force.","The Conjuring"
"477",2697440,2700887,"Breaks the victim down.Crushes their will.","The Conjuring"
"478",2701079,2706291,"And, once in a weakened state, leads themto the third and final stage: possession.","The Conjuring"
"479",2709440,2711010,"- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?- Yeah.","The Conjuring"
"480",2711159,2713606,"There's someone herethat would like to talk to you.","The Conjuring"

"485",2722440,2724282,"You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.","The Conjuring"
"486",2724440,2727204,"- We really need to head to our family.- You don't understand.","The Conjuring"
"487",2727360,2730250,"But we do. There's usually somesort of rational explanation...","The Conjuring"
"488",2730400,2735166,"I have five daughters who are scared to death.I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.","The Conjuring"
"489",2735320,2739166,"You have a daughter. Wouldn't you doanything you could to protect her? Please.","The Conjuring"

"511",2807119,2810646,"I'm constantly turning up the heat,but the house is always freezing.","The Conjuring"
"512",2810800,2812722,"It's not a problem with the furnace.","The Conjuring"
"513",2812880,2814166,"I mean, not that I can find.","The Conjuring"
"514",2819400,2823166,"It's gotten a lotworse the past few nights.","The Conjuring"
"515",2823679,2829050,"There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.It moves around the house.","The Conjuring"
"516",2832000,2833081,"Uh...","The Conjuring"
"517",2833239,2834445,"What? What is it?","The Conjuring"
"518",2835159,2840530,"Well, rancid smells could indicatesome type of demonic activity.","The Conjuring"
"519",2840760,2841840,"Oh, my God.","The Conjuring"
"520",2846280,2848567,"That's to keep those doorsfrom banging at night.","The Conjuring"
"521",2848719,2852166,"Otherwise, it's like:All night long, just like that.","The Conjuring"
"522",2853519,2855648,"- Does it come in threes?- Yeah.","The Conjuring"
"523",2855800,2856960,"It stops at dawn?","The Conjuring"
"524",2857559,2858766,"Uh-huh.","The Conjuring"
"525",2860760,2864047,"Well, sometimes it's meantas an insult to the Trinity:","The Conjuring"
"526",2864199,2866168,"The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.","The Conjuring"
"527",2867880,2871487,"You know, it's the damndest thing,but we also get all kinds of birds...","The Conjuring"
"528",2871679,2874650,"that will just fly against the sideof the house and break their necks.","The Conjuring"
"529",2874800,2876449,"Hm. Really?","The Conjuring"
"530",2876639,2879041,"And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.","The Conjuring"

"533",2887599,2891889,"Something just kept knocking them down,so we stopped hanging them up.","The Conjuring"
"534",2895320,2897606,"That's what I was talking about.","The Conjuring"
"535",2897920,2899684,"It was here when we moved in.","The Conjuring"
"536",2899840,2902047,"There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.","The Conjuring"
"537",2905119,2906451,"Show me the cellar.","The Conjuring"
"538",2918559,2921166,"Look what she made me do.","The Conjuring"

"542",2937480,2941530,"Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.","The Conjuring"
"543",2943519,2947081,"You know, with all that's been going on,why haven't you just moved out?","The Conjuring"
"544",2947400,2949367,"I don't know wherewe'd move to, you know?","The Conjuring"
"545",2949519,2953844,"We got all our money tied up in this placeand had a lot of repairs on top of that.","The Conjuring"
"546",2954480,2958485,"And I don't know anybody whose gonnatake in a family of seven indefinitely.","The Conjuring"
"547",2958679,2960568,"That's why we tracked you down.","The Conjuring"
"548",2961039,2962804,"We're glad you found us.","The Conjuring"
"549",2963280,2965601,"All right, let's get started.","The Conjuring"
"550",2967719,2971166,"My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.","The Conjuring"
"551",2971360,2973362,"I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...","The Conjuring"
"552",2973519,2977730,"who, with her family, has beenexperiencing supernatural occurrences.","The Conjuring"
"553",2978639,2980130,"Okay, go ahead.","The Conjuring"
"554",2981639,2983050,"Where do I start?","The Conjuring"
"555",2983599,2985284,"From the first occurrence.","The Conjuring"
"556",2986320,2988367,"I guess it was the clocks.","The Conjuring"
"557",2988519,2990487,"Mom and Dad tell methat you have a friend.","The Conjuring"
"558",2990639,2992880,"His name's Rory.He lives here too.","The Conjuring"
"559",2993039,2994882,"- Hmm.- But he's always sad.","The Conjuring"
"560",2995039,2996086,"Why is that?","The Conjuring"
"561",2996239,3000039,"He won't tell me but I thinksomething bad happened to him.","The Conjuring"
"562",3002760,3005001,"Do you mind if I try to see Rory?","The Conjuring"
"563",3096079,3097161,"Hey.","The Conjuring"
"564",3107920,3109206,"What is it?","The Conjuring"
"565",3130360,3134489,"We bought it at auction from the bank, so,you know, we never knew who lived here.","The Conjuring"
"566",3139159,3144371,"Well, Lorraine and I both feel thatwhat your house needs is a cleansing.","The Conjuring"
"567",3145639,3146846,"An exorcism.","The Conjuring"
"568",3148440,3149885,"What, exorcism?","The Conjuring"
"569",3151840,3154809,"I thought that was somethingthat you do to people.","The Conjuring"
"570",3155000,3156364,"No, not necessarily, no.","The Conjuring"
"571",3157000,3158331,"We have to get out of here.","The Conjuring"
"572",3158480,3160481,"I'm afraid that's not gonna help.","The Conjuring"
"573",3162519,3164806,"Lorraine saw something, which...","The Conjuring"
"574",3164960,3166246,"Go ahead, hon.","The Conjuring"
"575",3168679,3172047,"I've been seeing the dark entitythat haunts your house...","The Conjuring"
"576",3172199,3173724,"and your land.","The Conjuring"
"577",3178239,3181766,"I saw it first when I camethrough your door.","The Conjuring"
"578",3181920,3184126,"It was latched to your back.","The Conjuring"
"579",3186480,3190690,"And then I saw it again with the girlswhen we walked into the living room.","The Conjuring"
"580",3191599,3193887,"And it doesn't matter where you go...","The Conjuring"
"581",3194079,3197208,"this dark entity has latched itselfto your family...","The Conjuring"
"582",3197360,3198885,"and it's feeding off you.","The Conjuring"
"583",3201960,3204088,"Even if we leave?","The Conjuring"
"584",3204239,3206925,"Sometimes when you get haunted,it's like stepping on gum.","The Conjuring"
"585",3207480,3209369,"You take it with you.","The Conjuring"
"586",3210280,3213523,"Look, I gotta tell you,you have a lot of spirits in here...","The Conjuring"
"587",3213679,3218288,"but this is the one that I'm mostworried about, because it is so hateful.","The Conjuring"
"588",3219039,3222010,"Okay, so what do we do?Can we call a priest?","The Conjuring"
"589",3222159,3223490,"I wish it were that easy.","The Conjuring"
"590",3223639,3227644,"Performing an exorcism is an archaicprocedure. Requires years of training.","The Conjuring"
"591",3228519,3232570,"And even then,I have seen it go horribly wrong.","The Conjuring"
"592",3233519,3237240,"But before we even get that far,the church has to authorize it first.","The Conjuring"
"593",3237400,3240643,"It means we gotta investigate,gather evidence and provide proof...","The Conjuring"
"594",3240840,3242329,"and that's the hard part.","The Conjuring"
"595",3244480,3246208,"Have your children been baptized?","The Conjuring"
"596",3246360,3250684,"Uh, no, we never got around to that.We're not really a churchgoing family.","The Conjuring"
"597",3250920,3254527,"Well, you may want to rethink that.Our presence here could make things worse.","The Conjuring"
"598",3254679,3255806,"Why?","The Conjuring"
"599",3255960,3257324,"Because we're a threat.","The Conjuring"
"600",3257519,3260409,"And whatever you're dealing with hereisn't gonna like us.","The Conjuring"
"601",3260559,3264121,"So far it hasn't done anything violent,and that's a good sign.","The Conjuring"
"602",3264320,3267210,"So we're gonna have our guydo some homework on the property...","The Conjuring"
"603",3267360,3269168,"to see what we're up against.","The Conjuring"
"604",3271400,3273208,"Judy, what are you up to?","The Conjuring"
"605",3273360,3276125,"- I got you a present.- Aah.","The Conjuring"
"606",3276280,3279362,"Me and Nanna got theseat the church's yard sale.","The Conjuring"
"607",3279519,3281362,"- Honey.- One for you and one for me.","The Conjuring"
"608",3281519,3283090,"- Aw.- She put a picture...","The Conjuring"
"609",3283239,3284525,"of you and Daddy in mine.","The Conjuring"
"610",3285039,3288202,"Nanna said this waywe'll always be together.","The Conjuring"
"611",3288360,3290885,"You'll be with me and I'll be with you.","The Conjuring"
"612",3293559,3295688,"I miss you and Daddy.","The Conjuring"
"613",3306320,3307445,"Hey, hon.","The Conjuring"
"614",3309679,3310726,"Yup.","The Conjuring"
"615",3310880,3313724,"You're not gonna believe this.Carolyn's voice didn't record.","The Conjuring"
"616",3315079,3316126,"What do you mean?","The Conjuring"
"617",3317079,3318286,"Listen.","The Conjuring"
"618",3318800,3322246,"My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.","The Conjuring"
"619",3322400,3324242,"I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...","The Conjuring"

"623",3338199,3339485,"Nothing.","The Conjuring"
"624",3340079,3341240,"The whole time.","The Conjuring"
"625",3341440,3343965,"- I don't know. You find anything?- Lots.","The Conjuring"
"626",3344599,3347570,"I mean, it's no wonder they'regoing through what they are.","The Conjuring"
"627",3347840,3349762,"That's the original farmhouse.","The Conjuring"
"628",3349920,3353003,"It was built in 1863 by a mannamed Jedson Sherman...","The Conjuring"
"629",3353239,3355766,"who was married to a womannamed Bathsheba.","The Conjuring"
"630",3356119,3359202,"Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.","The Conjuring"
"631",3359360,3361561,"She was one of the womenaccused of witchcraft in Salem.","The Conjuring"

"633",3363760,3366650,"After Bathsheba married Jedson,they had a baby...","The Conjuring"
"634",3366840,3368648,"and when the baby was 7 days old...","The Conjuring"
"635",3368840,3371730,"Jedson caught her sacrificing itin front of the fireplace.","The Conjuring"
"636",3371880,3373961,"She ran out to that tree by the dock...","The Conjuring"
"637",3374119,3376282,"climbed up, proclaimed her loveto Satan...","The Conjuring"
"638",3376440,3380331,"cursed anyone who triedto take her land, and hung herself.","The Conjuring"
"639",3382159,3385766,"Time of death was pronounced at 3:07in the morning.","The Conjuring"
"640",3386119,3387884,"Well, that explains a few things.","The Conjuring"

"330",1706254,1708017,"That's what's eating me.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"331",1708089,1710990,"What kind of prescription you got for that?","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"335",1719100,1720397,"Why not?","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"336",1721603,1725232,"Because maybe this fellow Macreedy'sgot the prescription.","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"345",2077859,2080157,"I'll be glad to pay for the damages.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"346",2080228,2082560,"It's a threat to life and limb.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"347",2083097,2085292,"Fortunately, no one was hurt.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"348",2085633,2090195,"You could get yourself killed that way,nosing all over the countryside.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"349",2092473,2094998,"I guess that's a danger, all right.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"350",2095676,2099669,"That's pretty smart of you.How long do you intend to keep it up?","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"361",2140054,2142386,"I'm inclined to agree with you.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"362",2176657,2180525,"If you're looking for the keys to the jeep,they're not there.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"363",2180761,2184162,"- Where would you suggest I look?- The jeep's not for rent.","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"374",2229443,2230535,"But what?","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"375",2230611,2233079,"I have a feelingyou're a little bit too unconcerned.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"376",2233147,2235615,"You're so unconcerned,you won't even rent me a jeep.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"377",2235683,2238083,"I don't own a taxi service.I don't have a license.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"378",2238152,2239619,"Too bad everybody in this town...","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"379",2239687,2243316,"isn't as scrupulously devotedto law and order as you are.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"380",2244592,2246822,"I don't want to get involved.","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"387",2263377,2266471,"My brother, Pete, he'd never leave.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"388",2266814,2269578,"Did it ever occur to youthat you might leave without him?","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"389",2269650,2272585,"You look like an independent young lady.Your brother seems...","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"393",2280494,2282655,"I don't care anything about Black Rock.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"394",2282730,2286257,"Only it seems to me that there aren'tmany towns like this in America.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"395",2286334,2288700,"But one town like it is enough.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"396",2290037,2293564,"And because I think something kind of badhappened here, Miss Wirth.","Bad Day at Black Rock"
"397",2293641,2296974,"Something they can't quite seemto find a handle to.","Bad Day at Black Rock"

"1510",4612399,4613912,"That cannot take Glenn.","Hidden Figures"
"1511",4614880,4616471,"Now, the Atlas rocket...","Hidden Figures"
"1512",4617279,4619077,"that can push us into orbit.","Hidden Figures"
"1513",4619239,4622356,"Goes up, delivers the capsuleinto an elliptical orbit.","Hidden Figures"
"1514",4623239,4624957,"Earth's gravitykeeps pulling at it","Hidden Figures"

"1518",4632960,4634551,"that's the mathwe don't know.","Hidden Figures"
"1519",4636640,4637640,"Yes, Katherine.","Hidden Figures"
"1520",4637800,4640472,"So the capsule will spinaround the Earth forever","Hidden Figures"

"1522",4643279,4644279,"That's right.","Hidden Figures"

"1526",4653479,4654479,"Yes, Katherine.","Hidden Figures"
"1527",4654640,4658076,"So it needs to movefrom an elliptical orbit...","Hidden Figures"

"1529",4661880,4662880,"Yes.","Hidden Figures"

"1538",4680079,4683435,"distance, friction,or a puff of wind...","Hidden Figures"
"1539",4684359,4686395,"would alter the ""Go/No-go.""","Hidden Figures"
"1540",4686560,4689518,"And we startour calculations over.","Hidden Figures"
"1541",4689920,4690920,"Yes.","Hidden Figures"
"1542",4691680,4696435,"So we need to be able tochoose this reentry point.","Hidden Figures"
"1543",4696600,4699591,"Now this ""Go/No-go,""this has to be exact.","Hidden Figures"

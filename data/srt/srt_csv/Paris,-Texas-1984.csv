"1100",7028354,7030522,"You showed me I was.","Paris, Texas"
"1101",7034027,7037029,"But the biggest thing I hoped for...","Paris, Texas"
"1102",7039198,7041199,"can't come true.","Paris, Texas"
"1103",7043536,7046038,"I know that now.","Paris, Texas"
"1104",7047707,7050208,"You belong together with your mother.","Paris, Texas"
"1105",7052545,7055338,"You belong together with your mother.","Paris, Texas"
"1106",7056966,7060135,"It was me that tore you apart...","Paris, Texas"
"1107",7060219,7063722,"and I owe it to you to bring you back together.","Paris, Texas"
"1108",7065141,7067684,"But I can't stay with you.","Paris, Texas"
"1109",7067769,7071354,"I could never heal up what happened.","Paris, Texas"
"1110",7071439,7074900,"That's just the way it is.","Paris, Texas"
"1111",7074984,7078361,"I can't even hardly remember what happened.","Paris, Texas"
"1112",7078446,7080822,"It's like a gap.","Paris, Texas"
"1113",7080907,7083617,"But it left me alone in a way that...","Paris, Texas"
"1114",7083701,7086078,"I haven't gotten over.","Paris, Texas"
"1115",7086162,7089748,"And right now, I'm afraid.","Paris, Texas"
"1116",7091459,7094586,"I'm afraid of walking away again.","Paris, Texas"
"1117",7094670,7097172,"I'm afraid of what I might find.","Paris, Texas"
"1118",7098674,7101384,"But I'm even more afraid of...","Paris, Texas"
"1119",7101469,7104763,"not facing this fear.","Paris, Texas"
"1120",7104847,7107349,"I love you, Hunter.","Paris, Texas"
"1121",7108518,7111269,"I love you more than my life.","Paris, Texas"
"1122",7122281,7126201,"Hey.","Paris, Texas"
"1123",7130706,7133458,"Can I tell you something?","Paris, Texas"
"1124",7135002,7137712,"Sure. Anything you like.","Paris, Texas"
"1125",7139215,7141174,"It's kind of long.","Paris, Texas"
"1126",7142218,7144553,"I got plenty of time.","Paris, Texas"
"1127",7167952,7170328,"I knew these people.","Paris, Texas"
"1128",7170413,7172372,"What people?","Paris, Texas"
"1129",7173624,7175625,"These two people.","Paris, Texas"
"1130",7180715,7183216,"They were in love with each other.","Paris, Texas"
"1131",7185720,7188430,"The girl was... very young...","Paris, Texas"
"1132",7188514,7192184,"about 17 or 18, I guess.","Paris, Texas"
"1133",7193603,7197105,"And the guy was... quite a bit older.","Paris, Texas"
"1134",7198649,7201776,"He was kind of raggedy and wild.","Paris, Texas"
"1135",7202904,7205363,"And she was very beautiful, you know?","Paris, Texas"
"1136",7207366,7209284,"Yeah.","Paris, Texas"
"1137",7209368,7213538,"And together they turned everythinginto a kind of an adventure...","Paris, Texas"
"1138",7214790,7217709,"and she liked that.","Paris, Texas"
"1139",7217793,7221588,"Just an ordinary tripdown to the grocery store was...","Paris, Texas"
"1140",7221672,7224716,"full of adventure.","Paris, Texas"
"1141",7224800,7228553,"And they were always laughingat stupid things.","Paris, Texas"
"1142",7228638,7231765,"He liked to make her laugh.","Paris, Texas"
"1143",7231849,7233850,"And...","Paris, Texas"
"1144",7235394,7238104,"they didn't much care for anything else...","Paris, Texas"
"1145",7238189,7242108,"because all they wanted to dowas be with each other.","Paris, Texas"
"1146",7243861,7246363,"They were always together.","Paris, Texas"
"1147",7246447,7249074,"Sounds like they were very happy.","Paris, Texas"
"1148",7249158,7251993,"Yes, they were.","Paris, Texas"
"1149",7252078,7254913,"They were real happy.","Paris, Texas"
"1150",7254997,7258333,"And he - he loved her more than...","Paris, Texas"
"1151",7260836,7263004,"he ever felt possible.","Paris, Texas"
"1152",7266008,7270595,"He couldn't stand being away from her,uh, during the day when he went to work.","Paris, Texas"
"1153",7276018,7279020,"So he quit...","Paris, Texas"
"1154",7279105,7281773,"just to be home with her.","Paris, Texas"
"1155",7281857,7285986,"Then he'd get anotherjobwhen the money ran out...","Paris, Texas"
"1156",7286070,7288613,"and then he'd quit again.","Paris, Texas"
"1157",7288698,7291533,"But pretty soon, she started to worry.","Paris, Texas"
"1158",7295913,7298748,"- About what?- Money, I guess.","Paris, Texas"
"1159",7298833,7300750,"- Not having enough.- Mmm.","Paris, Texas"
"1160",7300835,7303211,"Not knowingwhen the next check was coming in.","Paris, Texas"
"1161",7305339,7308133,"Yep, I know that feeling.","Paris, Texas"
"1162",7308217,7312971,"So he started to get kind of torn inside.","Paris, Texas"
"1163",7316642,7319019,"How do you mean?","Paris, Texas"
"1164",7319103,7322188,"Well, he knew he had to work to support her...","Paris, Texas"
"1165",7322273,7325275,"but he couldn't standbeing away from her either.","Paris, Texas"
"1166",7326944,7328862,"I see.","Paris, Texas"
"1167",7328946,7332449,"And the more he was away from her,the crazier he got...","Paris, Texas"
"1168",7333576,7336578,"except now he got really crazy.","Paris, Texas"
"1169",7340041,7342584,"He started imagining all kinds of things.","Paris, Texas"
"1170",7344337,7346254,"Like what?","Paris, Texas"
"1171",7347923,7352135,"He started thinkingthat she was seeing other men on the sly.","Paris, Texas"
"1172",7353471,7356306,"He'd come home from workand accuse her of...","Paris, Texas"
"1173",7356390,7358850,"spending the day with somebody else.","Paris, Texas"
"1174",7358934,7361686,"He'd yell at her and break things in the trailer.","Paris, Texas"
"1175",7364190,7366107,"The trailer.","Paris, Texas"
"1176",7371280,7373698,"Yes.","Paris, Texas"
"1177",7373783,7376284,"They lived in a trailer home.","Paris, Texas"
"1178",7391050,7395178,"Excuse me, sir,but were you in to visit me the other day?","Paris, Texas"
"1179",7395262,7397597,"I don't mean to pry.","Paris, Texas"
"1180",7399308,7401893,"No.","Paris, Texas"
"1181",7401977,7403895,"Oh.","Paris, Texas"
"1182",7405356,7409025,"I thought I recognized your voice for a minute.","Paris, Texas"
"1183",7410486,7413488,"No. Wasn't me.","Paris, Texas"
"1184",7414865,7416825,"Mm-hmm.","Paris, Texas"
"1185",7418828,7420829,"Please go on.","Paris, Texas"
"1186",7423249,7427585,"Anyway, he started to drink real bad...","Paris, Texas"
"1187",7427670,7430839,"and he'd stay out late to test her.","Paris, Texas"
"1188",7432675,7435552,"What do you mean ""test her""?","Paris, Texas"
"1189",7435636,7438304,"To see if she'd get jealous.","Paris, Texas"
"1190",7439306,7441975,"Mm-hmm.","Paris, Texas"
"1191",7443727,7447564,"He wanted her to get jealous, but she didn't.","Paris, Texas"
"1192",7447648,7450066,"She just worried about him...","Paris, Texas"
"1193",7450151,7452652,"but that got him even madder.","Paris, Texas"
"1194",7453863,7456281,"Why?","Paris, Texas"
"1195",7456365,7458700,"Because...","Paris, Texas"
"1196",7458784,7462203,"he thought if she never got jealous of himthat she didn't really care about him.","Paris, Texas"
"1197",7463873,7468293,"Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.","Paris, Texas"
"1198",7468377,7470795,"And then one night -","Paris, Texas"
"1199",7470880,7475008,"one night she told him that she was pregnant.","Paris, Texas"
"1200",7475092,7477969,"She was about three or four months' pregnant...","Paris, Texas"
"1201",7478053,7480305,"and he didn't even know.","Paris, Texas"
"1202",7480389,7483641,"And then suddenly everything changed.","Paris, Texas"
"1203",7483726,7487687,"He stopped drinking and got a steadyjob.","Paris, Texas"
"1204",7487771,7492734,"He was convinced that she loved him nowbecause she was carrying his child.","Paris, Texas"
"1205",7492818,7496779,"And he was going to dedicate himselfto making a home for her.","Paris, Texas"
"1206",7497948,7500658,"But a funny thing started to happen.","Paris, Texas"
"1207",7500743,7502368,"What?","Paris, Texas"
"1208",7502453,7504871,"He didn't even notice it at first.","Paris, Texas"
"1209",7504955,7507582,"She started to change.","Paris, Texas"
"1210",7507666,7512587,"From the day the baby was born, she beganto get irritated with everything around her.","Paris, Texas"
"1211",7512671,7515423,"She got mad at everything.","Paris, Texas"
"1212",7515508,7519010,"Even the baby seemed to be an injustice to her.","Paris, Texas"
"1213",7519094,7522055,"He kept tryingto make everything all right for her -","Paris, Texas"
"1214",7522139,7526476,"buy her things,take her out to dinner once a week.","Paris, Texas"
"1215",7526560,7529312,"But nothing seemed to satisfy her.","Paris, Texas"
"1216",7529396,7533066,"For two years,he struggled to pull them back together...","Paris, Texas"
"1217",7533150,7536528,"like they were when they first met...","Paris, Texas"
"1218",7536612,7541115,"but finally he knewthat it was never gonna work out.","Paris, Texas"
"1219",7542535,7544661,"So he hit the bottle again.","Paris, Texas"
"1220",7544745,7547789,"But this time, it got mean.","Paris, Texas"
"1221",7547873,7550416,"This time, when he came home late at night...","Paris, Texas"
"1222",7550501,7553836,"she wasn't worried about him orjealous.","Paris, Texas"
"1223",7553921,7556297,"She was just enraged.","Paris, Texas"
"1224",7557800,7562220,"She accused him of holding her captiveby making her have a baby.","Paris, Texas"
"1225",7564139,7567100,"She told him that she dreamed about escaping.","Paris, Texas"
"1226",7567184,7571062,"That was all she dreamed about - escape.","Paris, Texas"
"1227",7571146,7575024,"She saw herself at night,running naked down a highway...","Paris, Texas"
"1228",7575109,7577235,"running across fields...","Paris, Texas"
"1229",7577319,7579279,"running down riverbeds.","Paris, Texas"
"1230",7579363,7581281,"Always running.","Paris, Texas"
"1231",7581365,7585702,"And always, just when she wasabout to get away, he'd be there.","Paris, Texas"
"1232",7585786,7589080,"He would stop her somehow.","Paris, Texas"
"1233",7589164,7591833,"He would just appear and stop her.","Paris, Texas"
"1234",7594712,7599257,"And when she told him these dreams,he believed them.","Paris, Texas"
"1235",7599341,7603177,"He knew she had to be stopped,or she'd leave him forever.","Paris, Texas"
"1236",7603262,7605930,"So he tied a cowbell to her ankle...","Paris, Texas"
"1237",7606015,7610018,"so he could hear at nightif she tried to get out of bed.","Paris, Texas"
"1238",7610102,7613980,"But she learned how to muffle the bellby stuffing a sock into it...","Paris, Texas"
"1239",7614064,7617108,"and inching her way out of the bed...","Paris, Texas"
"1240",7617192,7619110,"and into the night.","Paris, Texas"
"1241",7620321,7622196,"He caught her one nightwhen the sock fell out...","Paris, Texas"
"1242",7622281,7624824,"and he heard her trying to run to the highway.","Paris, Texas"
"1243",7624908,7627577,"He caught her,dragged her back to the trailer...","Paris, Texas"
"1244",7627661,7630705,"and tied her to the stove with his belt.","Paris, Texas"
"1245",7632541,7637211,"He just left her there and went back to bed...","Paris, Texas"
"1246",7637296,7641174,"and lay there, listening to her scream.","Paris, Texas"
"1247",7641258,7645511,"Then he listened to his son scream.","Paris, Texas"
"1248",7645596,7648097,"He was surprised at himself because...","Paris, Texas"
"1249",7648182,7651017,"he didn't feel anything anymore.","Paris, Texas"
"1250",7652603,7655605,"All he wanted to do was sleep.","Paris, Texas"
"1251",7657524,7659734,"And for the first time...","Paris, Texas"
"1252",7659818,7662612,"he wished he were far away...","Paris, Texas"
"1253",7665741,7670536,"lost in a deep, vast countrywhere nobody knew him...","Paris, Texas"
"1254",7670621,7673289,"somewhere without language...","Paris, Texas"
"1255",7673374,7676084,"or streets.","Paris, Texas"
"1256",7676168,7680171,"And he dreamed about this placewithout knowing its name.","Paris, Texas"
"1257",7680255,7683591,"And when he woke up, he was on fire.","Paris, Texas"
"1258",7686595,7690556,"There were blue flamesburning the sheets of his bed.","Paris, Texas"
"1259",7690641,7693351,"He ran through the flames...","Paris, Texas"
"1260",7693435,7696938,"toward the only two people he loved...","Paris, Texas"
"1261",7697022,7698940,"but they were gone.","Paris, Texas"
"1262",7701610,7705613,"His arms were burning,and he threw himself outside and -","Paris, Texas"
"1263",7707282,7709951,"and rolled on the wet ground.","Paris, Texas"
"1264",7712204,7714205,"Then he ran.","Paris, Texas"
"1265",7715457,7717959,"He never looked back at the fire.","Paris, Texas"
"1266",7720462,7722672,"He just ran.","Paris, Texas"
"1267",7728554,7731222,"He ran until the sun came up...","Paris, Texas"
"1268",7732433,7735560,"and he couldn't run any further.","Paris, Texas"
"1269",7736729,7739230,"Then when the sun went down...","Paris, Texas"
"1270",7739314,7741315,"he ran again.","Paris, Texas"
"1271",7747156,7751075,"For five days, he ran like this...","Paris, Texas"
"1272",7751160,7754036,"until every sign of man...","Paris, Texas"
"1273",7756790,7758791,"had disappeared.","Paris, Texas"
"1274",7769845,7771804,"Travis.","Paris, Texas"
"1275",7814348,7817600,"If you turn the light off in there,will you be able to see me?","Paris, Texas"
"1276",7826026,7828027,"I don't know.","Paris, Texas"
"1277",7832533,7834534,"I never tried.","Paris, Texas"
"1278",7853303,7855471,"Can you see me?","Paris, Texas"
"1279",7856974,7859684,"Yeah.","Paris, Texas"
"1280",7859768,7861936,"Do you recognize me?","Paris, Texas"
"1281",7864022,7865940,"Oh, Travis.","Paris, Texas"
"1282",7873407,7875908,"I brought Hunter with me.","Paris, Texas"
"1283",7888005,7890339,"Don't you want to see him?","Paris, Texas"
"1284",7892426,7894343,"Yeah.","Paris, Texas"
"1285",7902978,7907523,"I wanted to see him so badthat I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.","Paris, Texas"
"1286",7913655,7916490,"Anne kept sendin' me pictures of him...","Paris, Texas"
"1287",7919453,7921954,"until I asked her to stop.","Paris, Texas"
"1288",7928170,7931213,"I couldn't stand the... pain...","Paris, Texas"
"1289",7931298,7934300,"of seeing him grow up and missin' it.","Paris, Texas"
"1290",7943185,7946187,"Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?","Paris, Texas"
"1291",7949316,7951317,"I couldn't, Travis.","Paris, Texas"
"1292",7955447,7958449,"I didn't have what I knew he needed.","Paris, Texas"
"1293",7965082,7968751,"I didn't want to use himto fill all my emptiness.","Paris, Texas"
"1294",7974132,7976467,"Well, he needs you now, Jane...","Paris, Texas"
"1295",7976551,7978511,"and he wants to see you.","Paris, Texas"
"1296",7978595,7980596,"He does?","Paris, Texas"
"1297",7983058,7984976,"Yes.","Paris, Texas"
"1298",7989106,7991607,"He's - He's waiting for you.","Paris, Texas"
"1299",7991692,7993609,"Where?","Paris, Texas"
"1300",7996113,7998614,"Downtown...","Paris, Texas"
"1301",7998699,8000700,"in a hotel.","Paris, Texas"
"1302",8002577,8004495,"The Meridian.","Paris, Texas"
"1303",8006456,8008416,"Room 1520.","Paris, Texas"
"1304",8013296,8015256,"1520.","Paris, Texas"
"1305",8016341,8019176,"You're not going, are you?","Paris, Texas"
"1306",8033859,8036360,"I can't see you, Jane.","Paris, Texas"
"1307",8038238,8046238,"Don't go yet.","Paris, Texas"
"1308",8064806,8066766,"I -","Paris, Texas"
"1309",8068977,8072646,"I used to make up long speeches to youafter you left.","Paris, Texas"
"1310",8077694,8080404,"I used to talk to you all the time...","Paris, Texas"
"1311",8080489,8082823,"even though I was alone.","Paris, Texas"
"1312",8086161,8089663,"I walked around for months talking to you.","Paris, Texas"
"1313",8093710,8096212,"Now I don't know what to say.","Paris, Texas"
"1314",8100801,8103803,"It was easier when I just imagined you.","Paris, Texas"
"1315",8111686,8114688,"I even imagined you talking back to me.","Paris, Texas"

"201",1248180,1252480,"Well, we've got to try it.We're not getting hits
on those sub-pens.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"202",1254853,1259722,"Yeah, I know. Then twist it.Had the same request all day.
So long, Curt.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"203",1259791,1263887,"The Wailing Wall is justaround the corner, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"204",1265197,1269930,"Oh, I don't know.I guess this is it. Sit down.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"205",1270002,1272061,"If you're on the levelabout this 9,000 foot stuff,","Twelve O'Clock High"
"206",1272137,1275470,"the boys will drop their bombshere tomorrow instead of St. Nazaire.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"207",1275540,1281206,"- Look, Frank...- It won't work. It was tough at
19,000 it'll be suicide at nine.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"208",1281280,1285341,"The guy who dreamed this one upought to have his brain
in a glass jar at Harvard.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"209",1285417,1287885,"- Anything else?- You're kidding?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"210",1287953,1291684,"You've been a group commander.You didn't lead the first
ten missions for nothing.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"211",1291790,1295487,"- Why couldn't you tell themwhat it'll be like? You...
- Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"212",1295560,1297721,"I signed the field order.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"213",1297796,1299787,"Why? That's whatI want to know.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"214",1299865,1301856,"All right, I'llspell it for you.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"215",1301933,1305300,"We haven't been penetratingthe concrete in those sub-pens, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"216",1305370,1309170,"We can't get concentrationand accuracy from 19,000.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"217",1309241,1312506,"We've got to go in oncedown low to see if we can
get the job done in one trip...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"218",1312577,1316240,"instead of fighting our wayto the target five times
and back for nothing.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"219",1316315,1318249,"Nine thousand feet.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"220",1318317,1323118,"Let's allow from here in thatwhen the old man cuts a field
order, he's thought about it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"221",1323188,1327147,"There isn't time to take every oneof them apart to see what makes it tick.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"222",1327225,1331093,"If I were you, when I got one,I'd just go ahead and fly it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"223",1331163,1334064,"I was gonna bring thesedown to you tomorrow.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"224",1334132,1336464,"I had to steal themfrom the RAF.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"225",1336535,1338526,"Hope they'rethe kind you wanted.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"226",1338603,1340594,"Yeah.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"227",1342908,1344967,"Yeah, thanks, Frank.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"228",1346712,1350614,"I won't need them at 9,000though. It'll be plenty hot.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"229",1352551,1354610,"Well, I better get on backand get the chores done.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"230",1354686,1357052,"Stay put a minutenow you're here.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"231",1357122,1361024,"Thought I might rundown tomorrow to see you.
How many you expect to put out?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"232",1361093,1363288,"Eighteen.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"233",1363362,1366388,"- Pretty bad luck today?- Not good.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"234",1366465,1369332,"We had one break throughthe runway at takeoff.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"235",1369401,1372234,"That threw us late.We never made it up.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"236",1372304,1375068,"It cost us plenty.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"237",1375140,1377165,"I don't know how anybodyoutguesses that one.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"238",1378677,1381145,"No.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"239",1381213,1384444,"I'd like to help you locatewhere the trouble does lie, if I could.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"240",1384516,1387144,"What about your formation?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"241",1387219,1391781,"I can tell you where the real troubleis, Frank. And it isn't formation.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"242",1391857,1395486,"- Shoot.- It isn't down in the groups either.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"243",1395560,1398552,"It's up here, where a bunch of boysget to be nothing but a set of numbers.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"244",1398630,1400621,"That's what's the trouble.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"245",1400699,1403896,"Do they know up here what my boys havebeen taking for three days in a row?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"246",1403969,1406802,"That they'll be up all nightto get 18 in the air for tomorrow?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"247",1406872,1410208,"How much do you think they can take?You know they're falling
asleep at briefing?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"248",1410342,1413277,"- Are you gonna drive themtill they crack?
- Take it easy, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"249",1413345,1416872,"Take it easy?Bomber Command can take it easy.
Those boys are flesh and blood.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"250",1416948,1419974,"They'll die for you, but they'vegot to have a chance and they
know they haven't got one.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"251",1420051,1423214,"Frank, they can add. They knowa man's chances run out in 15 missions.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"252",1423288,1425654,"Somebody's gotta give them a limit,a goal, some hope of living.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"253",1425724,1428386,"What do you thinkthey're made of?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"254",1428460,1432863,"- Look, Keith.- [Buzzes]","Twelve O'Clock High"
"255",1432898,1436766,"- Yes, sir?- I just got the reports from
the groups. Come on up, Frank.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"256",1436868,1439359,"I'll be there in a minute, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"257",1439438,1441531,"Those things are coming, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"258",1441606,1445201,"Replacements, combat limits.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"259",1445277,1447939,"But right nowthe deal is to hang on.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"260",1448013,1451676,"And look, Keith, you've got to finda way to save yourself a little.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"261",1451750,1455777,"You can't carryall the load. It's too big.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"262",1455854,1459847,"Don't worry about me.If you want something to worry
about, worry about the crews.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"263",1459925,1463258,"You and the old man.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"264",1463328,1466661,"You better go on up and see him.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"265",1466731,1470360,"- Give him my love.- If I do, he'll send you his.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"266",1470435,1473063,"He rates you pretty high.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"267",1473138,1476596,"Not according to Lord Haw-Haw.Good night, Frank.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"268",1502000,1506232,"Never mind the reasons.There it is and you can't
make anything else out of it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"269",1506304,1509330,"Five missing today and they'llonly put up 18 tomorrow.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"270",1509407,1512740,"- It's getting worse instead of better.- Yes, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"271",1512811,1515837,"I've just been talking to Keith.He's low enough about it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"272",1515914,1518474,"What really happened today?Did he tell you?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"273",1518550,1522042,"No, I didn't dig into it.He had tomorrow ahead of him.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"274",1522120,1525453,"What do you make of it?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"275",1525524,1529756,"Hard luck, I guess. There's alwayssome outfit that picks up a jinx.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"276",1529828,1532262,"You don't believe that.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"277",1532330,1534321,"Fill yourself a drink.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"278",1534399,1536424,"Thanks.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"279",1536501,1539368,"It might scare offthat bug of yours.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"280",1543008,1547968,"I don't believe in hard luck.There's always a reason.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"281",1551049,1555315,"What have you got on your mind,Frank? Spill it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"282",1555387,1557321,"I'd rather not.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"283",1558456,1560390,"Let's have itwith the bark on.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"284",1563695,1567859,"You won't like it. I don't.It's the group commander.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"285",1572671,1574730,"Keith?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"286",1574806,1578139,"It's always the group commander.It's his job, isn't it?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"287",1581646,1584581,"A little funny, coming from you.He's your friend.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"288",1584649,1586708,"I didn't ask youto ask me.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"289",1586785,1591245,"- I didn't mean itto sound like that, Frank.
- It's okay.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"290",1591323,1596784,"I don't believe it though.I don't think I do.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"291",1596861,1600922,"On paper, Keith looked to me likethe best group commander we've had.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"292",1600999,1605026,"He's flown every mission. He gets moreloyalty out of his men than anybody.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"293",1605103,1608937,"Courage, he works hard.I don't know where to fault him.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"294",1609007,1611976,"If a man like that can'tcut it, we're in trouble.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"295",1612043,1616139,"- What happened downstairsto change the picture for you?
- Nothing.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"296",1618183,1621380,"Added this to it though.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"297",1621453,1626356,"He's gonna bust wide open.And he's gonna do it to himself too.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"298",1626424,1630554,"Why? Because he'sa first-rate guy.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"299",1630629,1635066,"Because those are his boys and he'sthinking about them instead of missions.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"300",1635133,1638034,"Over-identificationwith his men.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"301",1638103,1640037,"I think that'swhat they call it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"302",1640105,1642767,"And you aren't goingto change it either.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"303",1645510,1649742,"I can't buy it, Frank.Not yet anyway.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"304",1649814,1651748,"Is Keith still here?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"305",1651816,1654080,"No, he had tomorrowto get ready for.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"306",1654152,1656950,"I'll give you that much,we'd better find out.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"307",1657022,1659081,"If it's true, we're in trouble.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"308",1659157,1663491,"Why should the other groups holdtogether if the 918th can't?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"309",1663561,1667122,"Call my car, will you, Frank,while I get my pants on.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"310",1667198,1669257,"You mean you want meto go down there with you?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"311",1669367,1672962,"You bet I do.It's your idea.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"312",1676374,1680276,"We were three minutes lateon the target and got most of it
here on our bombing run.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"313",1680378,1682480,"That was a deadlythree minutes, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"314",1682480,1686177,"The idea was to get all the groupsover the target simultaneously...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"315",1686251,1689482,"so that enemy flak couldn'tconcentrate on any one group.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"316",1689554,1693354,"We sure were sitting ducksout there alone. Maybe I
shouldn't have tried the target.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"317",1693425,1696394,"But we were there andI figured the boys wouldn't want
to bring their loads back home.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"318",1696461,1702161,"No man makes a perfect plan.You couldn't foresee a plane
breaking through the runway.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"319",1702233,1705725,"Maybe the mistake lay in notgoing on to the secondary
target once you were late.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"320",1705804,1708534,"But I figured we could make up the time,catch up with the other groups.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"321",1708606,1712702,"- We could have too if it hadn'tbeen for our stinking luck.
- Luck? What luck was that?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"322",1712777,1715439,"- It wasn't luck, sir. It was my fault.- It wasn't anybody's fault.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"323",1715513,1717981,"- I'd like to hearthe lieutenant's version.
- Yes, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"324",1718049,1723282,"We had to alterthe navigation in flight, sir,
to cross the enemy coast here.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"325",1723354,1725720,"We picked up an error...wind change.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"326",1725790,1729817,"And I missed a checkpointhere at St. Lo.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"327",1729894,1732954,"By the time I had caught it,here at Rennes,","Twelve O'Clock High"
"328",1733031,1736125,"it had cost us three minutesand we never made it up.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"329",1736201,1739830,"If there's any fault, it's mine.I was in command. I ordered
the change in flight plan.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"330",1739904,1743396,"- The weather was thick enough.Could have happened to anyone.
- Well, I think that covers it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"331",1743475,1747571,"Thank you, Lieutenant.Thank you, gentlemen.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"332",1750081,1752015,"- Zimmy.- Yes, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"333",1752083,1756042,"It's okay.Don't worry about a thing.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"334",1763528,1766429,"Keith, I know you're tired,but let's talk a little.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"335",1766498,1768659,"Sit down.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"336",1769901,1772335,"Let's talk about luck.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"337",1775974,1778499,"A pretty criticalthree minutes, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"338",1778576,1781875,"- Five crews, 50 men.- Do you think I don't know?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"339",1781946,1784676,"- I know you do.Whose fault was it, Keith?
- Primarily it was mine.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"340",1784749,1786683,"- Were you flying?- Yes, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"341",1786751,1790084,"- Do you fly and navigate ordo you rely on your navigator?
- You have to, but...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"342",1790155,1793056,"- It was the lieutenant's fault.- He missed the check point, but
it could've happened to anyone.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"343",1793124,1797788,"I know and I'll allowhe feels as rotten about it
as any of us do, more so maybe.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"344",1797862,1800387,"But what happens now, Keith?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"345",1800465,1802956,"I don't understand you, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"346",1804435,1808269,"We're talking about luck.I don't believe in it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"347",1808339,1811570,"I believe that to some degreea man makes his own luck.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"348",1811643,1814942,"Yours has been pretty bad down hereand it's getting worse, not better.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"349",1815013,1820280,"Maybe the navigator's in point.He blew it. What are you going
to do about it?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"350",1820351,1824481,"General, I don't believe in chopping offheads because of one mistake.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"351",1824556,1827650,"Well, I just don't thinkthat's any way to run a group.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"352",1830195,1833426,"I feel sorryfor the boy, Keith.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"353",1833498,1837798,"But what are the men in yourgroup going to be thinking about
the next mission he navigates?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"354",1837869,1840360,"That he messed upthe St. Nazaire mission.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"355",1840438,1844204,"It's just that much more loadon them. And one day, if they
fall apart, that won't be luck.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"356",1844275,1846971,"There isn't a man in the outfitwho wouldn't stake his life on Zimmy.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"357",1847045,1851448,"General, if it was anyonebut him. He's got two strikes
against him to begin with.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"358",1851516,1854542,"You don't realize. That boy'sgot a persecution complex.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"359",1854619,1856814,"He wants to fly every missiontrying to live down the fact...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"360",1856888,1859755,"that his parents were mixed upin the German-American Bund.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"361",1859824,1863055,"They screened Zimmy plentybefore he ever got overseas.
That's what's riding him now.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"362",1863127,1868326,"Keith, good navigatorsis the one thing we're not short of.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"363",1868399,1873371,"If you decide that you oughtto relieve this boy, I'll
give you a good replacement.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"364",1875506,1879340,"You might as well ask meto stand him up against the wall
and shoot him in the back.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"365",1879410,1883779,"No, I won't do it, sir. I justcan't do it to him. I won't.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"366",1889687,1891848,"Keith, I want youto get to bed.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"367",1891923,1896758,"Have the flight surgeon give you a shotthat will make you sleep 24 hours.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"368",1896828,1900889,"I guess a man only has so much to giveand I guess you've given it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"369",1903234,1905168,"Effective now, you arerelieved of this command...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"370",1905236,1907932,"and you will report to mefor duty at Bomber Command.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"371",1908006,1910600,"I'll send someone downto take over here.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"372",1910675,1913803,"- Good night, Keith.- Good night, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"373",1923655,1927250,"Major, the 918th will stand downuntil a new commanding officer arrives.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"374",1927325,1929759,"Yes, sir.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"375",1933197,1935256,"[Door Shuts]","Twelve O'Clock High"
"376",1975039,1978600,"- Want me to take it, sir?- No.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"377",1982380,1985042,"I want to talk, Frank.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"378",1992590,1997653,"There's a hole in the dike, Frank.I'm scared stiff.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"379",1999364,2003562,"Maybe you know how deepall this goes, and maybe you don't.","Twelve O'Clock High"

"600",3296259,3299023,"as to how muchstress they can take.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"601",3299095,3303054,"If a man is physically capableof handling his airplane, he goes.","Twelve O'Clock High"

"659",3560757,3563555,"I had my shot at combatin the first war.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"660",3563626,3565594,"Of course I kind of wantedto get into this one,","Twelve O'Clock High"

"674",3623152,3625177,"I think I'm a good one.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"675",3625254,3627415,"And when a good lawyer takes ona client, he does it because...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"676",3627490,3631449,"he believes in the client's case,and that's all that matters.","Twelve O'Clock High"

"681",3642872,3648139,"- On the button.- What did you have in mind exactly?","Twelve O'Clock High"
"682",3648211,3651942,"I need time beforethose transfers go through.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"683",3652015,3654813,"- Mm-hmm. How much time?- As much as we can get.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"684",3654884,3657114,"Ten days, anyway.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"685",3657186,3660485,"Well, it'll take thosesquadron adjutants...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"686",3660556,3663855,"at least two daysto draw up all those requests.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"687",3663926,3666759,"And, let's see...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"688",3666829,3670526,"I believe in thorough, methodical work,everything in order.","Twelve O'Clock High"

"691",3676439,3679772,"- That's five.- Take a couple of days to check them.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"692",3679842,3683209,"That's seven.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"693",3683279,3686339,"And those squadron adjutantsare pretty sloppy sometimes,","Twelve O'Clock High"
"694",3686449,3690408,"and I certainly don't want this groupcriticized for sloppy paperwork.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"695",3690486,3692454,"- Do you, General?- Couldn't permit it.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"696",3692555,3694785,"So my guess isevery one of those requests...","Twelve O'Clock High"
"697",3694857,3697451,"may have to go back to the squadronadjutants to be done over.","Twelve O'Clock High"
"698",3697527,3699654,"By the time I recheck them,","Twelve O'Clock High"
"699",3699729,3703529,"it'll be ten days anyway beforethey can be ready for signature.","Twelve O'Clock High"

came out, where'd she go?","Harvey"
"431",1674160,1677240,"She's picking some posies.She wants to bring 'em
to somebody inside.","Harvey"

"433",1679680,1682720,"I don't see no barson these windows.
Don't need 'em.","Harvey"
"434",1682799,1686839,"Anybody tries to climbthrough those windows will sound
like a three-alarm fire.","Harvey"
"435",1688839,1692440,"Hello, sweetheart.Well, well. Those for me?","Harvey"
"436",1692519,1695440,"For you? I should say not.They're for
my brother Elwood.","Harvey"
"437",1695519,1698160,"He's devotedto ranunculus.
Sure.","Harvey"
"438",1698240,1701400,"Wouldn't you liketo come inside and pick some
off the wallpaper?","Harvey"
"439",1701440,1703799,"No, thank you.These will do nicely.
Good day.","Harvey"

"443",1714920,1717799,"What do we want withthe police, love boat?
They're no fun.","Harvey"
"444",1717880,1721279,"You let me go!I'm a respectable woman!
That's for sure.","Harvey"
"445",1721359,1724799,"Come on, lady, be niceor I'll have to pick you up
and carry you.","Harvey"
"446",1724839,1728559,"[Veta Screaming]Help!","Harvey"
"447",1738559,1740880,"Oh, Dr. Sanderson!Judge Gaffney!","Harvey"
"448",1740960,1743400,"How about giving me a hand,beautiful?","Harvey"
"449",1743480,1745680,"I'll sit on her.You can strip her clothes off.","Harvey"
"450",1745759,1748480,"You'll have to wait.I've got to give
some guy a bubble bath.","Harvey"
"451",1748559,1750920,"Okay, honey,but make it snappy.","Harvey"
"452",1751000,1754559,"[Crying]Somebody help me!","Harvey"
"453",1767519,1772319,"Doc, that Simmons dame'sall set.
Yeah, no trouble at all.","Harvey"
"454",1772519,1776119,"That's fine.I'll be right up and prescribe
some preliminary treatment.","Harvey"
"455",1776200,1779960,"Don't you ever stayin your office? I needed you!
I had to give a hypo.","Harvey"
"456",1780039,1783480,"Telephone this Elwood P. Dowdright away. His sister's
condition is serious.","Harvey"
"457",1783559,1786559,"But, Doctor, l...He'll have to sign these
commitment papers for her.","Harvey"
"458",1786599,1789319,"I didn't know the womanneeded the treatment.
She said it was her brother.","Harvey"
"459",1789359,1791480,"Of course she did!That's the oldest dodge
in the world.","Harvey"
"460",1791559,1793559,"Always used bya cunning type of psychopath.","Harvey"
"461",1793640,1796559,"She knew her brother was aboutto commit her, so she came here
to discredit him.","Harvey"
"462",1796599,1800000,"Get him on the phone,please.
I thought the woman
was all right...","Harvey"
"463",1800079,1803839,"so I had Wilson takethe brother up
to 24 South Wing G.","Harvey"
"464",1803920,1806759,"He's there now.You had Wilson take
the brother in?","Harvey"
"465",1806839,1809920,"Come on, no gags, please.You're not serious, are you?","Harvey"
"466",1810000,1815000,"I did, Doctor. I did.Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.","Harvey"
"467",1815079,1818720,"Oh, you're terribly sorry!Well, that's fine!
That fixes everything!","Harvey"
"468",1818799,1820799,"That's just wonderful!","Harvey"
"469",1820880,1825960,"Oh, no! Kelly!Kelly, do you realize
what you've done?","Harvey"
"470",1826039,1829880,"This man Dowd can sue usfor false commitment!
He can own the sanitarium!","Harvey"
"471",1829960,1833640,"And I'll be kicked outta herefaster than you can say stupid,
incompetent and inefficient.","Harvey"
"472",1833799,1837000,"I'll tell Dr. Chumleyyou had nothing to do with it.
It was all my fault.","Harvey"
"473",1837079,1840039,"You're the last personI'd ever want anything
like this to happen to.","Harvey"
"474",1840119,1842079,"You know that,don't you?","Harvey"
"475",1842160,1846039,"This is hardly the time or placeto go into the balcony scene
from Romeo and Juliet.","Harvey"
"476",1846119,1848480,"Lately, Doctor, there'snever any time or place!","Harvey"
"477",1848559,1852119,"Jeepers! They may be puttinghim in the hydro room right now.
Get him down!","Harvey"
"478",1852160,1854599,"I'll break the newsto Dr. Chumley.
He may want to handle this.","Harvey"
"479",1854680,1856680,"What shall I say to Mr. Dowd?What'll I do?","Harvey"
"480",1856759,1859359,"He'll probably be so furioushe'll refuse to come down.","Harvey"
"481",1859440,1862359,"He's probably fit to be tied,but he's a man, isn't he?","Harvey"
"482",1862440,1864759,"I guess so.His name is Mister.","Harvey"
"483",1864839,1868640,"Then go into your routine.You know, the eyes,
the swish, the works!","Harvey"
"484",1868680,1871480,"I'm immune to it, but I'veseen it work on some people.
Some of the patients!","Harvey"
"485",1871559,1874640,"You get him down hereif you have to do a striptease.","Harvey"
"486",1874720,1878240,"Dr. Chumley,I'm afraid there's been
a serious error.","Harvey"
"487",1878319,1882119,"Dr. Sanderson,we don't permit errors
in this institution.","Harvey"
"488",1891039,1893000,"Mr. Dowd?","Harvey"
"489",1894240,1897519,"Elwood P. Here, let megive you one of my cards.","Harvey"
"490",1897599,1900920,"Mr. Dowd, I'm Miss Kelly.I'm at the reception desk
downstairs.","Harvey"
"491",1901000,1903759,"I'm happy to know you,Miss Kelly.
Thank you, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"492",1903839,1907480,"I was wondering if you wouldcome downstairs with me
to Dr. Sanderson's office.","Harvey"
"493",1907559,1911480,"There's something he'd liketo explain to you.
Uh-huh. I'd be glad to.","Harvey"
"494",1911519,1916359,"But there was anothervery charming girl in here.
And she asked me to wait.","Harvey"
"495",1916440,1918519,"She said somethingabout a bath.","Harvey"
"496",1918559,1923000,"I don't like to disappoint her.She seemed to have
her heart set on it.","Harvey"
"497",1923079,1925440,"That was Miss Dunphy.It's quite all right, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"498",1925519,1928079,"Dr. Sanderson will explaineverything in his office.
Well, here we are.","Harvey"
"499",1928160,1930279,"Tsk-tsk. Mr. Dowd,you haven't peeled yet.","Harvey"
"500",1930359,1935400,"And I regret this,but Miss Kelly seems
to want me to go with her.","Harvey"
"501",1935480,1938400,"Miss Kelly,you've met Miss Dunphy?
Yes, of course.","Harvey"
"502",1938480,1943119,"I want you to meet a very dear...There's been a mistake.
Just forget everything.","Harvey"
"503",1943200,1948720,"I have a suggestion.Why don't I do what she wants,
and then go with you?","Harvey"
"504",1948799,1953039,"That won't be necessary,Mr. Dowd.
All right. Good-bye, my dear.","Harvey"
"505",1953119,1955759,"You could've hada bath too.","Harvey"
"506",1955839,1960640,"I've already had a bath.Oh, I wasn't speaking to you.
I was speaking to my fr...","Harvey"
"507",1960720,1966039,"Mr. Dowd,I take a bath every morning
just before I go on duty.","Harvey"
"508",1966079,1969680,"It's always such a pleasant wayto start the day.","Harvey"
"509",1970480,1972920,"Oh, after you.","Harvey"
"510",1982079,1984880,"Mr. Dowd?Elwood P.","Harvey"
"511",1984960,1987640,"Let me give you oneof my cards.","Harvey"
"512",1987720,1990720,"I am Dr. Lyman Sanderson,Dr. Chumley's assistant.
And l...","Harvey"
"513",1990799,1994160,"Good for you!Happy to know you.
Yes.","Harvey"
"514",1994240,1998279,"I asked Miss Kellyto bring you down here...
Isn't she lovely?","Harvey"
"515",1998359,2000640,"You're very lovely,my dear.","Harvey"
"516",2000720,2005000,"Why thank you!Some people don't seem
to think so.","Harvey"
"517",2005079,2008200,"Well, some people are blind.That's very often brought
to my attention.","Harvey"
"518",2008279,2011720,"I'd like both of you to meeta very dear friend of mine...
Why can't we sit down?","Harvey"
"519",2011799,2015039,"Won't you have a chair?Well, thank you
very much.","Harvey"
"520",2015119,2018000,"There we are.","Harvey"
"521",2018079,2020119,"Please, sit down.After Miss Kelly.","Harvey"
"522",2020160,2024799,"No, really, Mr. Dowd.I couldn't. I'm in and out.
But you sit down, please.","Harvey"
"523",2024880,2027640,"After you.Sit down, Kelly!","Harvey"
"524",2031000,2034079,"Anything we can do for you,Mr. Dowd?
What did you
have in mind?","Harvey"
"525",2034160,2037880,"Is your chair comfortable?Is the chair
quite comfortable, Mr. Dowd?","Harvey"
"526",2037960,2041400,"Yes. Care to try it?No, no, no, thank you.
How 'bout a cigarette?","Harvey"
"527",2041480,2044200,"No, thank you.Yes, a cigarette...","Harvey"
"528",2045920,2049119,"Mr. Dowd, you have usat a disadvantage here.","Harvey"
"529",2049159,2052639,"You know it and we know it,so let's lay our cards
on the table.","Harvey"
"530",2052719,2054639,"That appealsto me, Doctor.","Harvey"
"531",2054719,2058840,"Best thing in the long run.People are people
no matter where you go.","Harvey"
"532",2058920,2061000,"That is very oftenthe case.","Harvey"
"533",2061079,2064079,"And being human,are liable to make mistakes.","Harvey"
"534",2064159,2069000,"Miss Kelly and I, we've madea mistake this afternoon
and we'd like to explain it.","Harvey"
"535",2069079,2072360,"The truth is...You and
Miss Kelly here?","Harvey"
"536",2072440,2074440,"Yes.","Harvey"
"537",2074480,2077480,"Out herethis afternoon?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"538",2077519,2080719,"We hopeyou'll understand.
Oh, yes, yes.","Harvey"
"539",2080800,2084679,"These things are oftenthe basis of a very long,
warm friendship.","Harvey"
"540",2084760,2087719,"It wasn't Dr. Sanderson'sfault. It was mine.","Harvey"
"541",2087800,2090320,"No, the responsibilityis all mine!","Harvey"
"542",2090400,2095519,"Your attitudemay be old-fashioned,
but I like it very much.","Harvey"
"543",2097519,2099880,"Of course, If I had seenyour sister first,","Harvey"
"544",2099960,2103039,"this would've beenan entirely different story.","Harvey"
"545",2103119,2105079,"There you surprise me.","Harvey"
"546",2105159,2108960,"I think the world and allof Veta, but I had supposed
she'd seen her day.","Harvey"
"547",2109039,2113920,"You mustn't attachtoo much blame to her.
She's a very sick woman.","Harvey"
"548",2114000,2118320,"She came in here insistingthat you needed treatment.
That's perfectly ridiculous.","Harvey"
"549",2118360,2121639,"Veta shouldn't be upsetabout me.
I get along fine.","Harvey"
"550",2121719,2125760,"She was extremely upset andplunged right away into a heated
tirade about your drinking.","Harvey"
"551",2125800,2128599,"Ahh!That was Veta.","Harvey"
"552",2128639,2132599,"I tell Veta not to worryabout that.
I'll take care of that.","Harvey"
"553",2132639,2135800,"Exactly! Oh, I supposethat you take a drink now
and then like the rest of us.","Harvey"
"554",2135880,2138760,"M-M-M-M...","Harvey"
"555",2140159,2142199,"Yes, yes I do, Doctor.","Harvey"
"556",2142280,2145800,"As a matter of fact,I'd like one right now.","Harvey"
"557",2145880,2148719,"As a matter of fact,so would I.","Harvey"
"558",2148760,2151920,"But her reactionto the whole matter
was entirely too intense.","Harvey"
"559",2152000,2153960,"Does she drink, Mr. Dowd?","Harvey"
"560",2154039,2158679,"Oh, no, oh, no.I don't think Veta's
ever taken a drink.","Harvey"
"561",2158760,2162000,"I am going to surprise you.I think she has
and does constantly.","Harvey"
"562",2162039,2165360,"She... Is that...","Harvey"
"563",2165440,2169760,"Well, I certainlyam surprised at that.","Harvey"
"564",2169840,2173400,"Her alcoholism isn'tthe basis for my diagnosis.","Harvey"
"565",2173480,2178400,"It was whenshe became so emotional about
this big white rabbit Harvey.","Harvey"
"566",2178480,2182400,"Yes, I believeshe called him Harvey.
Harvey's his name!","Harvey"
"567",2182480,2185639,"Doctor, before we goany further,
I must insist...","Harvey"
"568",2185719,2187920,"that you and Miss Kellyallow me to introduce you
to a friend...","Harvey"
"569",2188000,2190239,"Let me make my point.","Harvey"
"570",2190320,2194039,"I think your sister's conditionstems from trauma.","Harvey"
"571",2194119,2197639,"From what?Trauma.
Spelled T-R-A-U-M-A.","Harvey"
"572",2197719,2200119,"It means shock.There's nothing unusual
about it.","Harvey"
"573",2200199,2202760,"There's the birth trauma,or the shock of being born.","Harvey"
"574",2202920,2206760,"That's the oneWe never get over.
[Both Laughing]","Harvey"
"575",2206840,2210920,"You have a very nice sense ofhumor. Hasn't he, Miss Kelly?
Oh, he certainly has!","Harvey"
"576",2211000,2213679,"May I say the samefor both of you?","Harvey"
"577",2213760,2217960,"Your sister's conditionis serious,
but I can help her.","Harvey"
"578",2218039,2220239,"She must, however, remainout here temporarily.","Harvey"
"579",2220320,2224320,"Uh-huh. Well, I've alwayswanted Veta to have everything
she needs.
Exactly!","Harvey"
"580",2224400,2228239,"But I wouldn't want herto stay here unless she likes it
and wants to stay here.","Harvey"
"581",2228320,2232639,"If this were an ordinarydelusion on the memory picture,
that would be one thing.","Harvey"
"582",2232679,2234679,"But this ismuch more serious.","Harvey"
"583",2234719,2238679,"It stands to reasonno one has ever seen a
white rabbit six feet high.","Harvey"
"584",2238719,2240880,"Not very often,Doctor.","Harvey"
"585",2240920,2243000,"So she must be committedhere temporarily.","Harvey"
"586",2243079,2245719,"Under the circumstances,I'd commit
my own grandmother.","Harvey"
"587",2245800,2248079,"Does your grandmotherdrink too?","Harvey"
"588",2248159,2251360,"That's just an expression.","Harvey"
"589",2251440,2254639,"Here are the commitmentpapers for you to sign,
and here's a visitor's pass.","Harvey"
"590",2254719,2256679,"You can come and see herwhenever you like.","Harvey"
"591",2256760,2259559,"I think you betterhave Veta do this.","Harvey"
"592",2259639,2263280,"She always does all the signingand managing for our family.
She's good at it.","Harvey"
"593",2263360,2266480,"I'll have your familylawyer take care of it.
Judge Gaffney.","Harvey"
"594",2266559,2268639,"He's already telephoned usin connection
with this matter.","Harvey"
"595",2268719,2270719,"Is that so?Yes.","Harvey"
"596",2270800,2274119,"I like you, Dowd.Well, I like you too,
Doctor.","Harvey"
"597",2274159,2277280,"And Miss Kelly here.I certainly do like you.","Harvey"
"598",2277360,2280119,"Why, thank you,Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"599",2280159,2284400,"You two have been so pleasant,why don't we keep on going?","Harvey"
"600",2284480,2287119,"I'd like to invite youto come downtown with me...","Harvey"
"601",2287199,2290599,"and we'll go to this charminglittle place called Charlie's
and we'll have a drink.","Harvey"
"602",2290639,2293719,"Oh, I'm sorry,but we're on duty now.","Harvey"
"603",2293800,2296559,"Give us a rain check.Some other time,
we'd be glad to.","Harvey"
"604",2296639,2300440,"When?Well, I can't say
offhand.","Harvey"
"605",2300480,2302639,"Miss Kelly and I areon duty until 10:00 tonight.","Harvey"
"606",2302719,2306119,"10:00 will be fine.I'll be waiting for you.
It's at Twelfth and Main.","Harvey"
"607",2306159,2308360,"If we can make it.I'll be waiting.","Harvey"
"608",2308440,2311800,"The four of us will spenda very pleasant evening
together.","Harvey"
"609",2311880,2315039,"I want both of youto become friends with
a very dear friend of mine.","Harvey"
"610",2315119,2316840,"But you said later on,didn't you?
Yes, yes.","Harvey"
"611",2316920,2320639,"Later on it'll be.Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"612",2329440,2331679,"Boy, that wasa close shave!","Harvey"
"613",2331760,2334519,"But he seemedlike a reasonable
sort of a fellow.","Harvey"
"614",2334599,2337280,"You handled himbeautifully, Doctor.
You were wonderful.","Harvey"
"615",2337320,2340199,"Psychology.Specialized training.
Takes years of it.","Harvey"
"616",2345039,2349039,"Good afternoon,Mrs. Chumley.
Good afternoon, Herman.","Harvey"
"617",2352079,2355280,"Oh, stop the cara moment, Wesley.","Harvey"
"618",2355360,2357039,"Yoo-hoo!","Harvey"
"619",2357119,2360039,"Yoo-hoo!","Harvey"
"620",2364719,2368719,"Is there somethingI can do for you?
What did you have in mind?","Harvey"
"621",2368800,2373639,"You were walking onmy husband's prized dahlias.
I'm Dr. Chumley's wife.","Harvey"
"622",2373719,2378559,"Oh, Dowd's my name.Elwood P.
Let me give you...","Harvey"
"623",2378599,2382239,"Looking for someoneover there?
Yes. My friend Harvey.","Harvey"
"624",2382320,2385280,"I turned my back for an instantand he seems

"651",2476800,2480800,"I don't know. I gave uplong ago expecting my family
to like my friends.","Harvey"
"652",2480880,2483440,"It's useless!We must keep on trying,

"694",2641440,2646079,"Two holes cut in the crown.It's probably some new fad.","Harvey"

Dowd?","Harvey"
"696",2648239,2651519,"Yes, that's what I was...That's Mrs. Simmons' brother.
I gave him a pass.","Harvey"

in a hydro tub!","Harvey"

"707",2684599,2686800,"So you gave him a pass!","Harvey"
"708",2686880,2690559,"Perhaps they neglectedto tell you at medical school
that a rabbit has pointed ears!","Harvey"
"709",2690639,2692599,"Do you know whatyou've done?","Harvey"
"710",2692639,2696480,"You've allowed a psychopathiccase to roam around with

for 15 years.","Harvey"
"713",2701119,2703320,"I'll have to go afterthis man, Dowd,
and bring him back!","Harvey"
"714",2703400,2708000,"But when I do, Dr. Sanderson,your connection with this
institution will have ended.","Harvey"
"715",2708079,2711920,"Wilson, get the car.You'll have to go to
the McClure's without me.","Harvey"

She's hysterical.","Harvey"
"747",2842480,2845880,"Where's your phone?In the library. What was
Mother hysterical about?","Harvey"
"748",2845920,2848119,"I don't know.I couldn't make out
what she was talking about.","Harvey"

had to carry on about.","Harvey"
"751",2853960,2856800,"All she had to do was haveUncle Elwood locked up.
Maybe that's it.","Harvey"
"752",2856880,2860840,"I feel bad about havin'Elwood locked up.
I always liked that boy.","Harvey"
"753",2860920,2864480,"He could've done anything,been anything, made a place

"772",2928280,2932840,"What's this?As I was going to the taxi cab
to get Elwood's things,","Harvey"
"773",2932920,2937440,"this awful man stepped out,he was a white slaver,
I know he was.","Harvey"
"774",2937519,2940719,"He was wearing oneof those white suits.
That's how they advertise.","Harvey"
"775",2940800,2945960,"What did he do?He grabbed hold of me

I'll sue them for this!","Harvey"
"784",2972199,2975360,"I always thoughtthat what you were

"785",2975440,2978000,"Don't you believe it, Judge,Myrtle Mae.","Harvey"
"786",2978079,2982039,"That man grabbed hold of meas though I was a woman
of the streets.","Harvey"

jumped at me, I'd fight.","Harvey"

think about sex?","Harvey"
"801",3026920,3030440,"I don't know.Because if it is, they ought
to be ashamed of themselves.","Harvey"
"802",3030519,3032519,"It's allin their heads anyway.","Harvey"
"803",3032599,3036480,"Why don't they takelong walks

They're always liars.","Harvey"
"809",3055360,3059880,"Besides, I told him somethingin strictest confidence
and he blabbed it.","Harvey"
"810",3059960,3062000,"You can't trust anyone!","Harvey"
"811",3062079,3065519,"What did you tell him?What difference
does it make?","Harvey"
"812",3065559,3071000,"I don't want to think about it.I don't want to talk about it.","Harvey"

Don't be so naive.","Harvey"
"822",3101119,3105280,"Mother, no matter who jumpedat you, we still have to find

in the back booth.","Harvey"
"1017",3851599,3854440,"Is he alone?Well, there's two schools
of thought, sir.","Harvey"
"1018",3854519,3857639,"If that crackpot did anythingto Dr. Chumley,
I'll knock his teeth...","Harvey"
"1019",3857719,3860039,"No rough stuff.Psychology.
I'll do the talking.","Harvey"
"1020",3860119,3862920,"Well, I've beenexpecting you.
Where's the Doctor?","Harvey"
"1021",3862960,3867159,"Wilson! Why don't youtake a look around the place?","Harvey"
"1022",3867199,3871519,"Why don't you do that?Although I don't believe
it's for sale.","Harvey"
"1023",3871599,3875280,"Miss Kelly,these are for you.","Harvey"
"1024",3875360,3878719,"Why, thank you,Mr. Dowd!
A pleasure,
my dear.","Harvey"
"1025",3878800,3884039,"You know, after what happenedthis afternoon, these flowers
really should be from you.","Harvey"
"1026",3884079,3887400,"Now, won't you join me?Mr. Dowd,
I'm afraid we can't do that.","Harvey"
"1027",3887480,3890920,"The situation has changedsince this afternoon, but I
urge you to have no resentment.","Harvey"
"1028",3890960,3894400,"Dr. Chumley is your friendand he only wants to help you.
Isn't that nice!","Harvey"
"1029",3894480,3898000,"I'd be glad to help him.We all must face reality, Dowd,
sooner or later.","Harvey"
"1030",3898079,3902800,"Uh-huh. Well,I wrestled with reality
for 35 years, Doctor.","Harvey"
"1031",3902880,3906400,"And I'm happy to stateI finally won out over it.","Harvey"
"1032",3906480,3908519,"Mr. Dowd,where is Dr. Chumley?","Harvey"
"1033",3908599,3911559,"Not knowing,I cannot say.
Wish I could.","Harvey"
"1034",3911639,3915599,"Miss Kelly, I don't liketo see you standing.
Sit down, Kelly.","Harvey"
"1035",3917440,3921440,"There we are.Now, let's all
have a drink.","Harvey"
"1036",3921519,3923800,"Dr. Chumley did come in hereto get you
earlier this evening?","Harvey"
"1037",3923880,3926519,"Yes, he did.And I was delighted
to see him.","Harvey"
"1038",3926559,3929159,"What'll it be,Mr. Dowd?
Martinis?","Harvey"
"1039",3929239,3934119,"- But that was four hours ago.- Where has the evening gone?","Harvey"
"1040",3934199,3939000,"Four...Three martinis,
Mr. Cracker.","Harvey"
"1041",3939039,3941559,"I've looked all over this joint.There's no sign of the Doctor.
What'd you do to him?","Harvey"
"1042",3941639,3943599,"We're trying to find out.What happened then?","Harvey"
"1043",3943679,3948519,"I introduced Harveyto the Doctor,
and he sat down with us.","Harvey"
"1044",3948599,3950639,"Harvey was sitting here,","Harvey"
"1045",3950719,3954880,"and the Doctorsat opposite Harvey
so he could look at him.","Harvey"
"1046",3954920,3958000,"Who's Harvey?A white rabbit,
six feet tall.","Harvey"
"1047",3958079,3962119,"- Six feet?- Six feet, three and a half
inches. Let's stick to facts.","Harvey"
"1048",3962199,3964679,"What happened after youintroduced Dr. Chumley
to Harvey?","Harvey"
"1049",3964760,3967559,"Harvey suggested thatI buy him a drink.","Harvey"
"1050",3967599,3971400,"Knowing that he doesn't liketo drink alone, I suggested
to Dr. Chumley we join him.","Harvey"
"1051",3971440,3973159,"We joined him.","Harvey"
"1052",3973239,3974880,"Go on.Wejoined him again.","Harvey"
"1053",3974960,3978519,"- Then what?- Then the other matter came up.","Harvey"
"1054",3978599,3980880,"Now we're gettin' somewhere.What other matter?","Harvey"
"1055",3980960,3984840,"Eh...Mr. Wilson, I don't like
to see you standing.","Harvey"
"1056",3984880,3987079,"Wouldn't youjoin us here?
Who, me?","Harvey"
"1057",3987159,3990119,"Sit down,will you, Wilson?
Sit right down.","Harvey"
"1058",3990159,3992519,"You say this other mattercame up, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"1059",3992559,3996679,"Yes. There wasa beautiful blonde woman
name of Mrs. Smethills...","Harvey"
"1060",3996760,4000559,"and her escortseated in the booth
directly across from us.","Harvey"
"1061",4000639,4004760,"Dr. Chumley went overto sit next to her,
explaining to her...","Harvey"
"1062",4004800,4009039,"that they had once met...in Chicago.","Harvey"
"1063",4009119,4012599,"Then her escortescorted Dr. Chumley...","Harvey"
"1064",4012679,4015239,"back hereto Harvey and me,","Harvey"
"1065",4015320,4018440,"and tried to point outthat it would be better
for Dr. Chumley...","Harvey"
"1066",4018519,4021119,"to mindhis own affairs.","Harvey"
"1067",4021199,4023159,"Does he have any?Does he have
any what?","Harvey"
"1068",4023239,4026159,"Any affairs?How would I know?
Shut up!","Harvey"
"1069",4026239,4030960,"Go on, Mr. Dowd.Well...
Thank you, Mr. Cracker.","Harvey"
"1070",4031000,4036360,"Mrs. Smethills' escortseemed to get more depressed as
he kept looking at Dr. Chumley.","Harvey"
"1071",4036400,4039679,"So Harvey and I feltwe should take the Doctor
somewhere else.","Harvey"
"1072",4039760,4042719,"Harvey suggestedBlondie's Chicken Inn,","Harvey"
"1073",4042800,4045119,"but the Doctorwanted to go to Eddie's.","Harvey"
"1074",4045199,4049400,"And while they were arguingabout it, I went up to the bar
to order another drink.","Harvey"
"1075",4049519,4051840,"When I came back here,they were gone.","Harvey"
"1076",4051920,4055800,"You don't believe that storyabout the Doctor talking
to a big white rabbit, do you?","Harvey"
"1077",4055880,4058239,"Why not?Harvey was here.","Harvey"
"1078",4058320,4061800,"At first Dr. Chumley seemedfrightened of Harvey,","Harvey"
"1079",4061880,4065519,"but that gave wayto admiration
as the evening wore on.","Harvey"
"1080",4067280,4069440,"The evening wore on.","Harvey"
"1081",4069519,4072039,"That's avery nice expression,
isn't it?","Harvey"
"1082",4072119,4075639,"With your permission,I'll say it again.","Harvey"
"1083",4075719,4077840,"The evening wore on.","Harvey"
"1084",4077920,4081239,"And with your permissionI'm gonna knock your brains out.","Harvey"
"1085",4081320,4085000,"Look, you did somethingto Dr. Chumley, and I'm gonna
find out what it is.","Harvey"
"1086",4085079,4088760,"[Kelly]Stop! Lyman! Wilson!
For heaven's sake!","Harvey"
"1087",4096600,4098560,"Get outside!Mr. Cracker?","Harvey"
"1088",4098640,4102640,"Sure, Mr. Dowd.Mr. Cracker,
may I intercede for my friends?","Harvey"
"1089",4102720,4107000,"Youth and high spirits.Time will take care of that.
Sure, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"1090",4107079,4109399,"Okay, boys,let 'em go.","Harvey"
"1091",4109479,4113880,"If Mr. Dowd vouches for you,okay. One more peep out of you
and I'll butter your necktie.","Harvey"
"1092",4113920,4115800,"Yeah, fine.Get back
to your dancing.","Harvey"
"1093",4115880,4119119,"Stimulating as all this is,I think we all should have
our drinks.","Harvey"
"1094",4119199,4121000,"Here, Miss Kelly,sit down.","Harvey"
"1095",4121079,4123479,"Here We are.Dr. Sanderson.","Harvey"
"1096",4125359,4129319,"You keep your eye on him.I'm gonna check
in those other two joints.","Harvey"
"1097",4129399,4132319,"And Dr. Chumleybetter be there, pal...
or else!","Harvey"
"1098",4132399,4134560,"Mr. Wilson?Yeah?","Harvey"
"1099",4134640,4138600,"Good-bye, Mr. Wilson.My regards to you and anybody
else you happen to run into.","Harvey"
"1100",4138640,4142079,"Ah, you...","Harvey"
"1101",4142159,4147000,"Mr. Dowd, can't you thinkof anything else that might
help us to find the Doctor?","Harvey"
"1102",4147079,4151640,"Miss Kelly, may Itake hold of your hand?","Harvey"
"1103",4151720,4154800,"Yes, Mr. Dowd,if you want to.","Harvey"
"1104",4154880,4159039,"We're all so worried.Please try to think.
Please?","Harvey"
"1105",4159119,4164720,"For you I'd do anything.I'd almost be willing
to live my life over again.","Harvey"
"1106",4164800,4168079,"Almost.But I've told it all.","Harvey"
"1107",4168159,4170720,"You're sure?I'm quite sure.","Harvey"
"1108",4170800,4172760,"But ask me again anyway,Won't you?","Harvey"
"1109",4172840,4177600,"I liked that warm toneyou had in your voice
just then.","Harvey"
"1110",4177680,4180199,"So did I.","Harvey"
"1111",4180279,4184199,"Maybe we better gosomeplace else. Miss Kelly
seems to be unhappy.","Harvey"
"1112",4184279,4187359,"No, let's stay here.Kelly's all right.","Harvey"
"1113",4187439,4190359,"Perhaps you'd liketo dance, Miss Kelly.","Harvey"
"1114",4190439,4194079,"All right, Mr. Dowd,if you'd like to.
Oh, not I! No.","Harvey"
"1115",4194159,4197520,"I used to dance.I haven't danced in years.","Harvey"
"1116",4197600,4201960,"I'm sure Dr. Sandersonwould love to dance with
somebody as lovely as you.","Harvey"
"1117",4202039,4206159,"Hmm?Would you,
Miss Kelly?","Harvey"
"1118",4206239,4208840,"All right.There we are.","Harvey"
"1119",4231880,4235319,"It's been a long timesince we've danced together.","Harvey"
"1120",4235399,4238560,"Yes, a long time.","Harvey"
"1121",4238640,4241119,"I'd forgotten whata wonderful dancer you were.","Harvey"
"1122",4241199,4245359,"If we didn't have to humorMr. Dowd, you wouldn't
have remembered at all.","Harvey"
"1123",4245439,4248880,"I'm not dancing with youto humor Mr. Dowd, Ruth.","Harvey"
"1124",4259039,4260800,"We shouldn'thave left him alone!","Harvey"
"1125",4264479,4267000,"Where are you goin',Mr. Dowd?","Harvey"
"1126",4267079,4269039,"I was just lookingfor someone.","Harvey"
"1127",4269079,4273920,"Why don't you come back inside?All right,
if you want me to.","Harvey"
"1128",4274000,4277079,"It seemed to be so pleasantout here.","Harvey"
"1129",4277159,4281199,"You know,you two look very nice
dancing together.","Harvey"
"1130",4281279,4285319,"I used to knowa whole lot of dances.","Harvey"
"1131",4285399,4288159,"The Flea Hop.","Harvey"
"1132",4288239,4290640,"And what's the...[Fingers Snapping]","Harvey"
"1133",4290720,4295239,"The Black Bottom.The Varsity Drag.","Harvey"
"1134",4295319,4300680,"I don't know.I just don't seem to have
any time anymore.","Harvey"
"1135",4300760,4303840,"I have so many thingsto do.","Harvey"
"1136",4303920,4307359,"What is it you do,Mr. Dowd?","Harvey"
"1137",4307439,4310560,"Harvey and Isit in the bars...","Harvey"
"1138",4310640,4315840,"and have a drink or two,play the jukebox.","Harvey"
"1139",4315920,4319560,"And soon the facesof all the other people,","Harvey"
"1140",4319640,4324479,"they turn toward mineand they smile.","Harvey"
"1141",4324560,4329199,"They're saying, We don't knowyour name, mister,
but you're a very nice fellow.","Harvey"
"1142",4331000,4332960,"Harvey and I...","Harvey"
"1143",4334760,4338479,"warm ourselvesin all these golden moments.","Harvey"
"1144",4338560,4343520,"We've entered as strangers.Soon we have friends.","Harvey"
"1145",4343600,4346479,"And they come overand they sit with us,","Harvey"
"1146",4346560,4349079,"they drink with usthey talk to us.","Harvey"
"1147",4349159,4353520,"And they tell aboutthe big, terrible things
they've done...","Harvey"
"1148",4353560,4356600,"and the big, wonderful thingsthey'll do.","Harvey"
"1149",4356680,4361119,"Their hopesand their regrets,","Harvey"
"1150",4361199,4365840,"and their lovesand their hates,
all very large...","Harvey"
"1151",4365920,4369640,"because nobody ever bringsanything small into a bar.","Harvey"
"1152",4371880,4373920,"And then...","Harvey"
"1153",4375520,4377479,"I introduce themto Harvey.","Harvey"
"1154",4377520,4382039,"And he's bigger and granderthan anything they offer me.","Harvey"
"1155",4383680,4388560,"And...and when they leave,","Harvey"
"1156",4388600,4390800,"they leave impressed.","Harvey"
"1157",4392119,4395560,"The same peopleseldom come back,","Harvey"
"1158",4395600,4398960,"but that's...that's envy, my dear.","Harvey"
"1159",4400560,4404960,"There's a little bit of envyin the best of us.","Harvey"
"1160",4405039,4408039,"And that's too bad,isn't it?","Harvey"
"1161",4410560,4413760,"How did you happento call him Harvey?","Harvey"
"1162",4413840,4415880,"Well, Harvey'shis name.","Harvey"
"1163",4415960,4418000,"How do youknow that?","Harvey"
"1164",4419640,4423680,"There was a ratherinteresting coincidence
on that, Doctor.","Harvey"
"1165",4423760,4429439,"One night several years ago Iwas walking early in the evening
along Fairfax Street.","Harvey"
"1166",4429520,4433800,"It was between 18th and 19th.Do you know the block?","Harvey"
"1167",4433840,4436520,"Yes, yes.","Harvey"
"1168",4436560,4438520,"I'd just put Ed Hickeyinto a taxi.","Harvey"
"1169",4438600,4443239,"Ed had been mixinghis rye with his gin,
and he...","Harvey"
"1170",4443319,4445840,"I just felt thathe needed conveying.","Harvey"
"1171",4445920,4450880,"Anyway, I was walkingalong the street and
I heard this voice saying,","Harvey"
"1172",4450960,4453079,"Good evening, Mr. Dowd.","Harvey"
"1173",4453159,4456079,"Well, I turned around...","Harvey"
"1174",4456159,4460680,"and here was this bigsix-foot rabbit leaning
up against a lamppost.","Harvey"
"1175",4460760,4463880,"I thought nothing of thatbecause when you've lived
in a town...","Harvey"
"1176",4463960,4468840,"as long as I've lived in thisone, you get used to the fact
that everybody knows your name.","Harvey"
"1177",4468880,4472239,"Naturally, I went overto chat with him.","Harvey"
"1178",4472399,4475640,"And he said to me,he said,","Harvey"
"1179",4475720,4480000,"Ed Hickey was a little spiffedthis evening.
Or could I be mistaken?","Harvey"
"1180",4480079,4482199,"Of coursehe was not mistaken.","Harvey"
"1181",4482279,4487399,"I think the world and allof Ed, but he was spiffed.","Harvey"
"1182",4487479,4492560,"We talked like thatfor a while and then
I said to him,","Harvey"
"1183",4492640,4495039,"You have the advantageon me.","Harvey"
"1184",4495119,4498640,"You know my nameand I don't know yours.","Harvey"
"1185",4498720,4501960,"And right back at mehe said,","Harvey"
"1186",4502000,4504039,"What name do you like?","Harvey"
"1187",4504119,4508520,"Well, I didn't even haveto think twice about that.","Harvey"
"1188",4508600,4511159,"Harvey's always beenmy favorite name.","Harvey"
"1189",4511239,4515680,"So I said to him,I said, Harvey.","Harvey"
"1190",4515760,4519239,"And, uh...","Harvey"
"1191",4519319,4524479,"Th-This is the interesting thingabout the whole thing.","Harvey"
"1192",4524560,4528960,"He said,What a coincidence.","Harvey"
"1193",4529039,4531960,"My name happensto be Harvey.","Harvey"
"1194",4536760,4539239,"Dowd,","Harvey"
"1195",4539319,4542880,"what wasyour father's name?","Harvey"
"1196",4546239,4551319,"John.John Stuyvesant.","Harvey"
"1197",4551399,4553479,"Tell me, Dowd,","Harvey"
"1198",4555079,4559199,"when you were a child,didn't you have a playmate?","Harvey"
"1199",4559279,4561720,"Someone with whomyou spent many happy hours?","Harvey"
"1200",4561800,4564960,"Yes. Yes,I did, Doctor.","Harvey"
"1201",4565039,4566720,"Didn't you?Yes.","Harvey"
"1202",4566800,4569439,"What was his name?","Harvey"
"1203",4571680,4574520,"Vern.Vern McElhinney.","Harvey"
"1204",4574600,4576840,"You ever knowthe McElhinneys, Doctor?
No.","Harvey"
"1205",4576920,4580279,"That's too bad.There were a lot of them
and they circulated.","Harvey"
"1206",4580359,4584479,"Very nice people.Just wonderful people.","Harvey"
"1207",4584560,4587039,"Think carefully,Dowd.","Harvey"
"1208",4587119,4591199,"Didn't you know somebodysometime, someplace
by the name of Harvey?","Harvey"
"1209",4591279,4594199,"Didn't you ever know anybodyby that name?","Harvey"
"1210",4596359,4600000,"No. No,not one, Doctor.","Harvey"
"1211",4600079,4603359,"Maybe that's whyI always had
such hopes for it.","Harvey"
"1212",4603439,4605399,"[Door Opens]","Harvey"
"1213",4605439,4609520,"We looked in both ofthose joints, and Dr. Chumley
ain't in either one of'em.","Harvey"
"1214",4609600,4613199,"I brought help.What're you doin' out here?","Harvey"
"1215",4613279,4616039,"Come on. We're going backto the sanitarium.
Wh...","Harvey"
"1216",4616119,4619720,"Come, Elwood.Very well,
Lyman.","Harvey"
"1217",4619800,4622680,"I'm afraid I won't be ableto stay very long.
I must find Harvey.","Harvey"
"1218",4622760,4626239,"Which one is Dowd?My name's Dowd,
Elwood P.","Harvey"

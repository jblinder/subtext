"557",2108190,2110524,"Uncle Phillip, it's yourduty as an American citizen.","Saboteur"
"558",2110609,2113152,"It is my duty asan American citizen","Saboteur"

"562",2125081,2127917,"They sometimes involvedisregarding the law.","Saboteur"
"563",2128001,2130085,"But what are you going to do? Whatare you going to do with him?","Saboteur"

"567",2140472,2142598,"Oh, Uncle Phillip, how couldI do a thing like that?","Saboteur"
"568",2142682,2146101,"Because, you know, I can see agreat deal farther than you can.","Saboteur"
"569",2146186,2151065,"I can see intangible things.For example, innocence.","Saboteur"
"570",2151149,2152983,"Will you go withmy niece, Mr. Mason?","Saboteur"
"571",2153068,2156403,"Oh, yes, sir!If you don't mind?","Saboteur"

"591",2224264,2228017,"Only I'm not quite sure how muchexperience he's had with handcuffs.","Saboteur"
"592",2228101,2229894,"Do you mind if I see them?","Saboteur"
"593",2229978,2231604,"I wonder what he'll haveto do to get them off.","Saboteur"
"594",2231688,2235316,"I can't quite see. Could youhold them a little nearer?","Saboteur"
"595",2237068,2238652,"Now I feel better.","Saboteur"
"596",2238737,2240154,"I'll bet you do.","Saboteur"

"602",2249915,2251206,"You're gonna find that out.","Saboteur"
"603",2251291,2254251,"Even my uncle wouldn't have been sokind if he'd known more about you.","Saboteur"
"604",2254336,2257755,"All right, go ahead. What did I do?I'd be kind of happy to know.","Saboteur"
"605",2257839,2259423,"If it had been anyother sort of crime,","Saboteur"
"606",2259507,2261258,"if a man had stolenbecause he was starving,","Saboteur"
"607",2261343,2263260,"even if a man committedmurder to defend himself,","Saboteur"
"608",2263345,2264929,"maybe I wouldn'ttell the police.","Saboteur"
"609",2265013,2267431,"But there's only one reasonwhy a man commits sabotage.","Saboteur"

"1103",4020266,4021558,"We can't leave any loose ends.","Saboteur"
"1104",4021643,4022893,"All right! All right!","Saboteur"
"1105",4022977,4025896,"But for heaven's sake,stop playing the conspirator.","Saboteur"
"1106",4025980,4029608,"Now tell me all you knowabout the girl or ask him.","Saboteur"
"1107",4029693,4033696,"Why didn't you tell me about theyoung lady back in Soda City?","Saboteur"
"1108",4033780,4036573,"Oh. Well, I didn'tthink it was important.","Saboteur"
"1109",4036658,4038909,"She was just a girl,like anybody else.","Saboteur"
"1110",4038993,4041203,"She picked me up,she was pretty.","Saboteur"
"1111",4041287,4043080,"I guess it was kind of risky.","Saboteur"
"1112",4043164,4045541,"Well, there you are.","Saboteur"
"1113",4045625,4048669,"I'm so sorry to haveexposed you to any risk.","Saboteur"
"1114",4049129,4050754,"What's she doing here?","Saboteur"
"1115",4051506,4053465,"You're surprisedto see me again.","Saboteur"
"1116",4054175,4055384,"How did you get here?","Saboteur"
"1117",4055468,4056719,"It doesn'tmatter how she got here.","Saboteur"
"1118",4056803,4059221,"The point is there was no reasonto bring her here at all!","Saboteur"
"1119",4059305,4060264,"You see, Mr. Kane,","Saboteur"
"1120",4060348,4062141,"I just learned on thetelephone at the gas station","Saboteur"
"1121",4062225,4065144,"that she was most indiscreetafter she left you at Soda City.","Saboteur"
"1122",4065353,4067604,"She went straight to the localsheriff, who, fortunately,","Saboteur"
"1123",4067689,4069606,"happened to be a particularlygood friend of ours.","Saboteur"
"1124",4069691,4071608,"Oh, don't waste time inexplanations, Mr. Freeman.","Saboteur"
"1125",4071693,4074153,"You've got to get the girl outof this house, all of you.","Saboteur"
"1126",4075447,4077156,"I will not havemy benevolence abused!","Saboteur"
"1127",4077240,4079992,"So you played smart.That's great.","Saboteur"
"1128",4080076,4081493,"That's a big help to all of us.","Saboteur"
"1129",4082454,4086623,"No, I wasn't smart at all. Ihaven't been smart for four days.","Saboteur"
"1130",4086708,4089376,"Even when I went tothe sheriff I hesitated.","Saboteur"
"1131",4089461,4091587,"I hated to do anything thatmight get you into trouble.","Saboteur"
"1132",4091671,4092838,"Yeah, I sympathize.","Saboteur"
"1133",4092922,4095048,"The mistake I made was not leavingyou back there with the snakes!","Saboteur"
"1134",4095133,4096508,"You might have at leastlearned to rattle.","Saboteur"
"1135",4096593,4098177,"I was right about youin the first place.","Saboteur"
"1136",4098553,4100512,"Good evening, Mr. Kane.","Saboteur"
"1137",4102932,4104892,"I didn't knowyou were a bookworm.","Saboteur"
"1138",4104976,4106852,"You must let me choosesomething appropriate for you.","Saboteur"
"1139",4106936,4110022,"Something not too difficultfor you to understand.","Saboteur"
"1140",4110106,4111607,"Let me see.","Saboteur"
"1141",4116070,4118447,"Here we are.This will do admirably.","Saboteur"
"1142",4118531,4121742,"Remarkable work.Somehow prophetic.","Saboteur"
"1143",4123119,4126955,"Why are you here, Charles? And what'sall this nonsense about books?","Saboteur"
"1144",4127040,4128707,"I am a refugee.","Saboteur"
"1145",4128792,4132920,"I have at last joined that revoltinggroup of world travelers.","Saboteur"
"1146",4133004,4136632,"One ultimately turns into thething one despises most.","Saboteur"
"1147",4137217,4140469,"And whom have I to thank for it?You, Mr. Freeman.","Saboteur"
"1148",4140553,4142638,"The girl was allowedto escape unobserved.","Saboteur"
"1149",4142722,4144973,"She left Mr. Kane,went straight to her uncle.","Saboteur"
"1150",4145266,4148352,"And that charming old manwent to the police.","Saboteur"
"1151",4148436,4151772,"As a result, a whole hoard ofofficers came to my house.","Saboteur"
"1152",4151856,4154483,"Luckily, I was leavingwhen they arrived.","Saboteur"
"1153",4154567,4157486,"And the others,the very loyal ones,","Saboteur"
"1154",4157570,4159363,"well, they're payingfor their loyalty.","Saboteur"
"1155",4159447,4163867,"How appalling! Your charming house.I'm so sorry, Charles.","Saboteur"
"1156",4163952,4167037,"It's rather lucky.You might have been sorrier.","Saboteur"
"1157",4167121,4169206,"And you might have beena little more efficient","Saboteur"
"1158",4169290,4170415,"in this whole matter,Mr. Freeman!","Saboteur"
"1159",4170500,4172501,"What good is it goingto do you to insult me?","Saboteur"
"1160",4172585,4173794,"We're in trouble now.","Saboteur"
"1161",4173878,4175337,"And so the most important thing","Saboteur"
"1162",4175421,4177631,"is to make sure ofeveryone around us.","Saboteur"
"1163",4177715,4178924,"Of Mr. Kane?","Saboteur"
"1164",4179008,4181343,"I'm just not sure. Iwant to know that he's all right.","Saboteur"
"1165",4181427,4184054,"All right?What an understatement.","Saboteur"
"1166",4184430,4186473,"He's much more than that!","Saboteur"
"1167",4187225,4189560,"He's noble and fine and pure.","Saboteur"
"1168",4189894,4191061,"And so he pays the penalty","Saboteur"
"1169",4191145,4194189,"that the noble and the fine andthe pure must pay in this world.","Saboteur"
"1170",4194274,4196358,"He's misjudged by everyone.","Saboteur"
"1171",4196442,4200487,"Why, even the police have a completelyerroneous impression of him.","Saboteur"
"1172",4200572,4204032,"I can assure you thatcontrary to what is supposed","Saboteur"
"1173",4204117,4206785,"and to what he mayhimself have told you,","Saboteur"
"1174",4206870,4209830,"that young man is certainly notone of his country's enemies.","Saboteur"
"1175",4209914,4211707,"Charles, you're joking!","Saboteur"
"1176",4211833,4213667,"I mean exactly what I say.","Saboteur"
"1177",4213751,4217170,"Mr. Kane is definitely no partof our little organization.","Saboteur"
"1178",4217255,4220090,"Your prot�g�. Well,you've done splendidly.","Saboteur"
"1179",4220174,4221800,"You bring him here, you idiot.","Saboteur"
"1180",4221885,4224011,"Now what in heaven's nameare we going to do with him?","Saboteur"
"1181",4224095,4226680,"That's a veryappropriate question.","Saboteur"
"1182",4226764,4228348,"Not much we can do with him.","Saboteur"
"1183",4228433,4231810,"I made the mistake once ofturning him over to the police.","Saboteur"
"1184",4231895,4234813,"That's even moreimpossible at the moment.","Saboteur"
"1185",4235607,4239067,"I'm afraid there'sonly one thing we can do.","Saboteur"
"1186",4240278,4246825,"You see, the new law threatens allof us with the death penalty.","Saboteur"
"1187",4247535,4250579,"So, I'm afraid we'll haveto apply the ancient axiom.","Saboteur"
"1188",4250663,4253665,"Tooth for a tooth.Kane for a Tobin.","Saboteur"
"1189",4253750,4255667,"Please don't discuss thingsof that sort here.","Saboteur"
"1190",4255752,4258879,"It's rather nauseatingand quite out of place.","Saboteur"
"1191",4259839,4264509,"Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.We must take all precaution.","Saboteur"
"1192",4264594,4266470,"Of course. We must alsocontinue with our work.","Saboteur"
"1193",4266554,4269139,"It's too risky now. We'realready abandoning the dam.","Saboteur"
"1194",4269223,4270682,"We must remaininactive for a while.","Saboteur"
"1195",4270767,4272768,"Inactive? You areutterly mistaken.","Saboteur"
"1196",4272852,4275103,"Once we do that, ourorganization is finished.","Saboteur"
"1197",4275188,4276271,"We must carry on at all costs.","Saboteur"
"1198",4276356,4277439,"What about tomorrow's work?","Saboteur"
"1199",4277523,4279942,"Tomorrow's work? You can't abandonthat after all your preparations.","Saboteur"
"1200",4280026,4281360,"But, Charles, the risk...","Saboteur"
"1201",4281444,4283070,"Is great. I know that.","Saboteur"
"1202",4283696,4287115,"Unfortunately, we will haveto carry out our orders.","Saboteur"
"1203",4288493,4291119,"I am leaving forthe Caribbean now.","Saboteur"
"1204",4291204,4295082,"My position here is moreimpossible than all of yours.","Saboteur"
"1205",4295166,4298210,"Of course I'm rather lookingforward to Central America.","Saboteur"
"1206",4298294,4301004,"Havana will bevery gay this season.","Saboteur"
"1207",4301089,4305133,"You know, somehow I've suddenlyhad enough of this country.","Saboteur"
"1208",4305218,4306969,"The war has made it grim.","Saboteur"
"1209",4307637,4309179,"You're leaving us hereto face everything,","Saboteur"
"1210",4309263,4311306,"and you'll be ona boat sailing along.","Saboteur"
"1211",4311391,4312641,"It all sounds idyllic.","Saboteur"
"1212",4312725,4316937,"Oh, Charles, Charles, thiswhole thing, it's impossible.","Saboteur"
"1213",4317021,4318814,"It's panicky.","Saboteur"
"1214",4320024,4321608,"I'm deeply sorry.","Saboteur"
"1215",4321693,4323110,"There you are, darling!","Saboteur"
"1216",4323194,4325946,"How unbecoming for a hostessto hide herself away.","Saboteur"
"1217",4326030,4327781,"Am I intruding? I am so sorry,","Saboteur"
"1218",4327865,4329533,"but I just mustkidnap Henrietta.","Saboteur"
"1219",4329617,4331535,"- She'll be back.- I've had some trouble with these people.","Saboteur"
"1220",4331619,4333787,"They're doing the catering andmaking rather a horrid mess of it.","Saboteur"
"1221",4333871,4335998,"Our boy will appear any minutewith the caviar! I assure you.","Saboteur"
"1222",4336082,4337457,"I'll stake my reputation on it.","Saboteur"
"1223",4337542,4339418,"Don't be a fool!Get to the house phone.","Saboteur"
"1224",4339502,4340877,"- How'd you get here?- They met me at the airport.","Saboteur"
"1225",4340962,4342754,"I thought they were the police,then they brought me here.","Saboteur"
"1226",4342839,4346258,"Wait a minute. No usetrying the way I came in.","Saboteur"
"1227",4346342,4349845,"Let's walk right out throughthe front door! Might as well.","Saboteur"
"1228",4349929,4352889,"Yes, sir. We'll watch the back exit.They won't get out.","Saboteur"
"1229",4362442,4363442,"No good.","Saboteur"
"1230",4363526,4365152,"See the one on the other side?I met him on the way in.","Saboteur"
"1231",4365236,4367237,"He's one of them. We'llnever get out that way.","Saboteur"
"1232",4367321,4369156,"- What can they do to us?- Plenty.","Saboteur"
"1233",4369240,4370699,"They'd grab us.We wouldn't have a chance.","Saboteur"
"1234",4370783,4372159,"But these peoplewould see them do it.","Saboteur"
"1235",4372243,4373618,"Of course. And ifanyone had a question,","Saboteur"
"1236",4373703,4375162,"we're a couple of gatecrashers.","Saboteur"
"1237",4375246,4378206,"Barry, this is awful.It's like a bad dream.","Saboteur"
"1238",4378583,4380584,"All these people here. Isn'tthere anyone we can trust?","Saboteur"
"1239",4380668,4383378,"Sure there is. All of them.Only which one?","Saboteur"
"1240",4391095,4394014,"Excuse me. This maysound sort of crazy.","Saboteur"
"1241",4394098,4396767,"In fact, I don't evenknow how to start.","Saboteur"
"1242",4396851,4400687,"But this whole house is ahotbed of spies and saboteurs.","Saboteur"
"1243",4400772,4403440,"I'm not being silly. I assure you.Even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.","Saboteur"
"1244",4403524,4406276,"What's the matter with you, sir?You're drunk!","Saboteur"
"1245",4407111,4408779,"You're not even dressed.","Saboteur"
"1246",4411574,4412741,"What'd he say?","Saboteur"
"1247",4412825,4414534,"Oh, he thinks I'm drunk.","Saboteur"
"1248",4415244,4418455,"When I read in thepapers what those Japs are doing...","Saboteur"
"1249",4418539,4419581,"Beat it out! Beat it out.","Saboteur"
"1250",4419665,4422209,"Keep it natural.Eight to the bar.","Saboteur"
"1251",4422293,4424878,"Yeah, man. Stay in that pitch.","Saboteur"
"1252",4424962,4428715,"Pardon me. Did you pay $25to get in here tonight?","Saboteur"
"1253",4428800,4430884,"No, not exactly. My bossgave me a ticket. Why?","Saboteur"
"1254",4430968,4432260,"I need your help very badly.","Saboteur"
"1255",4432345,4433595,"We're in the middle ofthe biggest bunch of","Saboteur"
"1256",4433679,4434763,"fifth columnistsin the country.","Saboteur"
"1257",4434847,4436223,"Are you kidding?What's the gag?","Saboteur"
"1258",4436307,4437307,"No, I'm on the level.This is it.","Saboteur"
"1259",4437391,4439434,"Aw, you're kidding. Wegot a wag on the joint.","Saboteur"
"1260",4439519,4440602,"The guy's trying to rib me.","Saboteur"
"1261",4440686,4442562,"Aw, sling him your curve.","Saboteur"
"1262",4442647,4444481,"Beat it out, son. Beat it out.","Saboteur"
"1263",4453699,4456660,"Excuse me, sir. I'dlike to talk to you","Saboteur"
"1264",4456744,4457953,"about something very important.","Saboteur"
"1265",4458496,4460413,"What is it, Mr. Kane?","Saboteur"
"1266",4460498,4462332,"You know it's hopeless.","Saboteur"
"1267",4462416,4466086,"Why don't you join Mr. Tobinupstairs for a little supper?","Saboteur"
"1268",4466170,4467921,"I'll show you the way.","Saboteur"

"1278",4519432,4521433,"Yeah. And when you try towarn them, they laugh at you.","Saboteur"
"1279",4521517,4522976,"They think you're drunk.","Saboteur"
"1280",4523060,4524519,"That gray-haired manyou spoke to,","Saboteur"
"1281",4524604,4526229,"he seemed like suchan honest citizen.","Saboteur"
"1282",4526314,4527439,"Hmm.","Saboteur"
"1283",4527523,4531276,"Just a friend of the family. I guessthe room's well sprinkled with them.","Saboteur"
"1284",4531360,4533361,"They're so smart.That's what frightens me.","Saboteur"
"1285",4533446,4536031,"Yeah, they're smart, that'sbecause they're ruthless.","Saboteur"
"1286",4536115,4539367,"It's easy to win when youforget about the rules.","Saboteur"
"1287",4539744,4541912,"A man named Fry drops awallet in California","Saboteur"
"1288",4541996,4543997,"and we wind up here,you and me.","Saboteur"
"1289",4544081,4546041,"That's the only good partof it, I'm with you.","Saboteur"
"1290",4546125,4548168,"I wish it were somewhere else.","Saboteur"
"1291",4548252,4549711,"The North Pole,I wouldn't care.","Saboteur"

"1294",4554467,4558803,"Fry. He seems so small now.I'd forgotten about him.","Saboteur"
"1295",4558930,4560305,"So had I.","Saboteur"
"1296",4561140,4562641,"Well, we can't justgo on dancing","Saboteur"
"1297",4562725,4564684,"like it's Saturday nightat The Palladium.","Saboteur"

"1299",4567480,4569481,"What do you thinkthey'll really do?","Saboteur"
"1300",4569607,4570982,"Oh, right nowthey're probably haggling","Saboteur"
"1301",4571067,4572567,"over the price withMurder Incorporated.","Saboteur"
"1302",4572652,4574069,"Oh, Barry, please!","Saboteur"

"1308",4584622,4586373,"One of us has gotto get out of here.","Saboteur"
"1309",4586457,4588583,"Maybe if I start something,you can make a break for it.","Saboteur"

"1448",5084329,5086456,"This whole job hangson one thing, timing.","Saboteur"
"1449",5087166,5088416,"If the section ofthe slipway goes up","Saboteur"
"1450",5088500,5089876,"before the actualmoment of launching,","Saboteur"
"1451",5089960,5091294,"then all our effortshave been wasted.","Saboteur"
"1452",5092004,5094589,"If you blow her too late, well,then you just scare the crowd.","Saboteur"
"1453",5095048,5097258,"Timing, timing, timing.","Saboteur"

"514",2399814,2402442,"No wonder you could tell usall you knew about him.","Wayne's World"
"515",2402616,2405517,"It didn't hurt McKay,and it got you in here solid.","Wayne's World"
"516",2405686,2408280,"McKay had absolutely nothing to dowith my coming here.","Wayne's World"

"538",2480461,2482156,"...and for no other reason.","Wayne's World"

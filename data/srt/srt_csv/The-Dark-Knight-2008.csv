"948",4262648,4265731,"Secondly, because the Batmanhas offered to turn himself in.","The Dark Knight"
"949",4265901,4267607,"But let's consider the situation.","The Dark Knight"
"950",4267987,4270607,"Should we give into this terrorist's demands?","The Dark Knight"
"951",4270781,4272238,"Do we really think he's gonna...?","The Dark Knight"

"954",4279206,4281114,"That's not why we demandhe turn himself in...","The Dark Knight"
"955",4281292,4282950,"...we're doing it because we're scared.","The Dark Knight"
"956",4283127,4285913,"We've been happy to let Batmanclean up our streets till now.","The Dark Knight"
"957",4286088,4289040,"Things are worse than ever!Amen.","The Dark Knight"
"958",4290384,4292292,"Yes, they are.","The Dark Knight"

"962",4304731,4309272,"One day, the Batman will have to answerfor the laws he's broken. But to us...","The Dark Knight"
"963",4309444,4311186,"...not to this madman.","The Dark Knight"
"964",4311363,4313687,"-No more dead cops!Yeah!","The Dark Knight"
"965",4316993,4318569,"He should turn himself in!","The Dark Knight"

"973",4347607,4350606,"-He went down to the press conference.-I know. He just stood by.","The Dark Knight"
"974",4350777,4352851,"Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...","The Dark Knight"
"975",4353029,4356028,"...believe that Batman stands forsomething more important...","The Dark Knight"
"976",4356199,4358523,"...than the whims of a terrorist,Miss Dawes...","The Dark Knight"
"977",4358701,4360692,"...even if everyone hates him for it.","The Dark Knight"
"978",4360870,4362991,"That's the sacrifice he's making.","The Dark Knight"
"979",4363164,4366781,"He's not being a hero.He's being something more.","The Dark Knight"
"980",4367335,4368958,"Yeah, you're absolutely right.","The Dark Knight"

"1877",8627618,8629195,"He didn't do anything wrong.","The Dark Knight"

"1879",8638963,8639994,"So we'll hunt him...","The Dark Knight"
"1880",8643133,8645209,"... because he can take it.","The Dark Knight"
"1881",8647721,8650211,"Because he's not our hero.","The Dark Knight"
"1882",8657773,8658971,"He's a silent guardian...","The Dark Knight"
"1883",8660150,8662023,"...a watchful protector.","The Dark Knight"

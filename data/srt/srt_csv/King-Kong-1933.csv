"228",941992,944232,"I know the East Indies likeI do my own hand","King Kong"
"229",944383,947063,"but I've never been here.- Where do we go from here?","King Kong"
"230",947255,948895,"- Southwest.- Southwest?","King Kong"
"231",949090,951450,"Well, there is nothingfor thousands of miles.","King Kong"
"232",951601,954681,"Keep your shirt on, skipper.We're not going thousands of miles.","King Kong"
"233",954833,957433,"Here's the island we're looking for.","King Kong"
"234",958939,961659,"Well, that position.Let's have the big chart.","King Kong"
"235",961810,963770,"You won't findthat island on any chart.","King Kong"
"236",963924,966684,"That was made by the skipperof a Norwegian bark.","King Kong"
"237",966835,969235,"- He must have been kidding.- No, he wasn't.","King Kong"
"238",969387,973707,"Listen, a canoe full of natives fromthis island was blown to sea.","King Kong"
"239",973852,976172,"When the bark picked them,there was one alive.","King Kong"
"240",976364,979204,"He died before they reached port,not before the skipper","King Kong"
"241",979355,982795,"had a description of the islandand got an idea of where it lies.","King Kong"
"242",982947,985347,"- Where did you get it?- Singapore, two years ago.","King Kong"
"243",985498,987058,"Skipper knew I'd be interested.","King Kong"

"245",990682,994122,"Here. Here's whatthe island looks like.","King Kong"
"246",997859,999699,"There's a long, sandy peninsula.","King Kong"
"247",999853,1002613,"The only possible landing placeis through this reef.","King Kong"
"248",1002764,1005644,"Rest of shoreline's sheer precipice,hundreds of feet high.","King Kong"
"249",1005795,1008435,"And across the baseof the peninsula, cutting it off","King Kong"
"250",1008586,1011066,"from the restof the island, is a wall.","King Kong"
"251",1011617,1014857,"- A wall?- Built long ago. People who lived there","King Kong"
"252",1015006,1018086,"slipped back, forgottenthe high civilization that built it.","King Kong"
"253",1018278,1020798,"That wall is as strong todayas it was centuries ago.","King Kong"
"254",1020949,1023429,"The natives keep that wall in repair.","King Kong"
"255",1023581,1025581,"- They need it.- Why?","King Kong"
"256",1025734,1029254,"There's something on the other sideof it. Something they fear.","King Kong"
"257",1029443,1031643,"A hostile tribe.","King Kong"
"258",1038375,1041535,"Did you ever hear of Kong?","King Kong"
"259",1043639,1045559,"Why, yes.","King Kong"
"260",1045713,1049473,"Some native superstition, isn't it?A god or a spirit or something.","King Kong"
"261",1050019,1052579,"Well, anyway,neither beast nor man","King Kong"
"262",1052732,1055772,"something monstrous,all-powerful.","King Kong"
"263",1056160,1057480,"Still living","King Kong"
"264",1057635,1061195,"still holding that islandin a grip of deadly fear.","King Kong"
"265",1064456,1066696,"Well, every legendhas a basis of truth.","King Kong"
"266",1066847,1070727,"I tell you, there's something on thatisland that no white man has ever seen.","King Kong"
"267",1070876,1075036,"- And you expect to photograph it?- If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.","King Kong"
"268",1075899,1078539,"Suppose it doesn't likehaving its picture taken?","King Kong"
"269",1080604,1084884,"Well, now you know why I broughtalong those cases of gas bombs.","King Kong"
"270",1091690,1094930,"Oh, you've put on a beauty-and-beastcostume, eh?","King Kong"
"271",1095081,1097001,"It's the prettiest.","King Kong"
"272",1097154,1100154,"All right. Just stand right over there.","King Kong"
"273",1101462,1104902,"I'm sort of nervous.Suppose I don't photograph well?","King Kong"
"274",1105050,1108130,"You don't have to worry about that.If I hadn't been sure","King Kong"
"275",1108280,1110960,"I wouldn't have brought youaround the world.","King Kong"
"276",1111191,1114551,"- What will I do?- Well, we start with the profile.","King Kong"
"277",1114700,1116380,"When I start cranking","King Kong"
"278",1116534,1119454,"why, hold it a minute, andthen turn slowly toward me.","King Kong"
"279",1119605,1123165,"You see me.You smile a little, then you listen.","King Kong"
"280",1123354,1126074,"Then you laugh. All right.","King Kong"
"281",1126224,1127784,"Camera.","King Kong"
"282",1137948,1140668,"- Looks kind of silly, don't it?- Pretty dame, huh?","King Kong"
"283",1140860,1142940,"You think maybehe like to take my picture?","King Kong"
"284",1143093,1146413,"Them cameras cost money.Shouldn't think he'd risk it.","King Kong"
"285",1148316,1151316,"Now, that's fine, Ann.Now we'll try one with a filter, eh?","King Kong"
"286",1151906,1153906,"Do you always takethe pictures yourself?","King Kong"
"287",1154538,1156498,"Ever since a trip I made to Africa.","King Kong"
"288",1156652,1159252,"I'd have got a swell pictureof a charging rhino","King Kong"
"289",1159403,1160923,"but the cameraman got scared.","King Kong"
"290",1161117,1163717,"The darned fool.I was right there with a rifle.","King Kong"
"291",1163909,1166869,"Seems he didn't trust me to getthe rhino before it got him.","King Kong"
"292",1167020,1170460,"I haven't fooled with acameramen since. I do it myself.","King Kong"
"293",1170609,1173569,"- Think he's crazy, skipper?- Just enthusiastic.","King Kong"
"294",1173959,1175759,"Ann, in this oneyou're looking down.","King Kong"
"295",1175952,1178912,"When I start to crank,you look up slowly.","King Kong"
"296",1179063,1181983,"You're quite calm.You don't expect to see a thing.","King Kong"
"297",1182134,1185574,"Then you just followmy directions. All right?","King Kong"
"298",1186839,1190359,"Camera. Look up slowly, Ann.","King Kong"
"299",1190547,1193707,"That's it. You don't see anything.","King Kong"
"300",1193858,1196018,"Now look higher","King Kong"
"301",1196210,1198650,"still higher.","King Kong"
"302",1198841,1202401,"Now you see it. You're amazed.","King Kong"
"303",1202550,1206470,"You can't believe it.Your eyes open wider.","King Kong"
"304",1206658,1209178,"It's horrible, Ann,but you can't look away.","King Kong"
"305",1209329,1211609,"There's no chance for you, Ann,no escape.","King Kong"
"306",1211761,1213681,"You're helpless, Ann, helpless.","King Kong"
"307",1213876,1216556,"There's just one chance,if you can scream","King Kong"
"308",1216708,1220588,"but your throat's paralyzed.Try to scream, Ann, try.","King Kong"
"309",1220735,1223055,"Perhaps if you didn't see it,you could scream.","King Kong"
"310",1223207,1227607,"Throw your arm across your eyesand scream. Scream for your life.","King Kong"
"311",1231102,1233862,"What's he thinkshe's really gonna see?","King Kong"
"312",1249286,1252926,"This infernal fog.Sure of your position, skipper?","King Kong"
"313",1253075,1255875,"Last night before this fog shut down,I got a good sight.","King Kong"
"314",1256027,1257787,"We should be near the island.","King Kong"
"315",1258140,1260780,"If we don't see it when this fog lifts,we never will.","King Kong"
"316",1260930,1262370,"We've quartered these parts.","King Kong"
"317",1262846,1264526,"Can't see your hand in front of your face.","King Kong"
"318",1264679,1267639,"Hey, Charlie, I wish you'd makeyour soup as thick as this.","King Kong"
"319",1271339,1274339,"No bottom at 30.","King Kong"
"320",1274488,1277608,"The Norwegian skipper must'vebeen guessing at the position.","King Kong"
"321",1277759,1279399,"How will we knowit's the right island?","King Kong"

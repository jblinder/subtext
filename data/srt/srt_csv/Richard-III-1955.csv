"1299",5795122,5797750,"somewhat against our meaning,have prevented.","Richard III"
"1300",5797825,5800885,"Because, my lord, we would havehad you hear the traitor speak...","Richard III"
"1301",5800961,5803828,"and timorously confess the mannerand the purpose of his treason...","Richard III"
"1302",5803898,5807527,"that you might wellhave signified the same unto the citizens...","Richard III"
"1303",5807601,5812197,"who haply may misconstrue usin him and wail his death.","Richard III"
"1304",5812273,5815174,"But, my good lord,Your Grace's word shall serve...","Richard III"

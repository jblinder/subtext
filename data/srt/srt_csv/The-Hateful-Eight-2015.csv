"786",2817579,2821788,"For the sake of my analogy,let's just assume that you did it.","The Hateful Eight"
"787",2821900,2824027,"Now, John Ruth wantsto take you back to Red Rock","The Hateful Eight"
"788",2824139,2826063,"to stand trial for murder.","The Hateful Eight"

"794",2841139,2842983,"end up taking place,","The Hateful Eight"
"795",2843099,2846103,"that's what civilized society","The Hateful Eight"
"796",2846219,2849541,"calls justice.","The Hateful Eight"
"797",2849659,2851548,"However,","The Hateful Eight"

"802",2863500,2865547,"and hung you up by the neck,","The Hateful Eight"
"803",2865659,2869027,"that would be frontier justice.","The Hateful Eight"
"804",2869139,2872063,"Now, the good part","The Hateful Eight"
"805",2872179,2873909,"about frontier justice","The Hateful Eight"
"806",2874019,2877661,"is it's very thirst-quenching.","The Hateful Eight"
"807",2877780,2882228,"The bad part isit's apt to be wrong as right.","The Hateful Eight"
"808",2882340,2883670,"Well, not in your case.","The Hateful Eight"
"809",2883780,2885110,"In your case, you'd have it coming.","The Hateful Eight"

"812",2892619,2896260,"The real difference is me.","The Hateful Eight"
"813",2896380,2897869,"The hangman.","The Hateful Eight"

"821",2915019,2917909,"will be a dispassionate man.","The Hateful Eight"
"822",2918019,2922309,"And that dispassionis the very essence of justice.","The Hateful Eight"
"823",2922420,2926219,"For justice delivered without dispassion","The Hateful Eight"
"824",2926340,2930981,"is always in danger of not being justice.","The Hateful Eight"

"1740",6650739,6652229,"Yeah, he did, didn't he?","The Hateful Eight"
"1741",6652340,6655389,"Yeah, he did, didn't he?","The Hateful Eight"
"1742",6655500,6658708,"But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.","The Hateful Eight"
"1743",6660140,6663064,"Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?","The Hateful Eight"
"1744",6663180,6664750,"A week?","The Hateful Eight"
"1745",6665899,6667345,"Si.","The Hateful Eight"
"1746",6668420,6670069,"See...","The Hateful Eight"
"1747",6670180,6673149,"my mama used to make stew,","The Hateful Eight"
"1748",6673260,6676824,"and it always tasted the same,no matter the meat.","The Hateful Eight"
"1749",6676939,6678863,"And there was another fellowon the plantation,","The Hateful Eight"
"1750",6678979,6680505,"Uncle Charly.","The Hateful Eight"
"1751",6680619,6682145,"He made stew, too.","The Hateful Eight"
"1752",6682260,6683944,"And like my mama,","The Hateful Eight"
"1753",6684060,6687951,"I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper","The Hateful Eight"
"1754",6688060,6690461,"till I was a full-grown man.","The Hateful Eight"
"1755",6691659,6693582,"No matter the meat,","The Hateful Eight"
"1756",6693699,6696543,"it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.","The Hateful Eight"
"1757",6697819,6701462,"Now, I ain't had Minnie's stewin six months, so I ain't no expert.","The Hateful Eight"
"1758",6701579,6705664,"But that damn sure is...","The Hateful Eight"
"1759",6705779,6708465,"Minnie's stew.","The Hateful Eight"
"1760",6708579,6710947,"So if Minnie is on the north side","The Hateful Eight"
"1761",6711060,6713539,"visitin' her mama for a week,","The Hateful Eight"
"1762",6713699,6716510,"how'd she make the stew this mornin'?","The Hateful Eight"
"1763",6716659,6718185,"Hmm.","The Hateful Eight"
"1764",6720819,6723710,"And this...","The Hateful Eight"
"1765",6723819,6727619,"this is Sweet Dave's chair.","The Hateful Eight"
"1766",6727739,6729787,"When I sat in it earlier,","The Hateful Eight"
"1767",6729899,6731708,"I couldn't believe it.","The Hateful Eight"
"1768",6731819,6734345,"Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.","The Hateful Eight"
"1769",6734460,6736701,"Uh, this may be Minnie's place,","The Hateful Eight"
"1770",6736819,6740108,"but this is damn sure","The Hateful Eight"
"1771",6740220,6742301,"Sweet Dave's chair.","The Hateful Eight"
"1772",6744619,6747783,"And if he went to the north side...","The Hateful Eight"
"1773",6749539,6751780,"I'm pretty goddamn sure","The Hateful Eight"
"1774",6751899,6754585,"this chair be goin' with him.","The Hateful Eight"
"1775",6759220,6761063,"What's in the chair?","The Hateful Eight"
"1776",6761180,6763341,"Just what I thought.","The Hateful Eight"
"1777",6763500,6766470,"Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.","The Hateful Eight"
"1778",6766579,6768229,"Hoo!","The Hateful Eight"
"1779",6768380,6770064,"Hoo-hoo-hoo!","The Hateful Eight"
"1780",6772180,6776503,"So, are you actually accusing me of murder?","The Hateful Eight"
"1781",6779699,6782670,"Way I see it, Senor Bob,","The Hateful Eight"
"1782",6782779,6785943,"is whoever is workin' with her","The Hateful Eight"
"1783",6786060,6788904,"ain't who they say they is.","The Hateful Eight"
"1784",6789020,6790863,"And if it's you,","The Hateful Eight"
"1785",6790979,6793108,"that means Minnie and her man","The Hateful Eight"
"1786",6793220,6795063,"ain't at her mama's.","The Hateful Eight"
"1787",6795180,6798662,"They layin' out back there dead somewhere.","The Hateful Eight"
"1788",6798779,6800828,"Or if it's you, little British man,","The Hateful Eight"
"1789",6800939,6804149,"the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'in a ditch somewhere","The Hateful Eight"
"1790",6804260,6806786,"and you just a English fellapassin' off his papers.","The Hateful Eight"
"1791",6806899,6809664,"Or we go by my theory,","The Hateful Eight"
"1792",6809779,6812703,"which is the ugliest guy did it.","The Hateful Eight"
"1793",6812819,6815390,"Which makes it you, Joe Gage.","The Hateful Eight"
"1794",6815500,6819788,"So I take it you deducedthe coffee was poisoned","The Hateful Eight"
"1795",6819899,6821868,"while you were murdering the old man?","The Hateful Eight"
"1796",6823060,6824710,"Yes.","The Hateful Eight"
"1797",6824819,6827345,"Well, mi negro amigo,","The Hateful Eight"
"1798",6827460,6829622,"during that whole incident,","The Hateful Eight"
"1799",6829739,6832345,"I was sitting on that side of the room","The Hateful Eight"
"1800",6832460,6834667,"playing ""Silent Night"" on the piano.","The Hateful Eight"
"1801",6834819,6837823,"Oh, I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.","The Hateful Eight"
"1802",6837939,6840909,"I said you didn't make the stew.","The Hateful Eight"
"1803",6842420,6845902,"My theory is...","The Hateful Eight"
"1804",6846020,6849024,"you workin' with the man","The Hateful Eight"
"1805",6849140,6853341,"who poisoned the coffee,and both of y'all murdered Minnie,","The Hateful Eight"
"1806",6853460,6856384,"Sweet Dave and whoever elsepicked this bad-luck day","The Hateful Eight"
"1807",6856500,6859344,"to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this mornin'.","The Hateful Eight"
"1808",6859460,6863225,"And at some point, y'all intended","The Hateful Eight"
"1809",6863340,6865819,"to bushwhack John Ruth","The Hateful Eight"
"1810",6865939,6868704,"and free Daisy.","The Hateful Eight"
"1811",6868819,6871265,"But you didn't count on the blizzard,","The Hateful Eight"
"1812",6871380,6874429,"and you didn't count on the two of us.","The Hateful Eight"
"1813",6874539,6875701,"Hmm.","The Hateful Eight"
"1814",6879100,6881068,"That's far as I got. How am I doing?","The Hateful Eight"
"1815",6884979,6887426,"You're a real imaginative nigger,","The Hateful Eight"
"1816",6887579,6889787,"ain't you?","The Hateful Eight"
"1817",6889899,6892743,"So, do you intend to murder me","The Hateful Eight"
"1818",6892859,6895180,"based on a far-fetched nigger theory,","The Hateful Eight"
"1819",6895340,6897707,"or can you prove it, cabron?","The Hateful Eight"
"1820",6899260,6904390,"It ain't so far-fetched, Senor Bob.","The Hateful Eight"
"1821",6904500,6907265,"And it's a little bit more than a theory.","The Hateful Eight"
"1822",6911619,6914190,"How long you say you been workin' for Minnie?","The Hateful Eight"
"1823",6914300,6916064,"Four months.","The Hateful Eight"
"1824",6916180,6917908,"Mmm.","The Hateful Eight"
"1825",6918020,6920704,"See, if you'd have been heretwo and a half years ago,","The Hateful Eight"
"1826",6920819,6924666,"you'd know 'bout that signused to hang up over the bar.","The Hateful Eight"
"1827",6924779,6927225,"Minnie mention that to you?","The Hateful Eight"
"1828",6928539,6930382,"No.","The Hateful Eight"
"1829",6930539,6933305,"You want to know whatthat sign said, Senor Bob?","The Hateful Eight"
"1830",6935460,6939748,"""No dogs or Mexicans allowed.""","The Hateful Eight"
"1831",6943260,6946822,"Now, Minnie hung that sign upthe day she opened this haberdashery.","The Hateful Eight"
"1832",6946939,6949909,"And it hung over that bar every day","The Hateful Eight"
"1833",6950060,6953029,"till she took it downa little over two years ago.","The Hateful Eight"
"1834",6954619,6956384,"You know why she took it down?","The Hateful Eight"
"1835",6958260,6960786,"She started lettin' in dogs.","The Hateful Eight"
"1836",6964460,6968430,"Now, Minnie liked just about everybody,","The Hateful Eight"
"1837",6968579,6970707,"but she sure don't","The Hateful Eight"
"1838",6970819,6972662,"like Mexicans.","The Hateful Eight"
"1839",6972779,6974703,"So when you tell me","The Hateful Eight"
"1840",6974819,6978381,"Minnie went to the north sideto visit her mama,","The Hateful Eight"
"1841",6978500,6981070,"well, I find that highly unlikely.","The Hateful Eight"
"1842",6981180,6984467,"But okay, maybe.","The Hateful Eight"
"1843",6984579,6987185,"But when you tell me","The Hateful Eight"
"1844",6987300,6990940,"Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,","The Hateful Eight"
"1845",6991100,6995024,"the most precious thing to herin the whole world,","The Hateful Eight"
"1846",6995140,6999110,"and left it in the handsof a goddamn Mexican?","The Hateful Eight"
"1847",7000579,7002229,"Well, that's what I meant in the barn","The Hateful Eight"
"1848",7002340,7005070,"when I said that suredon't sound like Minnie.","The Hateful Eight"
"1849",7007140,7010144,"Now I am calling you a liar,","The Hateful Eight"
"1850",7010260,7012228,"Senor Bob.","The Hateful Eight"
"1851",7013500,7015502,"And if you lyin',","The Hateful Eight"
"1852",7015619,7017109,"which you are...","The Hateful Eight"
"1853",7018739,7019707,"then you killed Minnie.","The Hateful Eight"
"1854",7019819,7021743,"And Sweet Dave.","The Hateful Eight"
"1855",7040180,7042581,"Four measly bullets,","The Hateful Eight"
"1856",7042699,7045828,"and there goes Senor Bob.","The Hateful Eight"
"1857",7047460,7050782,"But that still don't get us no closer","The Hateful Eight"
"1858",7050899,7054268,"to which one of y'allpoisoned the coffee, though.","The Hateful Eight"
"1859",7054380,7055426,"Do it, Chris?","The Hateful Eight"
"1860",7055579,7057547,"No, it sure don't.","The Hateful Eight"
"1861",7063579,7065900,"Now, one of y'all poisoned this coffee","The Hateful Eight"
"1862",7066020,7067430,"to free Daisy.","The Hateful Eight"
"1863",7067539,7069224,"If I don't hear a confession","The Hateful Eight"
"1864",7069340,7072469,"from one of you motherfuckersquick, fast and in a hurry,","The Hateful Eight"
"1865",7072579,7075150,"I'm gonna pour this whole pot of coffee","The Hateful Eight"
"1866",7075260,7077865,"down that bitch's goddamn throat.","The Hateful Eight"
"1867",7079180,7082342,"Okay. Time's up.","The Hateful Eight"
"1868",7082460,7083746,"Stop!","The Hateful Eight"
"1869",7083899,7085788,"All right, I did it.","The Hateful Eight"
"1870",7085899,7087823,"It was me. I poisoned the coffee.","The Hateful Eight"
"1871",7088939,7091909,"I fuckin' knew it!","The Hateful Eight"
"1872",7092020,7093465,"Oh!","The Hateful Eight"

"1878",7104899,7106583,"Warren, can I kill him?","The Hateful Eight"

"2330",8839579,8840467,"Oh!","The Hateful Eight"
"2331",8840579,8842149,"Oh, sh... Oh, sh...","The Hateful Eight"
"2332",8842260,8845069,"Well, then, if I die in the next two days,","The Hateful Eight"
"2333",8845180,8847706,"which is more than likely, you can have me.","The Hateful Eight"
"2334",8847819,8850664,"Under the name of English Pete Hicox,","The Hateful Eight"

"2343",8876540,8879986,"He worth ten, just like Daisy.","The Hateful Eight"
"2344",8880100,8882182,"Well, remind me...","The Hateful Eight"
"2345",8882299,8887466,"why we wouldn't just kill all y'all, cash in.","The Hateful Eight"
"2346",8887620,8890862,"Oh, you can kill us all,but you'll never spend a cent","The Hateful Eight"
"2347",8890979,8892265,"of that bounty money,","The Hateful Eight"
"2348",8892420,8894787,"and you'll never leave this mountain alive.","The Hateful Eight"
"2349",8894899,8897220,"'Cause when that snow melts,the rest of Jody's gang,","The Hateful Eight"
"2350",8897379,8901430,"all 15 of 'em that are waitingin Red Rock, are coming here.","The Hateful Eight"
"2351",8901540,8904271,"Now, let's say you shoot us all.","The Hateful Eight"
"2352",8904379,8907986,"If you really want all thatDomingre Gang bounty money,","The Hateful Eight"
"2353",8908139,8911144,"you still got to getall our corpses into Red Rock.","The Hateful Eight"
"2354",8911260,8913422,"And that ain't gonna be so easy.","The Hateful Eight"
"2355",8913540,8915781,"'Cause I doubt you can drivea four-horse team.","The Hateful Eight"
"2356",8915940,8918750,"And that wagon out there istoo heavy for a two-horse team.","The Hateful Eight"
"2357",8918899,8923550,"So that means you're gonna have to leada string of horses into Red Rock.","The Hateful Eight"
"2358",8923700,8925986,"And with that deep snow after a blizzard,","The Hateful Eight"
"2359",8926100,8928387,"you ain't gonna be ableto get away with any more than,","The Hateful Eight"
"2360",8928500,8930582,"say, one body per horse.","The Hateful Eight"
"2361",8930700,8936503,"So that's you leading a stringof four horses into Red Rock.","The Hateful Eight"
"2362",8936620,8940102,"And with all them horses in that snow","The Hateful Eight"
"2363",8940219,8943224,"and you all by your lonesome,you're gonna be a mite poky.","The Hateful Eight"
"2364",8943340,8945661,"And you're gonna run smack dabinto the Domingre Gang.","The Hateful Eight"
"2365",8945780,8947702,"And again, Grouch, how many is that?","The Hateful Eight"
"2366",8947819,8949184,"15 killers strong.","The Hateful Eight"

"2368",8954180,8956022,"in possession of all our dead bodies,","The Hateful Eight"
"2369",8956139,8958506,"they ain't just gonnakill you and that nigger!","The Hateful Eight"
"2370",8958620,8960542,"They gonna go back to Red Rock","The Hateful Eight"
"2371",8960659,8964141,"and kill every son of a bitch in that town!","The Hateful Eight"
"2372",8964260,8966148,"You really the sheriff of Red Rock?","The Hateful Eight"
"2373",8966260,8968342,"You want to save the town?","The Hateful Eight"
"2374",8968459,8970030,"Then shoot that nigger dead!","The Hateful Eight"

"1539",7162090,7166208,"It was enough adrenalineto do the job a few times over.","Million Dollar Baby"
"1540",7166290,7168645,"He didn't want her going through this again.","Million Dollar Baby"
"1541",7216370,7218804,"Then he walked out.","Million Dollar Baby"
"1542",7218890,7221484,"I don't think he had anything left.","Million Dollar Baby"
"1543",7239530,7242442,"I went back to the gym","Million Dollar Baby"

"1555",7330170,7332638,"I'd hoped he'd gone to find you","Million Dollar Baby"
"1556",7332730,7335722,"and ask you one more time to forgive him,","Million Dollar Baby"
"1557",7335810,7338961,"but maybe he didn't haveanything left in his heart.","Million Dollar Baby"
"1558",7339050,7342804,"I just hope he found someplacewhere he could find a little peace.","Million Dollar Baby"

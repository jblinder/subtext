"396",2140555,2144766,"How often has one of us been nabbed'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?","M"
"397",2145226,2146852,"Now they can rat on the cops!","M"

"407",2186767,2188310,"He's not even a real crook!","M"
"408",2188603,2191062,"This man may well be...","M"
"409",2191772,2195567,"when not engagedin the actual act of killing...","M"
"410",2196611,2200530,"a harmless, upstanding citizen","M"
"411",2200656,2202157,"who wouldn't hurt a fly.","M"
"412",2202283,2205952,"In his right mind, perhaps he playsmarbles with his landlady's kids","M"
"413",2206078,2208288,"or plays cards with friends.","M"
"414",2208414,2212167,"Without what I'll call","M"
"415",2212335,2215170,"the innocuousnessof these murderers' private lives,","M"
"416",2215296,2219799,"it's inconceivable that someonelike Grossmann or Haarmann","M"
"417",2219926,2224137,"could have lived right next doorto their neighbors for years","M"
"418",2224472,2228141,"without arousingthe faintest trace of suspicion!","M"
"419",2228309,2231311,"This is where we must focusthe public's attention.","M"
"420",2231437,2233647,"The public must cooperate.","M"
"421",2234065,2237192,"I'll tell you about public cooperation!","M"
"422",2237610,2240445,"Just thinking of it makes me puke.","M"
"423",2241697,2243448,"I beg your pardon, Commissioner.","M"
"424",2243574,2246910,"But ain't it the truth?","M"
"425",2247870,2251331,"What the devil has public cooperationgotten us so far?","M"
"426",2253751,2256503,"Piles of lettersfull of the most outrageous slander!","M"
"427",2256629,2258004,"Very true.","M"
"428",2258172,2261258,"They alert homicidewhenever a chimney sweep walks by.","M"
"429",2261384,2262717,"That's right.","M"
"430",2262843,2265804,"But when you really wantreliable information from them,","M"
"431",2266639,2268556,"then they suddenly haven't got a clue.","M"
"432",2268933,2272394,"Why, they just can't seemto remember a thing.","M"
"433",2273896,2276856,"There's your public cooperationfor you!","M"
"434",2277942,2280860,"I believe you're exaggerating a bit,Lohmann.","M"
"435",2281862,2284322,"It can't really be that bad, can it?","M"
"436",2284824,2287367,"But it is, Commissioner!","M"
"437",2287868,2291705,"Most of the publicstill takes the position,","M"
"438",2291914,2293915,"""How does this concern me?""","M"
"439",2294750,2298795,"The idea thateach individual is responsible","M"
"440",2298921,2302882,"for what happens to the poorest,most anonymous child on the street","M"
"441",2303050,2306845,"hasn't even dawnedon the public at large!","M"
"442",2310224,2311850,"I've got another idea.","M"
"443",2311976,2313893,"There was this magician.","M"
"444",2314020,2317564,"Te... Tele...I can't remember what you call it.","M"
"445",2317857,2320942,"Anyway, he could conjure uphidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.","M"
"446",2321068,2324112,"The reward is stillfar too little money.","M"
"447",2325906,2330744,"The man who leads usto the murderer should get a fortune.","M"
"448",2330911,2333288,"None of this is anything new.","M"
"449",2333414,2335206,"This is all leading nowhere.","M"
"450",2335708,2339586,"So we just wait for the policeto catch the guy instead?","M"
"451",2342590,2346426,"The difficultiesin solving crimes of this nature","M"
"452",2346552,2349888,"are, in my experience,often insurmountable,","M"
"453",2350431,2352724,"since perpetrator and victim","M"
"454",2352850,2356519,"are often brought togetherby mere chance.","M"
"455",2356812,2360357,"The instincts of the momentdrive the murderer's actions.","M"
"456",2360608,2364235,"The victim is found and identified,","M"
"457",2364612,2366780,"his or her last known whereaboutsare determined,","M"
"458",2366947,2368656,"and then...","M"
"459",2369909,2373119,"then comes the big question mark.","M"
"460",2374789,2377540,"These children vanishwithout a trace.","M"
"461",2380252,2382712,"And when they're found...","M"
"462",2386425,2391179,"Well, we all know the statein which we've found them.","M"
"463",2393808,2395850,"And the perpetrator...","M"
"464",2398145,2400105,"It's a fact well-known to all of us","M"
"465",2400231,2404234,"that murderers like thisrarely leave a clue behind.","M"
"466",2404693,2408655,"That's what makes our work so hard,our successes so few.","M"
"467",2408781,2412367,"The police have been afterthis murderer for eight months now.","M"
"468",2413953,2417205,"They'll only get him by accident now.- We can't wait for that.","M"
"469",2417373,2419833,"No, we'll go broke by then.","M"
"470",2420000,2421126,"What, then?","M"
"471",2438561,2440437,"We have to catch him...","M"
"472",2441647,2443189,"ourselves.","M"
"473",2447903,2450405,"Yes, that's what we must do.","M"
"474",2451740,2456119,"There is perhaps one other way.","M"
"475",2456662,2459747,"I'm quite certain that informationon the individual in question","M"

"978",5943020,5944979,"You'll even have defense counsel.","M"
"979",5946273,5948399,"Everything accordingto the letter of the law.","M"
"980",5948859,5950693,"Defense counsel?","M"
"981",5950861,5953821,"I need no defense counsel!Who's gonna prosecute me?","M"
"982",5954114,5955907,"You, perhaps?","M"
"983",5958535,5959410,"Hey, you.","M"
"984",5959662,5963706,"If I were you,I wouldn't make big speeches.","M"

"987",5973050,5978096,"I have the dubious pleasureof serving as your defense.","M"
"988",5979014,5981432,"Though I'm afraidit won't do you much good.","M"
"989",5983477,5987647,"Do you all want to kill me?You want to just wipe me out?","M"
"990",5988232,5991859,"We simply want to put youout of commission.","M"
"991",5992861,5995279,"And we'll only be sureof that when you're dead.","M"
"992",5995406,5998449,"But you can't murder mejust like that!","M"
"993",6001161,6004747,"I demand to be handed overto the police!","M"
"994",6008085,6012880,"I demand to be broughtbefore a real court of law!","M"
"995",6014133,6015883,"That's a good one!","M"

"997",6018762,6021723,"So you can plead insanity","M"
"998",6021890,6025018,"and spend the rest of your lifebeing cared for by the state.","M"
"999",6025227,6028980,"And then you break out of the asylumor receive a pardon,","M"
"1000",6029356,6032734,"and you're happy as can be,free to kill with impunity,","M"
"1001",6033277,6036821,"protected by lawon grounds of insanity...","M"
"1002",6037197,6041159,"and you're back to chasing little children!No, no more of that!","M"
"1003",6041702,6044287,"You must be taken out of action!You must go!","M"
"1004",6045289,6048207,"But I can't help it!","M"
"1005",6053464,6054797,"I can't...","M"

"1007",6062765,6064182,"We know that one!","M"
"1008",6064808,6067143,"Before the judge,we all ""can't help it.""","M"
"1009",6074026,6075902,"What would you know?","M"
"1010",6076195,6078196,"What are you talking about?","M"
"1011",6078614,6080948,"Who are you anyway?","M"
"1012",6081825,6083367,"Who are you?","M"
"1013",6083786,6085745,"All of you.","M"
"1014",6086080,6087747,"Criminals.","M"
"1015",6088874,6091584,"Probably proud of it, too...","M"
"1016",6091919,6094003,"proud you can crack a safe","M"
"1017",6094171,6097131,"or sneak into housesor cheat at cards.","M"
"1018",6097382,6101344,"All of which it seems to meyou could just as easily give up","M"
"1019",6101720,6104097,"if you had learned something useful,","M"
"1020",6104223,6106182,"or if you had jobs","M"
"1021",6106391,6108935,"or if you weren't such lazy pigs.","M"
"1022",6110395,6112021,"But me?","M"
"1023",6112356,6115358,"Can I do anything about it?","M"
"1024",6116527,6120530,"Don't I havethis cursed thing inside me?","M"
"1025",6121532,6124700,"This fire, this voice, this agony?","M"
"1026",6128497,6130873,"So you mean to say...","M"
"1027",6131750,6133793,"you have to kill?","M"
"1028",6138590,6141801,"I have to roam the streets endlessly,","M"
"1029",6142427,6144470,"always sensing","M"
"1030",6144930,6147640,"that someone's following me.","M"
"1031",6147766,6149392,"It's me!","M"
"1032",6149768,6151727,"I'm shadowing myself!","M"
"1033",6153063,6154897,"Silently...","M"
"1034",6155399,6157400,"but I still hear it!","M"
"1035",6157818,6162155,"Yes, sometimes I feel","M"
"1036",6162281,6164282,"like I'm tracking myself down.","M"
"1037",6164992,6168077,"I want to run...run away from myself!","M"
"1038",6168495,6170913,"But I can't!I can't escape from myself!","M"
"1039",6171748,6174917,"I must take the paththat it's driving me down","M"
"1040",6175085,6179839,"and run and rundown endless streets!","M"
"1041",6180090,6182175,"I want off!","M"
"1042",6183927,6187221,"And with me run the ghosts","M"
"1043",6187598,6191017,"of the mothers and children.","M"
"1044",6191143,6194896,"They never go away.They're always there!","M"
"1045",6195105,6196606,"Always!","M"
"1046",6196732,6198441,"Always!","M"
"1047",6199610,6201194,"Except...","M"
"1048",6201778,6203779,"when I'm doing it...","M"
"1049",6204656,6207033,"when I...","M"
"1050",6214208,6216834,"Then I don't remember a thing.","M"
"1051",6217794,6222215,"Then I'm standing before a poster,","M"
"1052",6222341,6224884,"reading what I've done.","M"
"1053",6225135,6227178,"I read and read...","M"
"1054",6227930,6229847,"I did that?","M"
"1055",6230474,6232600,"I don't remember a thing!","M"
"1056",6233727,6235645,"But who will believe me?","M"
"1057",6235812,6238814,"Who knows what it's like inside me?","M"
"1058",6238941,6243819,"How it screams and cries outinside me when I have to do it!","M"
"1059",6244488,6246155,"Don't want to! Must!","M"
"1060",6246490,6248783,"Don't want to! Must!","M"
"1061",6249493,6252453,"And then a voice cries out,","M"
"1062",6252579,6254997,"and I can't listen anymore!","M"
"1063",6255290,6258209,"Help! I can't!","M"
"1064",6258502,6261837,"I can't!","M"
"1065",6267219,6269428,"The accused has stated","M"
"1066",6269846,6271931,"that he can't help himself.","M"
"1067",6272432,6276227,"In other words,he must commit murder.","M"
"1068",6278397,6281190,"With that he has pronouncedhis own death sentence.","M"
"1069",6281358,6282692,"Right!","M"
"1070",6282859,6285152,"A man who claims","M"
"1071",6285946,6289240,"that he's compelledto destroy the lives of others...","M"
"1072",6289700,6293452,"such a man must beextinguished like a bonfire!","M"
"1073",6293620,6295663,"Such a man must be obliterated!","M"
"1074",6295831,6297373,"Wiped out!","M"
"1075",6306550,6308759,"May I address the court?","M"
"1076",6309136,6311178,"Counsel for the defensehas the floor.","M"
"1077",6313598,6317560,"My learned colleaguewho just spoke...","M"
"1078",6318895,6321230,"who is, if I'm not mistaken,","M"
"1079",6321481,6324358,"wanted by the policeon three counts of manslaughter...","M"
"1080",6324484,6326694,"That's irrelevant here.","M"
"1081",6326903,6328404,"has claimed","M"
"1082",6328697,6331824,"that the fact that my clientwas acting compulsively","M"
"1083",6331950,6333743,"warrants the death sentence.","M"
"1084",6333994,6335828,"That's right!","M"
"1085",6336413,6337788,"He is mistaken,","M"
"1086",6338123,6342084,"because the very nature of compulsionwarrants an acquittal!","M"
"1087",6342252,6343794,"Get outta here, will ya?","M"
"1088",6344713,6345963,"Are you nuts, or plastered?","M"
"1089",6346089,6347882,"lt is preciselythe nature of compulsion","M"
"1090",6348008,6351594,"that relieves himof responsibility for his actions!","M"
"1091",6352012,6355556,"And a man cannot be punished for that","M"
"1092",6355682,6357141,"for which he is not responsible!","M"
"1093",6357267,6361812,"- Ridiculous!- You mean this monster should go free?","M"
"1094",6361938,6363606,"That he should live?","M"
"1095",6363732,6367109,"I'm saying that this man is sick,","M"
"1096",6367235,6371197,"and you turn a sick manover to a doctor, not an executioner.","M"
"1097",6371323,6375451,"- Will you guarantee his cure?- What does the state build asylums for?","M"
"1098",6375619,6379455,"- What if he breaks out?- Or he's declared cured and released?","M"
"1099",6379581,6381999,"And one fine daythe killing starts all over?","M"
"1100",6382667,6384460,"Another month-long manhunt!","M"
"1101",6384586,6386545,"Once again the insanity clause,once again the asylum!","M"
"1102",6386671,6390132,"Another breakout or possible release!And again... ""must kill""!","M"
"1103",6390842,6393719,"Is this supposedto go on indefinitely?","M"
"1104",6393887,6399225,"No one has the right to kill a man","M"
"1105",6399351,6401352,"who cannot be heldresponsible for his crimes!","M"
"1106",6401603,6403187,"Not even the state,","M"
"1107",6403480,6406273,"and all of you least of all!","M"
"1108",6407234,6412113,"The state must ensurethat this man is rendered harmless","M"
"1109",6412447,6416992,"so that he ceases to bea danger to society!","M"
"1110",6420705,6422998,"You never had kids, did ya?","M"
"1111",6423125,6425209,"Then you never lost any either.","M"
"1112",6426837,6429380,"But if you wanna know what it's like","M"
"1113",6429506,6432508,"when a little child is taken from you,","M"
"1114",6432634,6435928,"just ask the parentswhose kids he took away!","M"
"1115",6436680,6441725,"Ask 'em about the days and nightsnot knowing what had happened,","M"
"1116",6442477,6445146,"and later,when they finally found out...","M"
"1117",6446815,6449275,"Why don't you ask the mothers?","M"
"1118",6449443,6451735,"You should ask the mothers!","M"
"1119",6452028,6454071,"Think you'd get mercyfrom any of them","M"
"1120",6454197,6456365,"for murdering their kids?","M"
"1121",6456533,6458242,"- The woman's right!- Absolutely!","M"
"1122",6458368,6460369,"No mercy for the killer!","M"
"1123",6460495,6462204,"- Let him have it!- Slaughter the bastard!","M"
"1124",6462330,6465207,"- Kill the monster!- Kill him!","M"
"1125",6465375,6467376,"- Put the animal to death!- Rub him out!","M"
"1126",6467544,6469420,"- Kill him!- Waste him!","M"
"1127",6469546,6473382,"- Get rid of him!- Annihilate the monster!","M"
"1128",6474551,6477887,"I will not let you shout me down!","M"
"1129",6481475,6488063,"I will not allow a murderto be committed in my presence.","M"
"1130",6488398,6491317,"I demand that this human being...","M"
"1131",6491568,6492860,"That's not a human being!","M"
"1132",6492986,6496280,"that this human being be affordedthe same protection under the law","M"
"1133",6496531,6498199,"rendered the common criminal!","M"
"1134",6498408,6499909,"Not a chance!","M"
"1135",6500076,6503579,"I demand that he behanded over to the police!","M"
"1136",6503705,6506916,"The police!Of all the dumb...","M"
"1137",6533944,6535778,"In the name of the law...","M"
"1138",6559469,6561136,"In the name of the people...","M"
"1139",6561304,6565891,"This will not bringour children back.","M"
"1140",6570939,6572898,"One has to...","M"
"1141",6573567,6575401,"keep closer watch...","M"
"1142",6576820,6579488,"over the children!","M"

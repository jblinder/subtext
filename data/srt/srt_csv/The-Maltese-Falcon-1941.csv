"999",3690101,3692271,"It was only a black enameled figureto him...","The Maltese Falcon"

"1021",3755487,3758032,"Will you believe me if I namethe probable minimum?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1022",3758157,3759282,"Why not?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1023",3759489,3762034,"What would you sayto a quarter of a million?","The Maltese Falcon"

"1159",4498746,4499788,"Really, I do.","The Maltese Falcon"

"1161",4502873,4506167,"what in the world would keep Wilmerfrom telling the police...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1162",4506252,4508712,"every last detail aboutthe falcon and all-","The Maltese Falcon"
"1163",4508837,4510171,"Let him talk his head off.","The Maltese Falcon"

"1174",4538694,4543239,"If you're really serious, the least we cando in common politeness is to hear you out.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1175",4543364,4547993,"Now, how would you be able to fix itso that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1176",4548536,4551121,"I can show Bryan, our DA,that if he goes around...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1177",4551203,4554082,"tryin' to collect everybodyhe'll have a tangled case...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1178",4554207,4557877,"but if he sticks to Wilmer here,he can get a conviction...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1179",4558168,4559878,"standing on his head.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1180",4563131,4564756,"Get up on your feet.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1181",4564882,4567676,"I've taken all the riding from youI'm gonna take.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1182",4568135,4569636,"Get up and shoot it out!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1183",4569720,4571386,"Young Wild West!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1184",4571554,4574681,"You should tell him shootin' mebefore you get the falcon...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1185",4574806,4576015,"will be bad for business.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1186",4576140,4578685,"Now, now, Wilmer.We can't have any of that.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1187",4578810,4581270,"You shouldn't attach such importanceto these things.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1188",4581395,4582896,"Tell him to lay off me then.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1189",4582979,4584273,"Now, Wilmer...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1190",4586565,4591194,"Your plan is, not at all satisfactory, sir.Let's not say anything more about it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1191",4591319,4593363,"All right. I've got another suggestion.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1192",4593488,4596364,"Maybe not as good as the first,but it's better than nothing.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1193",4596489,4597490,"Want to hear it?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1194",4597574,4598993,"Most assuredly.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1195",4603246,4604622,"Give them Cairo.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1196",4605331,4606539,"Well, by gad, sir-","The Maltese Falcon"
"1197",4606623,4609251,"Suppose we give themyou or Miss O'Shaughnessy?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1198",4609335,4611127,"You want the falcon. I've got it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1199",4611252,4614880,"The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking.As for Miss O'Shaughnessy...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1200",4614962,4618841,"if you think she can be rigged for thepart I'm willing to discuss it with you.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1201",4618926,4622720,"You seem to forget that you are notin a position to insist upon anything.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1202",4622802,4624012,"Now, come, gentlemen.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1203",4624095,4626722,"Let's keep our discussionon a friendly basis.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1204",4627474,4630516,"There certainly is somethingin what Mr. Cairo said...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1205",4631185,4634270,"If you kill me,how are you gonna get the bird?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1206",4634729,4638565,"If I know you can't afford to kill me,how'll you scare me into giving it to you?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1207",4638690,4642778,"Sir, there are other means of persuasionbesides killing and threatening to kill.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1208",4642860,4644154,"Yes, that's...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1209",4645529,4646655,"That's true.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1210",4648532,4652534,"But none of them are any goodunless the threat of death is behind them.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1211",4652618,4653869,"You see what I mean?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1212",4653994,4658623,"If you start something, I'll make it a matterof your having to kill me or call it off.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1213",4659957,4664168,"That's an attitude, sir, that calls forthe most delicate judgement on both sides.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1214",4664293,4666505,"Because, as you know,in the heat of action...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1215",4666587,4669547,"men are likely to forget wheretheir best interests lie...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1216",4669673,4671926,"and let their emotions carry them away.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1217",4672051,4675261,"And the trick from my angle isto make my play strong enough...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1218",4675386,4678264,"to tie you up, not make you mad enoughto bump me off...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1219",4678390,4679711,"against your better judgement.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1220",4679722,4682100,"By gad, sir, you are a character.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1221",4687979,4690774,"They're selling you out, sonny.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1222",4691399,4693818,"I hope you're not influenced by the guns...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1223",4693900,4696737,"these pocket-edition desperadoesare waving around.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1224",4696820,4699988,"Because I've practiced taking guns awayfrom these boys before...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1225",4700073,4702199,"so we'll have no trouble there.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1226",4702742,4704118,"- Wilmer, here-- All right.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1227",4704243,4705202,"Wilmer!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1228",4737603,4738979,"There's our fall guy.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1229",4739104,4742274,"Either say yes right nowor I'll turn the falcon and all of you in.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1230",4742356,4743649,"I don't like that, sir.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1231",4743731,4745900,"Well, you won't like it. Well?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1232",4750697,4752282,"You can have him.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1233",4753865,4756702,"I won't be able to get the falcontill daylight, maybe later.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1234",4756784,4759912,"It'd be best for us allif we didn't leave each other's sight...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1235",4760037,4763372,"until our business has been transacted.You have the envelope?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1236",4763497,4765667,"Miss O'Shaughnessy has it. Hang on to it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1237",4765792,4769086,"We won't lose sight of each other.The dingus'll be brought to us here.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1238",4769211,4770796,"Excellent, sir, excellent!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1239",4770880,4773172,"Then in exchange forthe $10,000 and Wilmer...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1240",4773297,4775884,"you'll give us the falconand an hour or two of grace.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1241",4776009,4778342,"Now, let's get the details fixed, first.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1242",4778467,4782762,"Why did he shoot Thursby and why, whereand how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1243",4782889,4786850,"I've got to know all that happenedso the parts that don't fit are covered up.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1244",4786934,4788976,"I shall be candid with you, sir.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1245",4789060,4791270,"Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1246",4791395,4793689,"We believed that disposing of himas we did...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1247",4793771,4797692,"would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stopand think that it would be best...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1248",4797817,4801069,"to patch up her differences with usregarding the falcon.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1249",4801320,4804238,"You didn't try to make a dealbefore giving him the works?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1250",4804323,4806533,"We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1251",4806658,4810077,"I talked to him myself that very night,but I could do nothing with him.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1252",4810161,4813162,"He was quite determinedly loyalto Miss O'Shaughnessy.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1253",4814331,4817707,"So Wilmer followed him back to the hoteland did what he did.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1254",4818333,4819877,"That sounds all right.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1255",4821002,4822295,"Now, Jacoby.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1256",4823837,4827673,"Captain Jacoby's death was entirelyMiss O'Shaughnessy's fault.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1257",4829091,4830344,"Tell me what happened.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1258",4830426,4832886,"Cairo, as you must have surmised,contacted me...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1259",4833011,4835847,"after he left police headquarterslast night or morning.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1260",4835931,4838891,"He recognized the mutual advantageof pooling forces.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1261",4839350,4841560,"Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgement.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1262",4841936,4845355,"The Paloma was his thought.He read of its arrival in the papers...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1263",4845439,4847731,"and remembered he had heardin Hong Kong...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1264",4847856,4851027,"that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessywere seen together...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1265",4854279,4856280,"Well, sir, he saw that notice and...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1266",4856364,4858908,"putting two and two togetherguessed the truth.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1267",4859033,4861702,"She had given the bird to Jacobyto bring here for her.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1268",4861786,4864203,"And at that juncture you decidedto slip me a Mickey.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1269",4864287,4866706,"There's no place for you in our plan, sir.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1270",4866788,4870083,"So we decided to spare ourselvesany possible embarrassment.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1271",4871335,4874503,"Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I wentto call on Captain Jacoby.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1272",4875212,4878547,"We were lucky enough to arrivewhile Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1273",4878673,4882092,"In many ways, the conference was difficult,but we finally persuaded...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1274",4882217,4885261,"Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms,or so we thought.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1275",4885387,4887764,"We then left the boat and set outfor my hotel...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1276",4887889,4891309,"where I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessyand receive the bird.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1277",4891475,4894060,"Well, sir, we mere menshould have known better.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1278",4894144,4896688,"En route, she, Captain Jacobyand the falcon...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1279",4896813,4899231,"slipped completely through our fingers.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1280",4899649,4902067,"It was neatly done, sir. Indeed, it was.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1281",4902984,4905112,"You touched off the boat before you left?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1282",4905237,4906612,"No, not intentionally.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1283",4906737,4910448,"Though, we, or Wilmer at least,were responsible for the fire.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1284",4910533,4915036,"While the rest of us were talkingin the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1285",4915578,4917453,"trying to find the falcon.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1286",4918413,4920623,"No doubt, he was careless with matches.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1287",4920748,4922250,"And how about the shooting?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1288",4922332,4925837,"We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessyand Jacoby at her apartment.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1289",4925920,4929922,"I sent Wilmer downstairs to coverthe fire escape before ringing the bell.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1290",4930423,4933926,"And, sure enough, while she was asking uswho we were through the door...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1291",4934009,4936677,"and we were telling her,we heard a window go up.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1292",4936761,4939805,"Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was comingdown the fire escape...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1293",4939930,4943850,"shot him more than once, but Jacobywas too tough to fall or drop the falcon.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1294",4943934,4947770,"He climbed down the rest of the way,knocked Wilmer over, and ran off.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1295",4949271,4952940,"We persuaded, that is the word, sir,we persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1296",4953024,4956068,"to tell us where she told Captain Jacobyto take the falcon.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1297",4956193,4958612,"We further persuaded herto phone your office...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1298",4958695,4961823,"in an attempt to draw you away,before Jacoby got there...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1299",4961948,4963490,"but unfortunately for us...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1300",4963615,4966827,"it had taken us too longto persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1301",4967034,4969037,"You had the falconbefore we could reach you.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1302",4984632,4987467,"Wilmer, I'm sorry to lose you,but I want you to know...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1303",4987594,4990262,"I couldn't be fonder of youif you were my own son.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1304",4990387,4993390,"Well, if you lose a son,it's possible to get another.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1305",4993931,4995932,"There's only one Maltese Falcon.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1306",4997393,5000686,"When you're young,you simply don't understand these things.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1307",5002730,5004024,"How about some coffee?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1308",5004149,5005315,"Put the pot on, will you?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1309",5005399,5007484,"I don't like to leave our guests.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1310",5007902,5008694,"Surely.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1311",5008819,5012613,"Just a moment, my dear. Hadn't youbetter leave the envelope in here?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1312",5014407,5018201,"- Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.- You misunderstand me. It's not that.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1313",5018327,5021746,"But business should be transactedin a businesslike manner.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1314",5023581,5026541,"For instance,there are only nine bills here now.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1315",5026666,5030168,"There were 10 when I handed them to you,as you very well know.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1316",5037007,5037841,"Well?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1317",5038176,5039844,"I want to know about this.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1318",5047766,5048975,"You palmed it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1319",5049185,5050268,"- I palmed it?- Yes.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1320",5050351,5052395,"Do you want to say so,or stand for a frisk?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1321",5052520,5055730,"You'll admit it, or I'll search you.There's no third way.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1322",5055898,5057483,"I believe you would. I really do.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1323",5057608,5059608,"You're a character,if you don't mind my saying so.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1324",5059693,5060944,"You palmed it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1325",5061694,5063363,"Yes, sir, that I did.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1326",5068367,5070576,"I must have my little joke now and then.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1327",5070701,5073746,"I was curious to know what you'd doin a situation like this.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1328",5073871,5076163,"I must say you passed the testwith flying colors.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1329",5076247,5078667,"That's something I'd expectfrom someone Wilmer's age.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1330",5078792,5081502,"This will soon be yours.You might as well take it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1331",5081627,5083252,"I ought to have more than $10,000.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1332",5083378,5085671,"You understand this is the first payment.Later.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1333",5085796,5088466,"Oh, yes. Later you'll give me millions,but...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1334",5088548,5090300,"how's about $15,000 now?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1335",5090801,5094136,"Frankly and candidly,upon my word of honor as a gentleman...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1336",5094636,5097014,"$10,000 is all the money I can raise.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1337",5098474,5100391,"But you didn't say positively.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1338",5100809,5101893,"Positively.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1339",5107398,5109649,"I'd like to give you a word of advice.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1340",5109731,5110774,"Go ahead.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1341",5112402,5113903,"You'll give her some money...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1342",5113985,5118573,"but if you don't give her what shethinks she should have, be careful.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1343",5122409,5123493,"Dangerous?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1344",5124411,5125369,"Very.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1345",5126662,5129622,"- How's the coffee coming, angel?- In a few minutes.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1346",5129747,5131707,"It's almost daylight, Mr. Spade.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1347",5132333,5134210,"Can you start getting it now?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1348",5134668,5135795,"I guess so.","The Maltese Falcon"

"1374",5347671,5350216,"Kemidov found out how valuable it was!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1375",5350841,5353092,"No wonder we hadsuch an easy time stealing it!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1376",5353176,5354636,"You... you imbecile!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1377",5354761,5356387,"You bloated idiot!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1378",5357095,5358930,"You stupid fathead, you!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1379",5387453,5390497,"Yes, it's the Russian's hand.There's no doubt about it.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1380",5390582,5391832,"What do you suggest...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1381",5391957,5394667,"we stand here, shed tearsand call each other names...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1382",5394751,5396668,"or shall we go to Istanbul?","The Maltese Falcon"

"1390",5436576,5438161,"A swell lot of thieves.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1391",5438243,5441371,"We've little to boast about,but the world hasn't come to an end...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1392",5441496,5443457,"just because we've run into a setback.","The Maltese Falcon"

"1394",5447001,5449295,"It's your hard luckit wasn't what you wanted.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1395",5449420,5451378,"Now, come, sir, we've all failed...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1396",5451503,5455466,"and there's no reason for expectingany of us to bear the whole brunt.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1397",5455757,5458469,"In short, sir, I mustask you for my $10,000.","The Maltese Falcon"

"1414",5534404,5536572,"He's working for a man namedKasper Gutman.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1415",5536655,5539283,"You can't miss Gutman.He must weigh 300 pounds.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1416",5539408,5541243,"That fellow Cairo's in with him, too.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1417",5541326,5543119,"They just left for the Alexandria Hotel.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1418",5543244,5545496,"You'll have to move fast.They're blowing town.","The Maltese Falcon"

"1420",5547832,5549498,"Yes, that's right. Very.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1421",5549582,5551126,"Well, good luck, Tom.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1422",5551251,5553461,"They'll talk when they're nailed about us.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1423",5553586,5556963,"We only have minutes to get setfor the police. Give me all of it fast!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1424",5557088,5559798,"When you first came to me,why did you want Thursby shadowed?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1425",5559923,5562051,"I thought he betrayed me.I wanted to find out.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1426",5562176,5565261,"A lie! You knew you had Thursby hooked!You wanted to kill him...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1427",5565345,5569640,"before Jacoby came with the loot so youwouldn't have to split it with him. Right?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1428",5569765,5572685,"If he knew someone was following him,he'd be frightened away.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1429",5572768,5575478,"Miles wasn't clumsy enoughto be spotted the first night.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1430",5575603,5577896,"You told Thursby he was being followed.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1431",5580439,5581567,"I told him.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1432",5583025,5584109,"I told him.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1433",5585444,5586529,"Yes, but please believe me.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1434",5586612,5588989,"I wouldn't have if I thoughtFloyd would kill him.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1435",5589113,5591490,"If you thought he wouldn't kill Miles,you were right.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1436",5591615,5593868,"Miles hadn't many brains,but too much experience...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1437",5593952,5596619,"as a detective to be caughtby a man he was shadowing...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1438",5596703,5599497,"up a blind alley with his gunand his overcoat buttoned.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1439",5599622,5601957,"But he'd have gone up therewith you, angel.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1440",5602125,5604251,"He was just dumb enough for that.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1441",5604792,5607671,"He'd have looked you up and down,licked his lips and gone...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1442",5607796,5609588,"grinning from ear to ear.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1443",5609713,5612132,"You could have stoodas close to him as you liked...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1444",5612216,5614717,"and shot him with a gun you gotfrom Thursby that night.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1445",5614801,5617595,"- Don't say that!- The police'll be here any minute! Talk!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1446",5617720,5618680,"Why do you accuse me-","The Maltese Falcon"
"1447",5618804,5622640,"It's not the time for that schoolgirl act!We're both sitting under the gallows!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1448",5622725,5624266,"Now, why did you shoot Miles?","The Maltese Falcon"
"1449",5625726,5628479,"I didn't mean to atfirst, really, I didn't.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1450",5629645,5632524,"But when I found outthat Floyd couldn't be frightened...","The Maltese Falcon"
"1451",5632649,5634649,"I can't look at you and tell you this!","The Maltese Falcon"
"1452",5634734,5637737,"You thought Thursby would tackle Milesand one would go down.","The Maltese Falcon"
"1453",5637819,5639529,"If Thursby died, you were rid of him.","The Maltese Falcon"

"134",729659,731299,"He's the Keeper of the Runners.","The Maze Runner"
"135",731360,735139,"Every morning, when those doors open,they run the maze...","The Maze Runner"
"136",735299,738610,"mapping it, memorizing it,trying to find a way out.","The Maze Runner"
"137",739940,741970,"How long have they been looking?","The Maze Runner"
"138",742940,744210,"Three years.","The Maze Runner"
"139",747110,749149,"And they haven't found anything?","The Maze Runner"

"145",766860,768840,"How is that even possible?","The Maze Runner"
"146",770029,774000,"You can ask the people who put us in here,if you ever meet the bastards.","The Maze Runner"
"147",776610,778850,"Listen, the truth is...","The Maze Runner"
"148",779009,782110,"the runners are the only oneswho really know what's out there.","The Maze Runner"
"149",782179,784490,"They are the strongestand the fastest of us all.","The Maze Runner"
"150",784549,785549,"And it's a good thing, too...","The Maze Runner"
"151",785610,787690,"because if they don't make it backbefore those doors close...","The Maze Runner"
"152",787750,790289,"then they are stuck out therefor the night.","The Maze Runner"
"153",791620,794429,"And no one has ever surviveda night in the maze.","The Maze Runner"
"154",799860,801470,"What happens to them?","The Maze Runner"
"155",805429,807409,"We call them Grievers.","The Maze Runner"
"156",809070,813309,"Of course, no one's ever seen oneand lived to tell about it.","The Maze Runner"

"170",855720,857629,"What if I want to be a runner?","The Maze Runner"
"171",858620,861759,"Have you listened to a word I've just said?No one wants to be a runner.","The Maze Runner"
"172",861820,863889,"And, besides, you gotta get chosen.","The Maze Runner"

"474",2646969,2648610,"it is that you do not...","The Maze Runner"
"475",2663389,2664889,"Okay, wait. I know that sound.","The Maze Runner"

"507",2825449,2827929,"You just got outand now you want back in?","The Maze Runner"
"508",2828820,2832900,"Newt said that no one has ever seen aGriever and lived to tell about it, right?","The Maze Runner"
"509",2832960,2835409,"Minho, now we have one.","The Maze Runner"
"510",2835559,2838630,"You're telling meyou're not even a little bit curious?","The Maze Runner"

"516",2853380,2855550,"The other runners quit this morning.","The Maze Runner"
"517",2857920,2861690,"After Alby got stung, they're notin any hurry to get back out there.","The Maze Runner"
"518",2863059,2864929,"Why are you?","The Maze Runner"
"519",2866559,2869840,"I think it's time we find outwhat we're really up against.","The Maze Runner"
"520",2873369,2874710,"All right.","The Maze Runner"
"521",2874869,2877179,"But you're not going back out there alone.","The Maze Runner"

"528",2954610,2956420,"There's something in there.","The Maze Runner"
"529",2957150,2959360,"You mean, besides a Griever pancake?","The Maze Runner"
"530",2967659,2969900,"Whoa, what are you doing?","The Maze Runner"
"531",2984940,2986949,"I thought you said it was dead.","The Maze Runner"
"532",2987309,2989789,"- Was it a reflex?- You hope.","The Maze Runner"
"533",2991949,2994360,"Okay, come on.Let's try and pull it out.","The Maze Runner"
"534",2994820,2996559,"Everyone get a hand on it.Come on.","The Maze Runner"

"538",3046610,3048210,"What the hell is that?","The Maze Runner"
"539",3057480,3058590,"Interesting.","The Maze Runner"
"540",3058650,3060130,"Okay, whatever it is...","The Maze Runner"
"541",3060190,3062130,"can we take this up back at the Glade?","The Maze Runner"
"542",3062190,3064929,"Because I don't want to meetthis guy's friends.","The Maze Runner"
"543",3065059,3066469,"He's right.","The Maze Runner"
"544",3066630,3069300,"It's getting late. Come on.","The Maze Runner"
"545",3080809,3082079,"We found this.","The Maze Runner"
"546",3082579,3084820,"It was inside a Griever.","The Maze Runner"
"547",3084980,3086619,"These are the same letterswe get in our supplies.","The Maze Runner"
"548",3086679,3087750,"Yeah.","The Maze Runner"
"549",3087809,3091190,"Whoever put us hereobviously made the Grievers.","The Maze Runner"
"550",3091250,3094530,"This is the first real clue, the firstanything, you've found in over 3 years.","The Maze Runner"
"551",3094590,3097090,"- Right, Minho?- Right.","The Maze Runner"
"552",3097489,3100199,"Newt, we gotta go back out there.","The Maze Runner"
"553",3100360,3103070,"Who knows where this might lead us.","The Maze Runner"
"554",3105530,3107840,"You see what he's trying to do, right?","The Maze Runner"
"555",3108329,3109710,"First he breaks our rules...","The Maze Runner"
"556",3109769,3112840,"and then he tries to convince usto abandon them totally.","The Maze Runner"
"557",3112909,3115389,"The rules are the only thingthat have ever held us together.","The Maze Runner"
"558",3115440,3117849,"Why now are we questioning that?","The Maze Runner"
"559",3118280,3120690,"If Alby was here,you know he'd agree with me.","The Maze Runner"
"560",3120750,3123920,"This shank needs to be punished.","The Maze Runner"
"561",3131860,3133059,"You're right.","The Maze Runner"
"562",3133130,3134869,"Thomas broke the rules.","The Maze Runner"
"563",3135429,3136869,"One night in the pit,and no food.","The Maze Runner"
"564",3136929,3139639,"Come on, Newt! One night in the pit?","The Maze Runner"
"565",3139800,3142210,"Do you think that's gonna stop himfrom going into the maze?","The Maze Runner"
"566",3142269,3143440,"No.","The Maze Runner"
"567",3143599,3148110,"And we can't just have non-runners runninginto the maze whenever they feel like it.","The Maze Runner"
"568",3149139,3150710,"So let's just make this official.","The Maze Runner"
"569",3150780,3153150,"Starting from tomorrow,you're a runner.","The Maze Runner"
"570",3158480,3159489,"Wow.","The Maze Runner"
"571",3159789,3161559,"- Gally...- No, Fry.","The Maze Runner"
"572",3169329,3170599,"Thanks, Newt.","The Maze Runner"
"573",3188309,3189849,"Hey, where are we going?","The Maze Runner"
"574",3189920,3191949,"You'll see.","The Maze Runner"
"575",3219210,3220949,"It's the maze.","The Maze Runner"
"576",3222150,3223559,"All of it.","The Maze Runner"
"577",3225550,3229159,"What do you mean ""all of it""?I thought you were still mapping it.","The Maze Runner"
"578",3230019,3231869,"There's nothing left to map.","The Maze Runner"
"579",3234059,3236170,"I've run every inch of it myself.","The Maze Runner"
"580",3236230,3237710,"Every cycle.","The Maze Runner"
"581",3237860,3239340,"Every pattern.","The Maze Runner"
"582",3241500,3244539,"If there was a way out,we would have found it by now.","The Maze Runner"
"583",3246369,3248719,"Why haven't you told anyone this?","The Maze Runner"
"584",3250679,3252880,"It was Alby's call.","The Maze Runner"
"585",3253050,3256190,"People needed to believewe had a chance of getting out.","The Maze Runner"
"586",3257650,3259030,"But maybe now...","The Maze Runner"
"587",3260320,3261920,"we have a real chance.","The Maze Runner"
"588",3267159,3268659,"Take a look at this.","The Maze Runner"
"589",3269599,3272510,"About a year ago, we started exploringthese outer sections.","The Maze Runner"
"590",3272570,3275550,"We found these numbersprinted on the walls.","The Maze Runner"
"591",3275699,3278239,"Sections 1 through 8.","The Maze Runner"
"592",3278500,3282210,"See, the way it works,is every night, when the maze changes...","The Maze Runner"
"593",3282380,3284250,"it opens up a new section.","The Maze Runner"
"594",3284409,3286860,"So today, Section 6 was open.","The Maze Runner"
"595",3287010,3290690,"Tomorrow, it will be 4,then 8, then 3.","The Maze Runner"
"596",3290849,3293190,"The pattern always stays the same.","The Maze Runner"
"597",3296559,3298400,"What's so special about 7?","The Maze Runner"
"598",3298559,3300039,"I don't know.","The Maze Runner"
"599",3301059,3303699,"But last night,when you killed that Griever...","The Maze Runner"
"600",3303760,3305610,"Section 7 was open.","The Maze Runner"
"601",3305769,3308269,"I think it must be where it comes from.","The Maze Runner"
"602",3308429,3311239,"Tomorrow, you and Iare gonna take a closer look.","The Maze Runner"
"603",3312570,3313570,"Hey!","The Maze Runner"
"604",3313710,3315750,"What are you guys doing?You're not allowed in here.","The Maze Runner"

"606",3318710,3319989,"Is she awake?","The Maze Runner"
"607",3320550,3321809,"You could say that.","The Maze Runner"
"608",3322349,3324159,"Chuck, what's going on?","The Maze Runner"
"609",3324750,3326320,"Girls are awesome.","The Maze Runner"

"615",3336030,3337530,"I don't think she likes us very much.","The Maze Runner"
"616",3337599,3339519,"- What do you want from me?- We just wanna talk.","The Maze Runner"
"617",3339530,3340809,"I'm warning you!","The Maze Runner"

"927",4931960,4933399,"Wicked is good.","The Maze Runner"
"928",4934689,4935770,"How could this be my fault?","The Maze Runner"
"929",4935789,4937000,"You did this!","The Maze Runner"
"930",4937500,4938800,"I saw you!","The Maze Runner"
"931",4940630,4942979,"I can't keep watching them die.","The Maze Runner"
"932",4949010,4950489,"Hey.","The Maze Runner"
"933",4951840,4953520,"Are you okay?","The Maze Runner"
"934",4955909,4957949,"What the hell were you thinking?","The Maze Runner"
"935",4963319,4964600,"What happened?","The Maze Runner"
"936",4965220,4966930,"Gally has taken control.","The Maze Runner"
"937",4967760,4970739,"He said we had a choice.Either join him...","The Maze Runner"
"938",4970899,4973569,"or get banished at sundown with you.","The Maze Runner"
"939",4975170,4977170,"And the others agreed to that?","The Maze Runner"
"940",4978239,4982239,"Gally has everyone convinced thatyou're the reason all this has happened.","The Maze Runner"
"941",4984880,4987220,"Well, he's been right so far.","The Maze Runner"
"942",4988779,4990590,"What are you talking about?","The Maze Runner"
"943",4991279,4993060,"This place...","The Maze Runner"
"944",4993880,4996229,"it's not what we thought it was.","The Maze Runner"
"945",4997789,5000229,"It's not a prison, it's a test.","The Maze Runner"
"946",5001060,5003159,"It all started when we were kids.","The Maze Runner"
"947",5004130,5006939,"They would give us these challenges.","The Maze Runner"
"948",5007529,5010100,"They were experimenting on us.","The Maze Runner"
"949",5011199,5014270,"And then people started disappearing.","The Maze Runner"
"950",5014439,5017250,"Every month,one after the other, like clockwork.","The Maze Runner"
"951",5017579,5019989,"They were sending them up into the maze.","The Maze Runner"
"952",5020109,5022319,"Yeah, but not all of us.","The Maze Runner"
"953",5022909,5024649,"What do you mean?","The Maze Runner"
"954",5027890,5029560,"Guys, I'm one of them.","The Maze Runner"
"955",5032090,5034829,"The people who put you here,I worked with them.","The Maze Runner"
"956",5036430,5039170,"I watched you guys for years.","The Maze Runner"
"957",5039659,5042409,"The entire time you have been here...","The Maze Runner"
"958",5042569,5044600,"I was on the other side of it.","The Maze Runner"
"959",5047409,5048750,"So were you.","The Maze Runner"
"960",5050640,5051810,"What?","The Maze Runner"
"961",5053439,5055789,"Teresa, we did this to them.","The Maze Runner"
"962",5057779,5058989,"No.","The Maze Runner"
"963",5060279,5061789,"That can't be true.","The Maze Runner"
"964",5062020,5065359,"It is. I saw it.","The Maze Runner"
"965",5067090,5069800,"Why would they send us upif we were with them?","The Maze Runner"
"966",5069859,5071460,"It doesn't matter.","The Maze Runner"
"967",5072829,5074279,"He's right.","The Maze Runner"
"968",5076970,5078640,"It doesn't matter.","The Maze Runner"
"969",5079369,5081109,"Any of it.","The Maze Runner"
"970",5082310,5086279,"Because the people we were before the mazedon't even exist anymore.","The Maze Runner"
"971",5086439,5088520,"These Creators took care of that.","The Maze Runner"
"972",5089710,5093350,"But what does matter is who we are now,and what we do...","The Maze Runner"
"973",5093520,5095189,"right now.","The Maze Runner"
"974",5096220,5098930,"You went into the mazeand you found a way out.","The Maze Runner"
"975",5099189,5102329,"Yeah, but if I hadn't,Alby would still be alive.","The Maze Runner"
"976",5105729,5107210,"Maybe.","The Maze Runner"
"977",5110800,5115720,"But I know that if he were here, he wouldbe telling you the exact same thing.","The Maze Runner"
"978",5116810,5120079,"Pick your ass upand finish what you started.","The Maze Runner"
"979",5122250,5123659,"Because if we do nothing...","The Maze Runner"
"980",5123710,5127090,"then that means Alby died for nothing,and I can't have that.","The Maze Runner"
"981",5131390,5132890,"Okay.","The Maze Runner"
"982",5134659,5138159,"Okay, but we gotta get through Gally first.","The Maze Runner"
"983",5167020,5168970,"This is such a waste.","The Maze Runner"
"984",5174729,5175939,"Gally...","The Maze Runner"
"985",5180770,5182720,"It doesn't feel right, man.","The Maze Runner"
"986",5183909,5186319,"Yeah, what if Thomas is right?","The Maze Runner"
"987",5187140,5189250,"Maybe he can lead us home.","The Maze Runner"
"988",5191449,5193449,"We are home.","The Maze Runner"
"989",5194079,5195720,"Okay?","The Maze Runner"
"990",5196989,5200060,"I don't wanna have to crossany more names off that wall.","The Maze Runner"
"991",5200119,5203800,"You really think banishing usis gonna solve anything?","The Maze Runner"
"992",5204529,5205909,"No.","The Maze Runner"
"993",5207060,5209069,"But this isn't a banishing.","The Maze Runner"
"994",5210029,5211170,"It's an offering.","The Maze Runner"
"995",5211239,5215210,"What? Wait!Gally, what are you doing?","The Maze Runner"
"996",5215369,5219720,"You really think I'm gonna let Thomasback into the maze after what he has done?","The Maze Runner"
"997",5220810,5222479,"Look around you!","The Maze Runner"
"998",5223779,5225189,"Look at our Glade!","The Maze Runner"
"999",5226479,5229430,"This is the only way.","The Maze Runner"
"1000",5229590,5232899,"And when the Grievers getwhat they came here for...","The Maze Runner"
"1001",5233489,5235699,"everything goes back to the way it was.","The Maze Runner"
"1002",5235760,5237100,"Are you listening to this?","The Maze Runner"
"1003",5237159,5239640,"Why are you all just standing there?He's crazy!","The Maze Runner"
"1004",5239699,5240609,"You shut up.","The Maze Runner"
"1005",5240659,5243369,"If you stay here,the Grievers are going to come back.","The Maze Runner"
"1006",5243430,5245210,"They're gonna come back,and they're gonna keep coming back...","The Maze Runner"
"1007",5245270,5246579,"until you're all dead!","The Maze Runner"
"1008",5246640,5248449,"Shut up! Tie him up!","The Maze Runner"
"1009",5250109,5252250,"Do you hear me? I said tie him up!","The Maze Runner"
"1010",5277170,5279079,"You're full of surprises, aren't you?","The Maze Runner"
"1011",5279140,5282170,"You don't have to come with us,but we are leaving.","The Maze Runner"
"1012",5282340,5284720,"Anyone else who wants to come,now is your last chance.","The Maze Runner"
"1013",5284779,5286409,"Don't listen to him,he's just trying to scare you.","The Maze Runner"
"1014",5286479,5289250,"No, I'm not trying to scare you.You're already scared.","The Maze Runner"
"1015",5289310,5291020,"I'm scared.","The Maze Runner"
"1016",5293619,5297689,"But I'd rather risk my life out therethan spending the rest of it in here.","The Maze Runner"
"1017",5299060,5301060,"We don't belong here.","The Maze Runner"
"1018",5301659,5304399,"This place isn't our home.","The Maze Runner"
"1019",5305300,5307000,"We were put here.","The Maze Runner"
"1020",5307399,5308970,"We were trapped here.","The Maze Runner"
"1021",5310699,5312979,"At least, out there we have a choice.","The Maze Runner"
"1022",5315140,5317239,"We can make it out of here.","The Maze Runner"
"1023",5318479,5319649,"I know that.","The Maze Runner"
"1024",5332859,5334430,"I'm sorry.","The Maze Runner"

"1092",5828189,5832069,"but circumstances seemto have prevented it.","The Maze Runner"
"1093",5832220,5835029,"I'm sure by now,you must all be very confused...","The Maze Runner"
"1094",5835560,5836590,"(a!!!)ff...","The Maze Runner"

"1099",5847899,5849609,"You won't remember...","The Maze Runner"
"1100",5849770,5852520,"but the Sun has scorched our world.","The Maze Runner"
"1101",5854340,5856850,"Billions of lives lost to fire...","The Maze Runner"
"1102",5857710,5858720,"famine...","The Maze Runner"

"1104",5862350,5865359,"The fallout was unimaginable.","The Maze Runner"
"1105",5866119,5868729,"What came after was worse.","The Maze Runner"
"1106",5869560,5871199,"We called it the Flare.","The Maze Runner"
"1107",5872229,5875680,"A deadly virus that attacks the brain.","The Maze Runner"

"1110",5880199,5882109,"incurable.","The Maze Runner"
"1111",5883369,5884939,"Or so we thought.","The Maze Runner"
"1112",5886609,5890850,"In time, a new generation emergedthat could survive the virus.","The Maze Runner"
"1113",5891010,5894520,"Suddenly, there was a reasonto hope for a cure.","The Maze Runner"
"1114",5895890,5898460,"But finding it would not be easy.","The Maze Runner"
"1115",5898619,5901729,"The young would have to be tested,even sacrificed...","The Maze Runner"
"1116",5902060,5904229,"inside harsh environments...","The Maze Runner"

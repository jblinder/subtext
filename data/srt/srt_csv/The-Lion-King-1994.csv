"136",559685,561395,"You must never go there, Simba.","The Lion King"
"137",561436,563438,"But I thought a kingcan do whatever he wants.","The Lion King"
"138",563480,565274,"There's more to being king...","The Lion King"
"139",565274,567067,"than getting your wayall the time.","The Lion King"
"140",567109,569278,"- There's more?- Simba...","The Lion King"

"145",581957,585127,"from the crawling antto the leaping antelope.","The Lion King"
"146",585169,587129,"But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?","The Lion King"
"147",587171,589756,"Yes, Simba, but let me explain.","The Lion King"
"148",589798,592676,"When we die,our bodies become the grass...","The Lion King"
"149",592718,595262,"and the antelope eat the grass.","The Lion King"

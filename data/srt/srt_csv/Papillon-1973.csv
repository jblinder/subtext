"109",670480,672720,"What if I could pick up the moneyto buy one?","Papillon"

"121",812060,813520,"What do you want?","Papillon"
"122",814600,815240,"Almost unbearable, isn't it?","Papillon"
"123",817520,818840,"What?","Papillon"
"124",819480,820000,"The heat.","Papillon"
"125",820960,822000,"It's not too bad.","Papillon"

"129",831640,833280,"May I tell you something?","Papillon"
"130",833680,836680,"At first glance I'm afraidthat I regarded you with rather...","Papillon"
"131",836800,840840,"...a large degree of unworthy suspicion.","Papillon"
"132",841480,842440,"Am I clear?","Papillon"
"133",842680,843560,"No.","Papillon"
"134",843680,848080,"Well, it now seems quite possiblethat until we get to a decent jail...","Papillon"
"135",848160,852520,"...with bribeable guards,I may stand in some need of...","Papillon"
"136",853480,855560,"...rather close physical protection.","Papillon"
"137",856960,859000,"It depends on how long you want to live.","Papillon"
"138",859200,861320,"Oh, a long time.","Papillon"
"139",862640,864640,"Then you got a problem.","Papillon"
"140",865520,868160,"Well, I presume that you have some...","Papillon"
"141",869040,870920,"...goals, some particular need that...","Papillon"
"142",871520,872840,"...outweighs all others.","Papillon"
"143",874240,876720,"I mean, if so, may I ask what it is?","Papillon"
"144",877080,878040,"Money.","Papillon"
"145",878480,879320,"For what?","Papillon"
"146",879600,880600,"Escape.","Papillon"
"147",881480,882480,"Very good.","Papillon"
"148",883560,885040,"You keep me alive...","Papillon"
"149",885560,890560,"...until we land in Guiana and I willunderwrite any escape you care to arrange.","Papillon"
"150",891480,893720,"Escape for me. Not for us.","Papillon"
"151",894360,896600,"Of course.","Papillon"
"152",897040,901560,"I have no intention of even attemptingan escape. Ever.","Papillon"

"159",1016880,1018800,"The other island is Royale.","Papillon"
"160",1019160,1020760,"The one on the right is Devil's.","Papillon"
"161",1021360,1025520,"Julot, why is it so hardto escape from there?","Papillon"
"162",1026880,1028980,"A man could almost swim to the mainland.","Papillon"
"163",1029160,1031900,"No, there must be a better waythan swimming.","Papillon"
"164",1032000,1033180,"No, no, swimming's not the way.","Papillon"
"165",1033560,1037520,"The current is so strong it'll push youright back where you started from.","Papillon"

"167",1045280,1046480,"Where do we go?","Papillon"
"168",1048720,1050360,"We go up the Moroni River.","Papillon"
"169",1050840,1052640,"Then we dock at Saint Laurent.","Papillon"
"170",1052720,1055840,"That's where they decide whetherto send you to the work camps or...","Papillon"
"171",1055880,1056960,"...to the islands.","Papillon"
"172",1095800,1097680,"You see those two on the dockwith the guns?","Papillon"
"173",1098040,1099160,"Right over there.","Papillon"

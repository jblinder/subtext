"1164",4458699,4460408,"and this little guy's drinking,","Fargo"
"1165",4460493,4462536,"and he says:""Where can a guy find some action?","Fargo"
"1166",4462620,4464871,"""I'm going crazy out there at the lake.""","Fargo"
"1167",4464956,4466414,"And I says:""What kind of action?""","Fargo"

"1169",4468793,4470373,"And I says:""Well, what do I look like?","Fargo"
"1170",4470436,4472462,"""I don't arrange that kind of thing.""","Fargo"
"1171",4472547,4475090,"And he says: ""But I'm goingcrazy out there at the lake.""","Fargo"
"1172",4475174,4478426,"And I says:""Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place.""","Fargo"
"1173",4478511,4481972,"He says: ""Oh, so I get it. So you thinkI'm some kind of jerk for asking.""","Fargo"
"1174",4482056,4483598,"Only he don't use the word ""jerk"".","Fargo"
"1175",4483683,4485267,"I understand.Then he calls me a jerk,","Fargo"
"1176",4485351,4487769,"says the last guy thoughthe's a jerk is dead now.","Fargo"
"1177",4487854,4489437,"So, I don't say nothing.","Fargo"
"1178",4489522,4491439,"He says:""What do you think about that?""","Fargo"
"1179",4491524,4494943,"And I says, ""Well, that don't soundlike too good a deal for him, then.""","Fargo"
"1180",4495027,4496069,"You got that right.","Fargo"
"1181",4496154,4497904,"Yeah, he says:""Yeah, that guy's dead,","Fargo"
"1182",4497989,4499447,"""and I don't mean of old age.""","Fargo"
"1183",4499532,4503076,"And then he says, ""Jeez, I'm goingcrazy out there at the lake.""","Fargo"
"1184",4503161,4504161,"White Bear Lake?","Fargo"
"1185",4504245,4506765,"Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,that's closer to Moose Lake.","Fargo"
"1186",4506789,4507956,"So I made that assumption.","Fargo"
"1187",4508040,4508999,"Sure.","Fargo"
"1188",4509083,4510876,"Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,","Fargo"
"1189",4510960,4512669,"so I don't think a whole great deal of it,","Fargo"
"1190",4512753,4515797,"but then Mrs. Mohra, she heardabout the homicides down here","Fargo"
"1191",4515882,4520010,"and thought I should callit in, so I called it in.","Fargo"
"1192",4522263,4523805,"End of story.","Fargo"

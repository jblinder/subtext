"694",2760424,2762341,"We probably drifted somewhaton account of the current.","Lifeboat"
"695",2762426,2765636,"We've been through all that. What'she doing in this part of the boat, anyway?","Lifeboat"
"696",2765721,2766888,"Why? Is he in quarantine?","Lifeboat"

"700",2776607,2778191,"He did save Gus's life, you know.","Lifeboat"
"701",2778317,2781027,"For the time being. After all,it was an emergency operation.","Lifeboat"
"702",2781153,2784363,"Don't you realize that it's imperative weget Gus to a hospital as soon as possible?","Lifeboat"
"703",2784490,2785490,"Sure, I do.","Lifeboat"

"706",2802382,2805510,"But that's not the point!The point is, are we headed for Bermuda?","Lifeboat"
"707",2805594,2808304,"What's come over the man?All you got to do is answer yes or no.","Lifeboat"
"708",2822820,2824403,"He admitswe're on the wrong course.","Lifeboat"

"725",2894182,2898311,"There's a little difference of opinionabout the direction we're headed.","Lifeboat"
"726",2898437,2900688,"Trouble is, I'm not sureabout our course.","Lifeboat"
"727",2902190,2904650,"I'm only sure of one thing...I don't trust that Nazi.","Lifeboat"
"728",2904735,2906777,"There must be other submarines aroundand he knows where they are,","Lifeboat"
"729",2906862,2908154,"or maybe a supply ship!","Lifeboat"
"730",2908614,2910281,"He knows where that is too.","Lifeboat"
"731",2910365,2913743,"On general principle, I'd copper anythinghe says. That's how I stand.","Lifeboat"
"732",2913827,2915620,"You agree with me, Sparks?","Lifeboat"
"733",2918749,2919832,"Well...","Lifeboat"

"742",2979601,2982645,"- What?- That's what you said yesterday.","Lifeboat"
"743",2982729,2986065,"That was a stupid thing to say!I didn't mean it, exactly.","Lifeboat"
"744",2986608,2988484,"What did you mean, exactly?","Lifeboat"
"745",2989069,2992530,"I only meantI was rather glad that we...","Lifeboat"
"746",2992614,2994824,"Well, I wasn't particularlyanxious to get to London.","Lifeboat"
"747",2994908,2997034,"What are you afraid ofin London?","Lifeboat"
"748",2997119,2998869,"Myself.","Lifeboat"
"749",2998954,3002373,"I mean, uh, it's a personal problem.In other words, I...","Lifeboat"

"754",3014344,3016804,"Fiddlesticks!","Lifeboat"
"755",3016930,3019432,"I don't want to pry intoyour personal affairs, darling,","Lifeboat"

"757",3022269,3026313,"You've been reading Kipling.""The sins ye do by two and two,","Lifeboat"

"759",3030986,3032903,"'Course I don't knowwho the guy is.","Lifeboat"
"760",3033697,3037783,"But I know men...especially married men!","Lifeboat"
"761",3039953,3042997,"Some of my best friends...","Lifeboat"
"762",3067773,3069690,"Don't let her upset you.","Lifeboat"
"763",3069816,3072109,"She certainly has a wayof getting at things.","Lifeboat"
"764",3072194,3073194,"That's right.","Lifeboat"
"765",3073320,3076781,"I didn't mind her prying, really.I wanted to talk.","Lifeboat"
"766",3076865,3080618,"Maybe that's why I'm all mixed up,because I've never told anybody.","Lifeboat"
"767",3082871,3086040,"I think I'd rather tell youthan anybody.","Lifeboat"
"768",3088168,3090252,"His name is Stephen.","Lifeboat"
"769",3091254,3092880,"He's a doctor.","Lifeboat"
"770",3093006,3095424,"We worked in the same hospital.","Lifeboat"
"771",3095509,3098135,"All the time,I knew he was married.","Lifeboat"
"772",3098220,3102056,"His wife's a fine woman,and they have two beautiful children.","Lifeboat"
"773",3103517,3107228,"So, you see, it was hopeless.It was quite hopeless.","Lifeboat"
"774",3107979,3110773,"Yes, of course! I... I see!","Lifeboat"
"775",3110857,3114276,"Well, we both decidedto forget about it.","Lifeboat"
"776",3114361,3118697,"And when he enlistedand was sent to London, I was glad.","Lifeboat"
"777",3119741,3121450,"I was really glad.","Lifeboat"
"778",3122285,3124787,"I tried to forget him,but I couldn't.","Lifeboat"
"779",3126414,3129542,"He wrote several times.I never answered.","Lifeboat"
"780",3130544,3133212,"And then when I was assignedto London myself...","Lifeboat"
"781",3134089,3138134,"Well, I knew if we met thereaway from home, away from every...","Lifeboat"
"782",3139845,3141178,"I'm sorry.","Lifeboat"
"783",3141721,3143389,"Maybe I better wait till I get home","Lifeboat"
"784",3143473,3146350,"and take it up with Mr Whositson the Goodwill Hour.","Lifeboat"
"785",3147519,3149603,"Sometimes that programme's funny.","Lifeboat"
"786",3151815,3153524,"Sometimes it isn't a bit.","Lifeboat"
"787",3154776,3158237,"When people are in trouble,they turn themselves inside-out.","Lifeboat"
"788",3159406,3161949,"Seem to feel better when theyget some sort of an answer.","Lifeboat"

"790",3167706,3169415,"Thank you, Stanley.","Lifeboat"
"791",3173336,3176714,"Lovely night we're having.Lots of stars out tonight.","Lifeboat"
"792",3181970,3186182,"I remember the night before we wastorpedoed. Nolan was... He was my first.","Lifeboat"
"793",3186266,3189101,"- Yes, I met him on the boat.- That's right. Yes.","Lifeboat"
"794",3189186,3193105,"He was telling me all about his wifegoing to stay with her family in Bermuda.","Lifeboat"
"795",3193231,3194940,"And how it's changedsince the war.","Lifeboat"
"796",3195859,3197401,"He told me that...","Lifeboat"
"797",3197944,3201447,"I remember as he pointed outour course over the bows,","Lifeboat"
"798",3201531,3204742,"I saw the planet Marslow on the horizon.","Lifeboat"
"799",3204826,3206827,"That's Mars over there,to the right.","Lifeboat"
"800",3209372,3211207,"And that's Venus.","Lifeboat"
"801",3214252,3216629,"We're headed for Venus.We're going East.","Lifeboat"
"802",3218924,3223302,"We're not heading for Bermuda.We're heading to miss Bermuda.","Lifeboat"
"803",3227224,3229141,"Well, we'll see about that.","Lifeboat"
"804",3241154,3244073,"After all,we did have to drag it out of...","Lifeboat"
"805",3244157,3246450,"That's part of the trick.He made suckers out of all of us.","Lifeboat"
"806",3246534,3249912,"Kovac, I still say we have no rightto condemn the man without a hearing.","Lifeboat"
"807",3249996,3252790,"Perhaps the course he gave us waswrong, but that doesn't prove anything.","Lifeboat"
"808",3252874,3254041,"He might have been mistaken.","Lifeboat"
"809",3254167,3257211,"When I questioned him yesterday,he didn't want to commit himself.","Lifeboat"
"810",3257337,3259046,"He said one couldn't be surewithout a compass.","Lifeboat"
"811",3259172,3260673,"The thing to do is to wake him upand question him.","Lifeboat"
"812",3260757,3264051,"We'll get nothing but lies.That's what he was brought up on.","Lifeboat"
"813",3264177,3267554,"And I was brought up under the idea thata man is innocent until he's proved guilty.","Lifeboat"
"814",3267681,3269473,"What do you want me to do?Appoint one of us to be his lawyer?","Lifeboat"
"815",3269557,3271684,"But don't you see,without a compass...","Lifeboat"
"816",3271810,3274645,"Mrs Porter, rememberyesterday you looked at your watch","Lifeboat"
"817",3274729,3276313,"and told the German the time?","Lifeboat"
"818",3276398,3278649,"- Yes!- Did he ask you the time?","Lifeboat"
"819",3278733,3279942,"Of course he did.","Lifeboat"
"820",3280026,3282361,"- That's funny.- What's funny about it?","Lifeboat"
"821",3282445,3284530,"- He had a watch of his own.- Well, what of it?","Lifeboat"
"822",3284614,3287741,"If he had a watch, why would hehave to ask Mrs Porter for the time?","Lifeboat"
"823",3287867,3289159,"That doesn't prove anything.","Lifeboat"
"824",3289244,3292538,"Lots of times I have my own watchin my pocket and I ask somebody the time.","Lifeboat"
"825",3292622,3296083,"Lots of people do that! It just, uh...It just saves time, that's all.","Lifeboat"
"826",3296209,3299086,"But he looked at his own watchjust before he asked Mrs Porter.","Lifeboat"
"827",3299212,3301505,"Perhaps his own watch stopped.","Lifeboat"
"828",3301589,3304717,"I remember when he asked for the time,he took a squint at the sun.","Lifeboat"
"829",3304843,3307052,"What are you trying to do, convict a manbecause he looks at the sun?","Lifeboat"
"830",3307137,3309888,"- Is it a crime to ask for the time?- Certainly not.","Lifeboat"
"831",3309973,3313600,"- What time is it?- Ten past 7:00.","Lifeboat"
"832",3313727,3316687,"- I think you're slow.- Slow? That's a Philippe Patek.","Lifeboat"
"833",3316771,3318689,"I wanna know what time it isby the German's watch.","Lifeboat"
"834",3318773,3320482,"Well, why don't youwake him up and ask him?","Lifeboat"
"835",3320984,3323152,"Don't have to wake him up.Not with Joe around.","Lifeboat"
"836",3323695,3324695,"- Joe.- Yeah?","Lifeboat"
"837",3324779,3326447,"- Operate.- Huh?","Lifeboat"
"838",3326573,3328073,"Do your stuff.","Lifeboat"
"839",3328158,3329950,"What stuff?I don't know what you mean.","Lifeboat"
"840",3330076,3331910,"Frisk him for his turnip.","Lifeboat"
"841",3331995,3335497,"- I cut that stuff out a long time ago.- But this is an emergency.","Lifeboat"
"842",3335582,3337833,"- The folks'll understand.- Understand what?","Lifeboat"
"843",3337917,3339418,"Joe used to be one of the bestall-around...","Lifeboat"
"844",3339544,3341295,"Now, wait a minute, Gus!","Lifeboat"
"845",3341421,3343130,"You ain't got no rightbringin' up what used to be.","Lifeboat"
"846",3343256,3345758,"That's all right, Joe.Some of my best friends are...","Lifeboat"
"847",3345842,3349345,"I know, but I madea pledge, a solemn pledge.","Lifeboat"
"848",3349429,3350846,"Do you wanna commit mutiny?","Lifeboat"
"849",3352766,3354641,"- Is it an order?- It's an order.","Lifeboat"
"850",3357020,3358645,"Oh, I can't.The guy's asleep.","Lifeboat"
"851",3358772,3359980,"That's a break, isn't it?","Lifeboat"
"852",3360106,3362608,"Yeah, but it's like...It's like shootin' a sittin' duck!","Lifeboat"
"853",3362692,3366070,"Quit stalling! If your conscience bothersyou, wake him up! Only, get the ticker!","Lifeboat"
"854",3371910,3374119,"Kovac!","Lifeboat"
"855",3375372,3376955,"Looks like quite a blow.","Lifeboat"
"856",3380293,3382044,"Pardon me!I'm... sorry!","Lifeboat"

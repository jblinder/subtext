"1071",5419970,5421086,"I'm sorry.","World War Z"

"1074",5426291,5428360,"What do you need from us?","World War Z"
"1075",5429171,5430762,"Your worst disease.","World War Z"
"1076",5435051,5436369,"He wants a what?","World War Z"
"1077",5436490,5437970,"Deadly pathogen.","World War Z"
"1078",5438490,5440243,"With a high mortality rate.","World War Z"
"1079",5440970,5443404,"- But curable.- Okay, well...","World War Z"
"1080",5443490,5445845,"You'd want a bacteriarather than a virus,","World War Z"
"1081",5445930,5447204,"I would think. Typhus?","World War Z"
"1082",5447970,5449484,"Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.","World War Z"
"1083",5449570,5450720,"Rocky Mountain Fever.","World War Z"
"1084",5451331,5453640,"Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?","World War Z"
"1085",5453930,5457765,"Mr. Lane believes we can usesuch a disease against the undead.","World War Z"
"1086",5458011,5461480,"I would give you pointsfor originality, Mr. Lane,","World War Z"
"1087",5461570,5463481,"if we hadn't already tried that,first thing.","World War Z"
"1088",5463610,5469322,"One of the many things a virus orbacteria needs to thrive is a live host.","World War Z"
"1089",5469451,5470884,"A functioning circulatory system.","World War Z"
"1090",5471011,5473127,"I'm afraid it boils downto one simple fact...","World War Z"
"1091",5473211,5474882,"You can't make a dead person sick.","World War Z"
"1092",5476371,5477884,"It's not for them.","World War Z"
"1093",5478650,5480130,"It's for us.","World War Z"
"1094",5481850,5484239,"I believe these thingshave a weakness.","World War Z"
"1095",5484970,5486881,"And that weakness is weakness.","World War Z"
"1096",5487411,5489048,"Our weakness.","World War Z"
"1097",5489131,5491520,"I have witnessed themliterally bypass people.","World War Z"
"1098",5491690,5494363,"Walk right around them likea river around a rock. Why?","World War Z"
"1099",5495211,5497485,"I think, because thosepeople were sick.","World War Z"
"1100",5498051,5499369,"I think they were terminal.","World War Z"
"1101",5499451,5500850,"And these things could sense it.","World War Z"
"1102",5501211,5503280,"I think they're spreading a pathogen,","World War Z"
"1103",5503371,5505088,"and they need a healthy host.","World War Z"
"1104",5505331,5507447,"But even if you're right, I mean,infecting the populace","World War Z"
"1105",5507530,5509725,"with a lethal illness isnot exactly a cure.","World War Z"
"1106",5510211,5512679,"It's not a cure. It's camouflage.","World War Z"
"1107",5516291,5517644,"It's camouflage.","World War Z"
"1108",5522171,5524047,"There's a natural precedent.","World War Z"
"1109",5524251,5527765,"Hungry predatorswill avoid diseased bodies.","World War Z"
"1110",5528211,5530805,"Equipped with the right pathogen,our troops","World War Z"
"1111",5530890,5533166,"would be essentiallyinvisible to the enemy.","World War Z"
"1112",5534251,5537243,"You understand the only wayto prove this theory of yours is","World War Z"
"1113",5537770,5539170,"for some idiot to infect themselves","World War Z"
"1114",5539251,5541127,"with a lethal pathogen and then...","World War Z"
"1115",5542371,5545248,"...meet with her, face to face.","World War Z"
"1116",5548570,5549685,"Yes.","World War Z"
"1117",5550371,5552440,"Do we have what we need to try it?","World War Z"
"1118",5552530,5553759,"We have all he could want.","World War Z"
"1119",5554490,5557085,"Typhus, H1 N1, SARS.","World War Z"
"1120",5557730,5559368,"The problem is,","World War Z"
"1121",5559451,5561487,"they're all stored in B-Wing.","World War Z"
"1122",5562451,5564168,"What's the matter with B-Wing?","World War Z"
"1123",5565690,5568762,"Dr. Spellman.Our chief vaccinologist.","World War Z"
"1124",5570131,5572884,"Within hours of the outbreak,he'd been sent blood samples","World War Z"
"1125",5572970,5575166,"to try and isolate thepathogenic cause.","World War Z"
"1126",5579051,5580529,"Unfortunately...","World War Z"
"1127",5585091,5586409,"This is B-Wing now.","World War Z"
"1128",5593371,5595167,"God damn it.","World War Z"
"1129",5599411,5600685,"How many?","World War Z"
"1130",5601570,5602720,"How many are there?","World War Z"
"1131",5602810,5604641,"There were 80 people working there.","World War Z"
"1132",5609331,5611127,"I've never seen them move like that.","World War Z"
"1133",5611211,5612484,"They're dormant.","World War Z"
"1134",5612970,5614962,"They're awaiting stimulus.","World War Z"
"1135",5616091,5617159,"Now, this","World War Z"
"1136",5618211,5619644,"is vault 139.","World War Z"
"1137",5620211,5622007,"That's where your samples would be.","World War Z"
"1138",5623251,5625605,"This is the skybridge.","World War Z"
"1139",5626850,5629206,"That connects B-Wingto the main building here.","World War Z"
"1140",5630171,5634448,"And this, is the only thing standingbetween us and the skybridge.","World War Z"
"1141",5634610,5635680,"So,","World War Z"

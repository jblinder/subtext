"879",2357000,2359000,"I'm much less interestedin ''the usual stuff''","Couples Retreat"

"889",2384199,2387099,"Why do you keepwriting stuff down
on your little pad there?","Couples Retreat"
"890",2387199,2389099,"Oh, I'm taking notes.","Couples Retreat"

more comfortable.","Couples Retreat"
"893",2396099,2397099,"Thank you.","Couples Retreat"
"894",2397099,2399000,"That's interesting.","Couples Retreat"

"901",2413199,2415000,"Everything but a mix tape.","Couples Retreat"
"902",2416199,2418199,"How would youcharacterize
your marriage?","Couples Retreat"
"903",2420000,2421099,"Perfect.","Couples Retreat"

"914",2446199,2450099,"And we had...We actually had
our daughter... We...","Couples Retreat"
"915",2451199,2454199,"On prom night,we conceived Lacy","Couples Retreat"
"916",2455000,2457099,"and it was a littleconfusing at the time,
but it's been a blessing.","Couples Retreat"
"917",2457099,2458199,"It's been the best thingthat's ever happened to us.","Couples Retreat"
"918",2459000,2460000,"It's been the best thingthat ever happened to us.","Couples Retreat"
"919",2460099,2461199,"We did the right thing.","Couples Retreat"
"920",2461199,2463099,"How often do you have sex?","Couples Retreat"
"921",2465099,2469099,"She wants me to betougher, screw harder.","Couples Retreat"

"926",2481199,2482199,"Then why are you here?","Couples Retreat"
"927",2483099,2486099,"This is not my wife.This is Trudy.
I met her a couple weeks ago.","Couples Retreat"
"928",2486099,2487199,"Can we goboogie boarding now?","Couples Retreat"
"929",2489099,2491199,"And once people knewwhat we were going through,","Couples Retreat"
"930",2491199,2495199,"I think my cortical levelsjust shot up through the roof.","Couples Retreat"
"931",2496199,2498199,"Because it's difficultto go through","Couples Retreat"
"932",2499000,2501000,"a very privatestruggle publicly.","Couples Retreat"
"933",2504099,2505199,"I heard what you think,","Couples Retreat"
"934",2506000,2507099,"but you know whatI'm really interested in","Couples Retreat"

"936",2511000,2513099,"Just tell her how you feel.","Couples Retreat"
"937",2513099,2514199,"Well, I thinkif you looked at
everything that...","Couples Retreat"
"938",2514199,2518000,"No, no, no, no.Just... Don't explain
intellectually how you feel.","Couples Retreat"
"939",2518099,2521099,"You know, just tell herhow you feel. In one word.","Couples Retreat"
"940",2522000,2523000,"Sure.","Couples Retreat"

"954",2549099,2550199,"I mean,are we going to make it?","Couples Retreat"
"955",2550199,2553000,"Well, you know, it's justour first session, you know.","Couples Retreat"
"956",2553000,2555199,"We're not lookingfor an end result here.
It's not a competition.","Couples Retreat"
"957",2555199,2558199,"I get all that,but have you seen couples
that are worse off than us?","Couples Retreat"
"958",2558199,2560099,"Yeah.Or are we that far gone?","Couples Retreat"
"959",2560099,2562099,"We're...Are you going to put a...
Like a numerical value on it?","Couples Retreat"
"960",2562099,2564000,"You know, Doc?Like a one to 10?","Couples Retreat"
"961",2564000,2565099,"One being worst,10 being best?","Couples Retreat"
"962",2565099,2567099,"No, hang on one second.Where would you put us?","Couples Retreat"
"963",2567099,2569099,"Right where you are, sir.","Couples Retreat"
"964",2569099,2571000,"What if someone puta gun to your head
right now and said,","Couples Retreat"
"965",2571099,2573000,"''You have toanswer this second
or I'II shoot.","Couples Retreat"
"966",2573099,2575000,"""Are they going to make it?''What do you say?","Couples Retreat"
"967",2575000,2576000,"What would you say?","Couples Retreat"
"968",2576000,2579099,"Whoa! Okay, no one has a gunto my head, Mr. Smith.","Couples Retreat"
"969",2579099,2580099,"It's hypothetical.","Couples Retreat"
"970",2580099,2582099,"It's not a place forinappropriate behaviour.","Couples Retreat"
"971",2582099,2585099,"And you definitely don'tpull a hypothetical gun
on your therapist.","Couples Retreat"
"972",2585099,2586099,"Sorry.","Couples Retreat"
"973",2586099,2587099,"It's okay.","Couples Retreat"
"974",2587199,2589000,"Let's clear the karma. Okay?","Couples Retreat"
"975",2589000,2590199,"Iﾂ値l holster this.","Couples Retreat"
"976",2591000,2592099,"See, you know,I work 10 hours a day,","Couples Retreat"
"977",2592199,2594000,"so by the time I come home,I'm exhausted.","Couples Retreat"
"978",2594000,2596199,"It's not that I don'twant to answer questions
about the house renovation.","Couples Retreat"
"979",2596199,2599000,"I really just don'twant to answer questions
about anything.","Couples Retreat"
"980",2599099,2602000,"But, you know,you may just be
shutting your mind off,","Couples Retreat"
"981",2602000,2605099,"but it can feellike you're shutting
your partner off as well.","Couples Retreat"
"982",2605199,2607099,"Again, that's a caution area.","Couples Retreat"
"983",2607099,2608199,"And justas a point of interest,","Couples Retreat"
"984",2609000,2610099,"when you speakthat way, David,","Couples Retreat"
"985",2610199,2613099,"you're really de-prioritizingyour teammate.","Couples Retreat"
"986",2613199,2614199,"Excuse me?","Couples Retreat"
"987",2614199,2617000,"It's called ''crossingemotional boundaries.''","Couples Retreat"
"988",2617000,2621099,"Or, more commonly,''bulldozing.'' And it's ugly.","Couples Retreat"
"989",2622199,2624199,"Ronnie, when youspoke earlier of...","Couples Retreat"
"990",2624199,2627000,"Let me just find itin my notes here.","Couples Retreat"
"991",2627199,2629099,"","Couples Retreat"
"992",2634000,2638000,"There it is. You said,""We make it through
things well together.''","Couples Retreat"
"993",2638099,2640000,"That doesn't sound very fun.","Couples Retreat"
"994",2640000,2643199,"You don't want tolook back and say,
''I made it through my life.''","Couples Retreat"
"995",2643199,2647000,"We want to enjoy our projects,enjoy our work week.","Couples Retreat"
"996",2647099,2650000,"We want to enjoy our lives,celebrate our lives.","Couples Retreat"
"997",2650099,2652000,"And all this talkabout my project","Couples Retreat"
"998",2652000,2654099,"and his work,and my this and his that,","Couples Retreat"
"999",2654199,2657099,"and mine and his,and mine and... It's...","Couples Retreat"
"1000",2657099,2659199,"Where's us in all that?","Couples Retreat"
"1001",2659199,2662199,"Where is our journey?I don't hear it.","Couples Retreat"
"1002",2662199,2664199,"And it's becauseit's not there.","Couples Retreat"
"1003",2665099,2667099,"Listen. I'm not sayingthat there's not","Couples Retreat"
"1004",2667099,2669099,"some reallystressful times sometimes,","Couples Retreat"
"1005",2669099,2671099,"because there is,but it works for us.","Couples Retreat"
"1006",2671099,2672199,"Does it?","Couples Retreat"
"1007",2674099,2675199,"I don't know.","Couples Retreat"
"1008",2677099,2679199,"Oh, gosh,I don't know, you guys.","Couples Retreat"
"1009",2680099,2682199,"There's no ''us.''There's no ''we.''","Couples Retreat"
"1010",2682199,2685000,"You two could beperfect strangers.","Couples Retreat"
"1011",2686000,2689199,"I think the one thingthat we can agree on, today,","Couples Retreat"
"1012",2690199,2695099,"is that you guys should bedoing a lot better
than just ""works.""","Couples Retreat"
"1013",2697000,2699099,"Pretty surethat's why you're here.","Couples Retreat"
"1014",2700000,2704000,"Oh. That's it. Great.Great job, everybody.

become more like a job.","Couples Retreat"
"1059",2915199,2916199,"How do you mean?","Couples Retreat"
"1060",2917000,2919199,"For example,he says that Dave
is de-prioritizing me,","Couples Retreat"
"1061",2920000,2923099,"that he doesn'tpay attention to
what I actually want.","Couples Retreat"
"1062",2923099,2926099,"Yeah, but, honey,that's just Dave

"477",1880546,1882386,"Why do we judge the Kaijuon a category system?","Pacific Rim"
"478",1884182,1886482,"It's because each one is completelydifferent from the next, right?","Pacific Rim"
"479",1886484,1888384,"You see what I'm saying? One looks likea shark and one looks like a fish..","Pacific Rim"
"480",1888386,1890554,"Dr. Geiszler.Just get to the point.","Pacific Rim"
"481",1890556,1892489,"Yes.The point is I don't think","Pacific Rim"
"482",1892490,1894023,"They're all completely differentafter all.","Pacific Rim"
"483",1894026,1895893,"These are some samplesI collected, all right?","Pacific Rim"
"484",1895894,1899096,"Now, this one herewas harvested in Sydney.","Pacific Rim"
"485",1899097,1901698,"And this was harvestedin manila.","Pacific Rim"
"486",1901700,1902932,"6 years ago.","Pacific Rim"
"487",1902934,1906769,"They have the same exact DNA.","Pacific Rim"
"488",1906771,1910007,"They're clones.","Pacific Rim"
"489",1910009,1914010,"And this is the point wherehe goes completely crazy.","Pacific Rim"
"490",1914012,1917213,"There's so much more tothe Kaiju than we understand.","Pacific Rim"
"491",1917215,1919950,"And we've really onlyscratched the surface.","Pacific Rim"
"492",1919951,1922251,"This is a pieceof a Kaiju's brain.","Pacific Rim"
"493",1922253,1924421,"Now, unfortunately,it's damaged.","Pacific Rim"
"494",1924423,1927223,"It's a little bit weak.But it's still alive.","Pacific Rim"
"495",1927226,1928791,"Now, I think I can tap into it","Pacific Rim"
"496",1928794,1930426,"Using the same technology","Pacific Rim"
"497",1930429,1932729,"That allows the two Jaegerpilots to share a neural bridge.","Pacific Rim"
"498",1932730,1934463,"Now, think about that.","Pacific Rim"
"499",1934465,1936599,"I could tell you exactly","Pacific Rim"
"500",1936602,1938367,"How to get throughthe breach yourselves.","Pacific Rim"
"501",1938369,1940971,"You're suggesting that weinitiate a drift with a Kaiju?","Pacific Rim"
"502",1940972,1943140,"No, no. No, no. Not likea whole Kaiju, you know,","Pacific Rim"
"503",1943142,1944907,"Just a tiny piece of its brain.","Pacific Rim"
"504",1944910,1947076,"The neural surge would betoo much for the human brain.","Pacific Rim"
"505",1947078,1949546,"I agree. I don't agree.","Pacific Rim"

"511",1961259,1963961,"So you've not wasted your lifebeing a Kaiju groupie,","Pacific Rim"
"512",1963962,1965561,"But it's not going to work.","Pacific Rim"
"513",1965564,1967096,"It is going to work, Hermann.","Pacific Rim"

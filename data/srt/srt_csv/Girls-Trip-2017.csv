"673",3375972,3379339,"Gentlemen, I certainly appreciateyour confidence in me.","Girls Trip"
"674",3379409,3382606,"But I'm afraid a position like thatisn't quite in my line.","Girls Trip"
"675",3382679,3384237,"You're asking me to turn policeman.","Girls Trip"
"676",3384314,3388148,"I have about as much qualificationsfor that as I have teaching the ballet.","Girls Trip"
"677",3388218,3390982,"You seemed to be well-qualifiedthe other day in the plaza.","Girls Trip"
"678",3391054,3393522,"I had to get that big hardheadout of that somehow.","Girls Trip"

"684",3412208,3414574,"I can certainly appreciateeverything you say.","Girls Trip"
"685",3414644,3416942,"But as far as I'm concerned,it can't be done.","Girls Trip"
"686",3417013,3420176,"I'm in the cattle business.That demands all my time and attention.","Girls Trip"
"687",3420250,3421308,"I'm sorry.","Girls Trip"

"692",3432128,3434460,"Your struggle to make a livingin a decent city?","Girls Trip"
"693",3434531,3437432,"What Dodge City needs is a manwith a sense of public pride...","Girls Trip"

"695",3441070,3444403,"But Mr. Hatton's bravery consistsof gunfights with impulsive boys.","Girls Trip"
"696",3444474,3445998,"Abbie, stop it.","Girls Trip"
"697",3451147,3454605,"Well, gentlemen,I don't think much remains to be said.","Girls Trip"

"728",3731894,3734124,"I wanted to be sureyou'd seen this, Surrett.","Girls Trip"
"729",3734197,3736097,"So I paid you a special visit.","Girls Trip"
"730",3736165,3737689,"I've already seen it.","Girls Trip"
"731",3737767,3740736,"It looks like you're tryingto run everybody out of Dodge City.","Girls Trip"
"732",3740803,3743897,"No, not everybody.Just the undesirable element.","Girls Trip"
"733",3744674,3748007,"There's no law in Kansasthat prevents a man from carrying a gun...","Girls Trip"
"734",3748077,3751638,"- or coming or going where he pleases.- There's going to be one.","Girls Trip"
"735",3751914,3753541,"Sit down, Hatton.","Girls Trip"
"736",3755017,3756917,"The merchantsare not gonna stand for this.","Girls Trip"
"737",3756986,3760012,"Yes, I think they will. The merchantshelped me draw this law up.","Girls Trip"
"738",3760089,3761818,"They're willing to take their chances.","Girls Trip"
"739",3761891,3764018,"I just wanted to be certainabout you, though.","Girls Trip"
"740",3764093,3766857,"- Let's get down to cases, Hatton.- Right.","Girls Trip"
"741",3768397,3769796,"What cases?","Girls Trip"
"742",3770032,3771795,"You and I have had a couple of run-ins.","Girls Trip"
"743",3771868,3774996,"But I'll forget them if you do,and see if we can't work together.","Girls Trip"
"744",3775071,3777471,"If you really mean that,that'll make my job easier.","Girls Trip"
"745",3777540,3780168,"- Your job is just what you make it.- So I hear.","Girls Trip"
"746",3780243,3782734,"The last few sheriffs heredidn't do so well, did they?","Girls Trip"
"747",3782812,3785906,"They weren't your type. Just a bunchof dumb sheep wearing badges.","Girls Trip"
"748",3785982,3787745,"I never even bothered to talk to them.","Girls Trip"
"749",3787817,3790377,"I'll bet if you had,you'd have told them a thing or two.","Girls Trip"
"750",3790453,3792819,"Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway.","Girls Trip"
"751",3792889,3794288,"Now listen, Hatton.","Girls Trip"
"752",3794357,3797190,"There's no reasonthat Dodge City can't be run properly.","Girls Trip"
"753",3797260,3799820,"Just so long as you don't tryto change things too much.","Girls Trip"
"754",3799896,3802456,"Because this is a cattle town,the biggest one on earth.","Girls Trip"
"755",3802532,3804193,"And that's what it's always gonna be.","Girls Trip"
"756",3804267,3806758,"There's more than $20 million worthof beef and hides...","Girls Trip"
"757",3806836,3808269,"comes through here every year.","Girls Trip"
"758",3808337,3810328,"You know that because you bring them up.","Girls Trip"
"759",3810406,3812465,"You've been holdingthe wrong end of the sack...","Girls Trip"
"760",3812542,3815511,"because the real moneyain't working for those Texas breeders.","Girls Trip"
"761",3815578,3819070,"No, sir. It's right here in Dodge Citybecause this is where they pay off.","Girls Trip"
"762",3819148,3820638,"You mean, on your roulette tables.","Girls Trip"
"763",3820716,3822308,"Sure, coming and going.","Girls Trip"
"764",3822385,3825445,"If not for the Gay Lady,that money would go out of Dodge City...","Girls Trip"
"765",3825521,3828319,"and the trade would move right onto Wichita.","Girls Trip"
"766",3828391,3829949,"You know that cattle crowd.","Girls Trip"
"767",3830026,3832756,"After months of backbreaking workgetting the cattle here...","Girls Trip"
"768",3832829,3834694,"they want a little fun and freedom.","Girls Trip"
"769",3834764,3837062,"If it's not here,they'll go where they can get it.","Girls Trip"
"770",3837133,3839966,"- And you'd go broke.- Sure. But I ain't aiming to.","Girls Trip"
"771",3841103,3844300,"You see, I make $100,000 a yearone way or another.","Girls Trip"
"772",3844373,3846466,"Frankly, I don't need that much money.","Girls Trip"
"773",3846542,3849033,"Naturally, I'd be willing to make a dealwith anybody...","Girls Trip"
"774",3849111,3851705,"that would sort of see things my way.","Girls Trip"
"775",3852515,3854915,"Make a mighty good deal for both of us.","Girls Trip"
"776",3854984,3857248,"You mean, a little friendly bribery?","Girls Trip"
"777",3857320,3861222,"You can catch more flies with molassesthan you can with vinegar.","Girls Trip"
"778",3861290,3864555,"True enough.I hope you'll not be offended...","Girls Trip"
"779",3864894,3867727,"but I don't like the smell of your molasses.","Girls Trip"
"780",3875238,3878799,"You'd better get rid of that gunby Monday. You're north of Front Street...","Girls Trip"
"781",3878875,3881639,"and that jail's apt to be a little crowded.","Girls Trip"
"782",3885915,3888213,"What's the matter? Didn't it work?","Girls Trip"
"783",3889085,3891212,"He wouldn't listen to reason?","Girls Trip"
"784",3891721,3892915,"No, he wouldn't.","Girls Trip"
"785",3896559,3899187,"All right, Russ, let's go. We've a lot to do.","Girls Trip"
"786",3903065,3905499,"Don't ever do nothing like thatunless I tell you to.","Girls Trip"
"787",3905568,3908093,"This ain't the time. We gotta wait a while.","Girls Trip"
"788",3909505,3912235,"They sure make a fella feel at homearound here.","Girls Trip"
"789",3912308,3915436,"Yes. They'll even dig you a home,if you're nice to them.","Girls Trip"
"790",3919148,3921275,"One at a time here, fellas. Line up.","Girls Trip"
"791",3921350,3922612,"There you are.","Girls Trip"

"798",3943205,3946299,"- I guess we better quit, boys.- Quitting because you're winning?","Girls Trip"
"799",3946375,3949242,"- You read that sign, didn't you?- We don't believe in signs.","Girls Trip"
"800",3949312,3953646,"That sheriff's a big four-flusher andthat sign's been bad luck to me all night.","Girls Trip"
"801",3956052,3958885,"Guess that'll show youHatton ain't bluffing.","Girls Trip"
"802",3959021,3961922,"That's right, gentlemen.Hatton's not bluffing.","Girls Trip"
"803",3961991,3963856,"- You're all under arrest.- For what?","Girls Trip"
"804",3963926,3966690,"For not believing in signs.All right, deputies, take them.","Girls Trip"
"805",3966762,3969287,"- Come on.- Let go, now.","Girls Trip"
"806",3971067,3975094,"I tried to warn them, but I guessthey gotta learn through experience.","Girls Trip"
"807",3975171,3977196,"I don't know whatyou're warning people about.","Girls Trip"
"808",3977273,3980674,"- What do you mean?- You're north of Front Street, aren't you?","Girls Trip"
"809",3980743,3983041,"- And you're carrying a gun, aren't you?- Yeah.","Girls Trip"

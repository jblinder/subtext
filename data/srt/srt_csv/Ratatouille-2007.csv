"110",388254,389221,"Yeah.","Ratatouille"

"1121",4921622,4924557,"You know, I've neverdisappointed anyone before,","Ratatouille"
"1122",4924658,4927457,"because nobody'sever expected anything of me.","Ratatouille"
"1123",4927561,4930326,"And the only reasonanyone expects anything from me now","Ratatouille"
"1124",4930431,4932592,"is because of you.","Ratatouille"

"1155",5054756,5056780,"Something from our menu.","Ratatouille"

"1161",5071471,5074532,"The key, my friend, is to not be picky.","Ratatouille"
"1162",5074908,5076967,"- Observe.- No, wait!","Ratatouille"
"1163",5078613,5082480,"- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?- I'll go get Dad.","Ratatouille"
"1164",5085052,5091322,"You might think you are a chefbut you are still only a rat.","Ratatouille"
"1165",5091725,5094957,"Sure he took away a starlast time he reviewed this place.","Ratatouille"
"1166",5095063,5097462,"Sure it probably killed... Dad.","Ratatouille"
"1167",5097765,5101530,"- This is very bad juju right here.- But I'll tell you one thing...","Ratatouille"

"1177",5143543,5145068,"Yes, I think I do.","Ratatouille"

"1244",5368402,5370596,"the truth.","Ratatouille"
"1245",5371305,5375537,"And the truth is, I have no talent at all.","Ratatouille"
"1246",5376310,5380212,"But this rat,he's the one behind these recipes.","Ratatouille"
"1247",5380314,5385411,"He's the cook. The real cook.He's been hiding under my toque.","Ratatouille"
"1248",5385752,5387686,"He's been controlling my actions.","Ratatouille"
"1249",5389756,5393318,"He's the reason I can cook the foodthat's exciting everyone.","Ratatouille"
"1250",5393528,5396622,"The reason Ego is outside that door.","Ratatouille"
"1251",5396863,5399662,"You've been giving me creditfor his gift.","Ratatouille"
"1252",5399934,5401525,"I know it's a hard thing to believe.","Ratatouille"

"1293",5735435,5737301,"What? I am making ratatouille.","Ratatouille"
"1294",5738471,5740939,"Well, how would you prepare it?","Ratatouille"
"1295",5772972,5776136,"Ratatouille? They must be joking.","Ratatouille"
"1296",5822221,5823484,"Mmm.","Ratatouille"
"1297",5827027,5828789,"No, it can't be.","Ratatouille"
"1298",5829395,5833024,"Who cooked the ratatouille?I demand to know!","Ratatouille"
"1299",5840039,5841667,"I can't remember the last time","Ratatouille"
"1300",5841774,5845073,"I asked a waiterto give my compliments to the chef.","Ratatouille"
"1301",5846046,5848844,"And now I find myselfin the extraordinary position","Ratatouille"
"1302",5848948,5851042,"of having my waiter be the chef.","Ratatouille"
"1303",5851251,5854185,"Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.","Ratatouille"
"1304",5855255,5857722,"Then who do I thank for the meal?","Ratatouille"
"1305",5858591,5860287,"Excuse me a minute.","Ratatouille"
"1306",5871305,5872293,"You must be the chef...","Ratatouille"
"1307",5872405,5874533,"If you wish to meet the chef,you will have to wait","Ratatouille"
"1308",5874640,5876699,"until all the other customer have gone.","Ratatouille"
"1309",5878746,5879905,"So be it.","Ratatouille"
"1310",5901601,5904127,"At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.","Ratatouille"
"1311",5904337,5910277,"But as Linguini explains,Ego's smile disappears.","Ratatouille"
"1312",5915882,5919944,"He doesn't reactbeyond asking an occasional question.","Ratatouille"
"1313",5920487,5924855,"And when the story is done,Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...","Ratatouille"
"1314",5924957,5926618,"Thank you for the meal.","Ratatouille"
"1315",5926726,5929594,"...and leaves without another word.","Ratatouille"
"1316",5931864,5935801,"The following day his review appears.","Ratatouille"
"1317",5938337,5942434,"In many ways,the work of a critic is easy.","Ratatouille"
"1318",5942643,5946875,"We risk very little,yet enjoy a position over those","Ratatouille"
"1319",5946979,5951041,"who offer up their workand their selves to our judgment.","Ratatouille"
"1320",5951284,5956654,"We thrive on negative criticism,which is fun to write and to read.","Ratatouille"
"1321",5957190,5963720,"But the bitter truth we critics must faceis that in the grand scheme of things,","Ratatouille"
"1322",5963831,5967823,"the average piece of junkis probably more meaningful","Ratatouille"
"1323",5967935,5971199,"than our criticism designating it so.","Ratatouille"
"1324",5971572,5975702,"But there are timeswhen a critic truly risks something","Ratatouille"
"1325",5975809,5980109,"and that is in the discoveryand defense of the new.","Ratatouille"
"1326",5980213,5984810,"The world is often unkindto new talent, new creations.","Ratatouille"
"1327",5985018,5987485,"The new needs friends.","Ratatouille"
"1328",5987787,5991314,"Last night,I experienced something new,","Ratatouille"
"1329",5991524,5996484,"an extraordinary mealfrom a singularly unexpected source.","Ratatouille"
"1330",5996697,5999324,"To say that both the mealand its maker","Ratatouille"
"1331",5999432,6002925,"have challenged my preconceptionsabout fine cooking","Ratatouille"
"1332",6003036,6005731,"is a gross understatement.","Ratatouille"

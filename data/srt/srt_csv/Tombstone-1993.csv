"425",2795050,2798704,"...in his early thirties and had fair hair.","Tombstone"
"426",2799034,2800871,"Surely a better description can be found.","Tombstone"

"431",2817273,2821603,"Commissioner Berthier,any suggestions?","Tombstone"
"432",2821702,2823527,"We're in trouble on this one.","Tombstone"
"433",2823626,2825927,"Our agents inside the OAScan't pin him down...","Tombstone"

"436",2831786,2833608,"Territorial surveillance can'tpick him up at the border...","Tombstone"
"437",2833708,2835682,"...because they don't knowwhat he looks like.","Tombstone"
"438",2835782,2838567,"The gendarmes, all 48,000 of them,can't pursue him.","Tombstone"

"441",2845369,2848322,"Without a name, all otherproposals are meaningless.","Tombstone"
"442",2848422,2850338,"The first task then is to find it.","Tombstone"
"443",2850438,2854182,"With a name,we get a passport and a face.","Tombstone"
"444",2854282,2856804,"With a face,we get an arrest.","Tombstone"
"445",2856903,2860324,"But to find his name,and to do it in secret...","Tombstone"
"446",2860423,2862565,"...is a job of pure detective work.","Tombstone"

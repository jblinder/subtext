"109",523820,526823,"He had a good employment record,good references.","The Shining"
"110",527073,529283,"And from what I've been told,he seemed. . .","The Shining"
"111",529534,532162,". . .like a completelynormal individual.","The Shining"
"112",532456,534750,"But at some pointduring the winter. . .","The Shining"
"113",535000,538629,". . .he must have suffered some kindof a complete mental breakdown.","The Shining"

"192",896009,896998,"But you should've seen him.","The Shining"
"193",897677,898701,"I know.","The Shining"
"194",898913,900607,"Kids can scare you to death.","The Shining"
"195",900816,903682,"But believe me, these episodesare not at all uncommon.","The Shining"
"196",903885,906447,"And they look much worsethan they are.","The Shining"
"197",906990,909652,"But what was the matter with him?","The Shining"
"198",909859,913955,"Most of the time, these episodeswith kids are never explained.","The Shining"
"199",914164,919033,"They're brought on by emotionalfactors and rarely occur again.","The Shining"
"200",919836,922807,"They're more akinto autohypnosis...","The Shining"
"201",923009,925977,"...a kind of self-induced trance.","The Shining"
"202",926178,928169,"If it reoccurs, which I doubt...","The Shining"
"203",929048,932143,"...we can always think abouthaving some tests done.","The Shining"
"204",934754,937019,"I'm sure you're right.","The Shining"
"205",938659,941355,"Have you been in Boulder long?","The Shining"
"206",942163,943461,"Only about three months.","The Shining"

"208",949038,952838,"Did the appearanceof Danny's imaginary friend....","The Shining"
"209",953277,954106,"Tony.","The Shining"
"210",954312,958270,"Did Tony's first appearance happento coincide with your arrival here?","The Shining"
"211",961386,962717,"Let's see....","The Shining"
"212",963423,965982,"I guess Danny startedtalking to Tony...","The Shining"
"213",966192,968889,"...about the time we put himin nursery school.","The Shining"
"214",969296,971594,"Did he adjust well to school?","The Shining"
"215",973801,975735,"He didn't like it too muchat first.","The Shining"
"216",975936,979235,"Then he had an injury, so we kepthim out for a while and....","The Shining"
"217",980642,984544,"I guess that's about when I firstnoticed he was talking to Tony.","The Shining"
"218",985548,987948,"What sort of injury did he have?","The Shining"
"219",988619,990779,"He dislocated his shoulder.","The Shining"
"220",991254,993519,"How did he manage to do that?","The Shining"
"221",996961,1000022,"It was just one ofthose things, you know.","The Shining"
"222",1000231,1002222,"Purely an accident.","The Shining"
"223",1003202,1006000,"My husband had been drinking...","The Shining"
"224",1006206,1009539,"...and he came homeabout three hours late.","The Shining"
"225",1009844,1014405,"So he wasn't exactlyin the greatest mood that night.","The Shining"
"226",1015149,1019917,"And Danny had scattered some of hisschool papers all over the room...","The Shining"
"227",1020121,1024423,"...and my husband grabbed his armto pull him away from them.","The Shining"
"228",1024627,1027688,"It's just the sort of thing you do100 times with a child...","The Shining"
"229",1027897,1029923,"...you know, in a parkor in the street.","The Shining"
"230",1031035,1033663,"But on this particular occasion...","The Shining"
"231",1033872,1036500,"...my husband just usedtoo much strength...","The Shining"
"232",1036708,1039303,"...and he injured Danny's arm.","The Shining"
"233",1042347,1046876,"Anyway, something good did come outof it all because he said...","The Shining"
"234",1047121,1049681,"...""Wendy, I'm never going totouch another drop.","The Shining"
"235",1049891,1051825,"And if I do, you can leave me.""","The Shining"

"1440",6985309,6986769,"Look at him!","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1441",6993525,6995735,"This man, who has brains,","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1442",6995943,6998988,"if he had decency,could have made an honest living.","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1443",6999196,7002699,"Yet, he preferred to roband murder unsuspecting women.","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1444",7002908,7004785,"He made a business of it.","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1445",7004993,7007787,"I ask for the protection of society.","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1446",7007996,7011332,"For this mass killer,I demand the extreme penalty.","Monsieur Verdoux"

"1456",7053869,7056538,"So I was forced to go into businessfor myself.","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1457",7056747,7060875,"As for being a mass killer,does not the world encourage it?","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1458",7061084,7063544,"Is it not building weaponsof destruction","Monsieur Verdoux"
"1459",7063753,7066464,"for the sole purpose of mass killing?","Monsieur Verdoux"

"746",4259255,4261089,"What was it thatfrightened you so?","Vertigo"
"747",4261174,4264885,"I stood alone on the greensearching for something.","Vertigo"
"748",4264969,4267304,"And then I startedto walk to the church.","Vertigo"
"749",4268848,4273435,"But then the darkness closed inand I was alone in the dark.","Vertigo"
"750",4273519,4277773,"Being pulled into the darkness,and I fought to wake up.","Vertigo"

"763",4397810,4400687,"Now, Madeleine, thinkof when you were here.","Vertigo"
"764",4402815,4405484,"There were notso many carriages then.","Vertigo"
"765",4407028,4409362,"There were horsesin the stalls.","Vertigo"
"766",4410698,4412824,"A bay, two black and a gray.","Vertigo"
"767",4415119,4417162,"It was our favorite place.","Vertigo"
"768",4418873,4421583,"But we were forbiddento play here.","Vertigo"
"769",4421667,4425170,"Sister Teresa would scold us.","Vertigo"
"770",4429300,4432302,"Look at this.Well, here's your gray horse.","Vertigo"
"771",4434347,4437057,"Have a little trouble getting in andout of the stall without being pushed,","Vertigo"
"772",4437141,4438517,"but even so...","Vertigo"
"773",4438601,4441353,"You see? There's ananswer for everything.","Vertigo"
"774",4445858,4448443,"Madeleine, try.","Vertigo"

"789",4531402,4533320,"You believe I love you?","Vertigo"
"790",4533404,4534571,"Yes.","Vertigo"
"791",4535740,4538325,"And if you lose me,then you'll know I...","Vertigo"

"796",4570191,4571233,"Madeleine!","Vertigo"
"797",4574320,4575654,"Madeleine!","Vertigo"
"798",4584455,4585830,"Madeleine!","Vertigo"
"799",4713417,4715126,"Ferguson.","Vertigo"
"800",4715211,4721132,"Mr. Elster, suspecting that all was notwell with his wife's mental state,","Vertigo"
"801",4721217,4725678,"took the preliminary precaution ofhaving her watched by Mr. Ferguson,","Vertigo"
"802",4725763,4728098,"lest any harm befall her.","Vertigo"
"803",4728182,4730225,"And you have heard thatMr. Elster was prepared","Vertigo"
"804",4730309,4732936,"to take his wifeto an institution,","Vertigo"
"805",4733020,4738233,"where her mental health would have beenin the hands of qualified specialists.","Vertigo"
"806",4738317,4741111,"Mr. Ferguson,being an ex-detective,","Vertigo"
"807",4741195,4745740,"would have seemed the proper choice forthe role of watchdog and protector.","Vertigo"
"808",4745825,4748952,"As you have learned,it was an unfortunate choice.","Vertigo"
"809",4749036,4752664,"However, I think you'll agree that noblame can be attached to the husband.","Vertigo"
"810",4752748,4755583,"His delay in putting his wifeunder medical care was due","Vertigo"
"811",4755668,4759212,"only to the need for informationas to her behavior,","Vertigo"
"812",4759296,4761923,"which he expected toget from Mr. Ferguson.","Vertigo"
"813",4762007,4765093,"He had taken every precautionto protect his wife.","Vertigo"
"814",4765177,4769764,"He could not have anticipated that Mr.Ferguson's weakness, his fear of heights,","Vertigo"
"815",4769849,4772767,"would make him powerlesswhen he was most needed.","Vertigo"
"816",4772852,4775437,"As to Mr. Ferguson,","Vertigo"
"817",4775521,4779649,"you have heard his former superior,Detective Captain Hansen,","Vertigo"
"818",4779733,4781943,"from that great cityto the north,","Vertigo"
"819",4782027,4784988,"testify as to hischaracter and ability.","Vertigo"
"820",4785072,4787615,"Captain Hansen wasmost enthusiastic.","Vertigo"
"821",4787700,4790785,"The fact that once before,under similar circumstances,","Vertigo"
"822",4790870,4795248,"Mr. Ferguson allowed a policecolleague to fall to his death,","Vertigo"
"823",4795332,4798960,"Captain Hansen dismissedas an ""unfortunate incident.""","Vertigo"
"824",4800880,4802964,"Of course, Mr. Fergusonis to be congratulated","Vertigo"
"825",4803048,4806176,"on having once savedthe woman's life,","Vertigo"
"826",4806260,4811139,"when, in a previous fit of aberration,she threw herself into the Bay.","Vertigo"
"827",4811223,4815477,"It is a pity that knowingher suicidal tendencies,","Vertigo"
"828",4815561,4818521,"he did not make a greatereffort the second time.","Vertigo"
"829",4821442,4823276,"But we are not hereto pass judgment","Vertigo"
"830",4823360,4827739,"on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.He did nothing.","Vertigo"
"831",4827823,4831451,"And the law has little to say onthe subject of things left undone.","Vertigo"
"832",4831535,4837624,"Nor does his strange behaviorafter he saw the body fall","Vertigo"
"833",4837708,4839667,"have any bearingon your verdict.","Vertigo"
"834",4840628,4844964,"He did not remain at thescene of the death. He left.","Vertigo"
"835",4845049,4848510,"He claims he suffered a mentalblackout and knew nothing more","Vertigo"
"836",4848594,4851804,"until he found himself back in hisown apartment in San Francisco","Vertigo"
"837",4851889,4853556,"several hours later.","Vertigo"
"838",4853641,4856267,"You may accept that, or not.","Vertigo"
"839",4857937,4862357,"Or you may believe that havingonce again allowed someone to die,","Vertigo"
"840",4862441,4866027,"he could not face the tragicresult of his own weakness","Vertigo"
"841",4866111,4867612,"and ran away.","Vertigo"
"842",4870032,4872742,"That has nothing to dowith your verdict.","Vertigo"
"843",4873244,4876454,"It is a matter between himand his own conscience.","Vertigo"
"844",4878415,4881960,"Now, from the evidence of thestate of mind of Madeleine Elster","Vertigo"
"845",4882044,4884796,"prior to her death, fromthe manner of her death,","Vertigo"

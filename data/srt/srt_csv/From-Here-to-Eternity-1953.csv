"8",34493,36703,"He can tell you more about it than I can,","From Here to Eternity"

"10",43252,49090,"I introduced the World War II to the film,","From Here to Eternity"

"15",64940,69527,"from a casting directorat Columbia, Max Arnow,","From Here to Eternity"
"16",70070,72613,"found me one afternoon and said,","From Here to Eternity"
"17",72698,75908,"""I have a part for youin From Here to Eternity.""","From Here to Eternity"
"18",75993,79287,"I said, ""I'm not an actor any more.I haven't been an actor for years.""","From Here to Eternity"
"19",79371,81497,"He said, ""Well, we have your picture here.","From Here to Eternity"

"22",91467,93176,"""and be in this movie.""","From Here to Eternity"
"23",93302,95219,"I said, ""I can't. I have a job.","From Here to Eternity"
"24",95345,98848,"""I'm selling advertising at Daily Varietyand I can't be there.""","From Here to Eternity"
"25",99016,101517,"He said, ""Buddy Adler insiststhat you be there,","From Here to Eternity"
"26",101602,104896,"""and we'll give you $400for a week's work.""","From Here to Eternity"
"27",105647,106898,"And that's how it began.","From Here to Eternity"
"28",106982,110359,"That's why I'm sitting here todaywith Tim Zinnemann.","From Here to Eternity"
"29",111737,115990,"I wanted to talk a little bit aboutthe background to From Here to Eternity,","From Here to Eternity"
"30",116074,119118,"for those who might not be aware of it.","From Here to Eternity"
"31",120078,120787,"The movie was based onan 800-page book by James Jones,","From Here to Eternity"
"32",120788,124874,"The movie was based onan 800-page book by James Jones,","From Here to Eternity"
"33",125000,128461,"which, in its day,was a big, huge best seller.","From Here to Eternity"
"34",128587,132840,"Also, it was highly critical of the Army,","From Here to Eternity"
"35",133050,138387,"and it had a lot of things in itthat for the day were considered scandalous,","From Here to Eternity"
"36",138472,141307,"like adulterous affairs, etcetera.","From Here to Eternity"
"37",141391,144811,"So it was viewed in Hollywood","From Here to Eternity"
"38",144895,149816,"as a project that wouldnot actually ever be made,","From Here to Eternity"
"39",149900,155154,"and it became known as ""Coho's Folly""for Harry Cohn,","From Here to Eternity"
"40",155239,158783,"who bought the book for Columbia.","From Here to Eternity"
"41",159076,161577,"At the time that he bought it,","From Here to Eternity"
"42",161703,168084,"he did not even have the rightsfrom the Army to get their cooperation.","From Here to Eternity"
"43",171880,177134,"It was a venture that people thoughtwould never actually get started,","From Here to Eternity"
"44",177261,179679,"and it founderedat a couple of other studios.","From Here to Eternity"
"45",180097,186978,"A young writer named Dan Taradashwas hired to do a script","From Here to Eternity"
"46",187062,190398,"and worked with the producer, Buddy Adler,","From Here to Eternity"
"47",190941,194485,"and turned in, apparently,an amazing first draft","From Here to Eternity"
"48",194611,198406,"that everybody thought extremely highly of.","From Here to Eternity"
"49",198615,204537,"As a result, they decided to fast trackthe movie and start immediately.","From Here to Eternity"
"50",206248,210585,"My father, Fred Zinnemann,had just come off High Noon,","From Here to Eternity"
"51",210711,214881,"so he was consideredan up-and-coming director.","From Here to Eternity"
"52",216633,220136,"Prior to that, he'd been knownas a director's director","From Here to Eternity"
"53",220220,221929,"or an art-house director.","From Here to Eternity"
"54",222014,226475,"Meaning, basically, you make good pictures,but they don't make any money.","From Here to Eternity"
"55",226810,231898,"So he was really not anybody's first choice,","From Here to Eternity"
"56",231982,236319,"except Dan Taradash's,who insisted that Cohn meet him.","From Here to Eternity"
"57",236570,242825,"So my father read the script, which he loved,and went in to see Harry Cohn,","From Here to Eternity"
"58",243911,250750,"who ran Columbia with an iron fist,and he was quite the tyrant","From Here to Eternity"
"59",251293,256005,"and basically insistedon getting his own way.","From Here to Eternity"
"60",256214,261510,"So he talked to my father about the script,and my father said he loved it","From Here to Eternity"
"61",262012,264138,"and would be very interested in directing it.","From Here to Eternity"
"62",264264,271187,"Cohn then said,""I have a young actor under contract here","From Here to Eternity"
"63",272147,277777,"""who's going to play the part of Prewitt.The girls love him. He's a boxer.","From Here to Eternity"
"64",279529,281948,"""He's on salaryand hasn't worked in 10 weeks,","From Here to Eternity"
"65",282032,285534,"""so I gotta put him to workand his name is Aldo Ray.""","From Here to Eternity"
"66",286036,289789,"My father just sort of said nothingand sniffed.","From Here to Eternity"
"67",290290,294126,"Cohn said, ""What's the matter?""","From Here to Eternity"
"68",294544,297922,"My father said, ""I don't thinkhe's right for the part.""","From Here to Eternity"
"69",299007,304095,"Cohn said, ""Then who would you suggest?""","From Here to Eternity"
"70",305013,307515,"My father said, ""Montgomery Clift.""","From Here to Eternity"
"71",309726,314814,"Apparently Cohn went into a rageand he said, ""Well, Clift can't box,","From Here to Eternity"
"72",315065,318234,"""he doesn't look like a soldier,","From Here to Eternity"
"73",318318,321737,"""and for all I know,he's probably a homosexual.","From Here to Eternity"
"74",321738,322405,"""And for all I know,he's probably a homosexual.","From Here to Eternity"
"75",322572,326867,"""Absolutely not. That's the mostridiculous suggestion I ever heard.""","From Here to Eternity"
"76",326994,333207,"My father said, ""If I can't cast this picturethe way I think it should be cast,","From Here to Eternity"
"77",334751,336544,"""I think it's a wonderful script,","From Here to Eternity"
"78",336628,340172,"""and what you should probably dois get another director.","From Here to Eternity"
"79",340257,342008,"""Thank you very much.""","From Here to Eternity"
"80",342092,348222,"Cohn said, ""I'm the president of Columbia.Nobody gives me ultimatums.","From Here to Eternity"
"81",348432,349932,"""Get out.""","From Here to Eternity"
"82",350058,354103,"So my father reported into his agent, who is Abe Lastfogel,","From Here to Eternity"
"83",354187,356731,"the head of William Morris,","From Here to Eternity"
"84",356815,358858,"and said, ""I just don't thinkit's going to work.","From Here to Eternity"
"85",358942,363279,"""I love the project,but we just don't see eye to eye here.","From Here to Eternity"
"86",363447,368117,"""I'm not going to do a picturewith a cast that I don't like.","From Here to Eternity"
"87",369703,370369,"""So, I'm going to pass on the project.""","From Here to Eternity"
"88",370370,373456,"""So, I'm going to pass on the project.""","From Here to Eternity"
"89",373582,377585,"Lastfogel said, ""I completelyunderstand your point of view.","From Here to Eternity"
"90",377794,379462,"""You're absolutely right.""","From Here to Eternity"
"91",379629,384967,"Then, Lastfogel got on the phone to Cohn","From Here to Eternity"
"92",385510,387386,"and said, ""Freddy loves the pictureand he can hardly wait to start.""","From Here to Eternity"
"93",387387,389764,"and said, ""Freddy loves the pictureand he can hardly wait to start.""","From Here to Eternity"
"94",390307,396062,"Much to my father's amazement,he was given a contract, which he signed.","From Here to Eternity"
"95",396646,398856,"Cohn sent the script to Clift","From Here to Eternity"
"96",398940,403652,"and the rest is on the screenas you see it today.","From Here to Eternity"
"97",405822,410201,"In terms of other ideas for casting,","From Here to Eternity"
"98",411620,415998,"Ronald Reagan was among thoseconsidered for the part of the captain,","From Here to Eternity"
"99",417084,421420,"as was Walter Matthauand some others that I can't quite remember.","From Here to Eternity"
"100",421421,422379,"As was Walter Matthauand some others that I can't quite remember.","From Here to Eternity"
"101",422923,429804,"Joan Crawford was considered to bethe lead choice for the Deborah Kerr part.","From Here to Eternity"
"102",431014,435017,"But my father and Buddy Adler and Taradash","From Here to Eternity"
"103",435185,439939,"wanted to find somebody against type,","From Here to Eternity"
"104",440065,441440,"because they thought it wouldbe much more interesting","From Here to Eternity"
"105",441441,443192,"because they thought it wouldbe much more interesting","From Here to Eternity"
"106",445821,448322,"to have somebody as the adulterous wife","From Here to Eternity"
"107",448406,452910,"who was actually quite prim and proper","From Here to Eternity"
"108",456540,461877,"and who had a very nice demeanour,so to speak.","From Here to Eternity"
"109",463046,466048,"So that's why Deborah Kerr was cast.","From Here to Eternity"
"110",473765,474974,"Who is that?","From Here to Eternity"
"111",475058,476725,"She's Captain Holmes' wife.","From Here to Eternity"
"112",476977,479436,"I never met her.","From Here to Eternity"
"113",480063,484817,"The only actors I met were Monty Clift","From Here to Eternity"
"114",484901,491866,"in the scene that I had to do for Buddy Adler.","From Here to Eternity"
"115",491950,494994,"- But was that cut out of the movie?- No, it's in the movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"116",495078,496162,"Which is it?","From Here to Eternity"
"117",496246,501750,"No, it's a scene in which I announceto Monty Clift","From Here to Eternity"
"118",504087,509466,"that Frank Sinatra's in the brigand Fatso is beating him up.","From Here to Eternity"
"119",509551,512219,"It's on the grass,just before the big fight.","From Here to Eternity"
"120",515182,519268,"There's a couple of other thingsI could mention here.","From Here to Eternity"
"121",519519,524190,"When Cohn was first developing the script,","From Here to Eternity"
"122",524274,528360,"and Buddy Adler, who had been in the Army,I believe,","From Here to Eternity"
"123",528445,534241,"was able to get the Army's permissionto do this very controversial story,","From Here to Eternity"
"124",535911,542166,"they had two scenes that they saidcould not be in the movie","From Here to Eternity"
"125",542417,546003,"that were in that current script.","From Here to Eternity"
"126",546171,551800,"One was that they didn't wantto see Maggio, or Sinatra's character,","From Here to Eternity"
"127",551968,555221,"physically abused in the brig.","From Here to Eternity"
"128",555305,560351,"They didn't want to see any violenceof that nature on screen.","From Here to Eternity"
"129",560477,562853,"So that was eliminated.","From Here to Eternity"
"130",562938,569151,"The other one was the captain,in the script,","From Here to Eternity"
"131",569277,574865,"was rewarded for his workrather than punished.","From Here to Eternity"
"132",574991,579078,"And they said that would not flyand they would not allow that.","From Here to Eternity"
"133",579329,583582,"Because in the original script,he was promoted to major.","From Here to Eternity"
"134",583708,587878,"In this version,you'll see that he's punished.","From Here to Eternity"
"135",588255,593008,"It's something they had to give in to in orderto make the picture at Schofield Barracks.","From Here to Eternity"
"136",593093,596011,"So they agreed to do that.","From Here to Eternity"
"137",597847,601058,"I'm a writer now,and when I was given the script,","From Here to Eternity"
"138",601142,605354,"the following day after this phone calland put on an aeroplane,","From Here to Eternity"
"139",606523,609942,"I was presented with Dan Taradash's script.","From Here to Eternity"
"140",610110,612486,"I had never read a movie script before.","From Here to Eternity"
"141",612654,619451,"It is a great film script,a great adaptation.","From Here to Eternity"
"142",619536,621870,"It was like going to the movies.","From Here to Eternity"
"143",621955,625374,"It taught me everythingI needed to know about writing film.","From Here to Eternity"
"144",625542,629753,"I'll never forget when I read it,how perfect it was.","From Here to Eternity"
"145",629921,636844,"I have a letter James Joneswrote to my father","From Here to Eternity"
"146",636970,640764,"about his feelings of the script,","From Here to Eternity"
"147",640849,643392,"and I just wanted to read that here.","From Here to Eternity"
"148",644894,650065,"He wrote it on January 25th, 1953,just before they went into production.","From Here to Eternity"
"149",650150,651567,"It said, ""Dear Fred,","From Here to Eternity"
"150",651651,654778,"""I'm going to call you that,since, after talking to Taradash,","From Here to Eternity"
"151",654863,656822,"""I always think of you that way.","From Here to Eternity"
"152",656906,660200,"""I want to tell you what a bang-up jobI think you two guys have done,","From Here to Eternity"
"153",660327,664913,"""along with Buddy, in gettingas much into the screenplay as you have.","From Here to Eternity"
"154",665123,669418,"""I had long expected and been resignedto a typically sentimentalized,","From Here to Eternity"
"155",669711,673005,"""crapped-up movie version of the book.","From Here to Eternity"
"156",673089,676467,"""It was a hell of a surpriseto find it wasn't that.""","From Here to Eternity"
"157",676593,682848,"So James Jones was a big fanof the script of Taradash","From Here to Eternity"
"158",683141,685601,"and of the picture,","From Here to Eternity"
"159",685727,692107,"which, as a writer, you probably knowis not always the case, is it,","From Here to Eternity"
"160",692275,694943,"- with novelists, would you say?- Absolutely.","From Here to Eternity"
"161",695737,699406,"But this particular one was extraordinary.","From Here to Eternity"
"162",699491,701867,"Then I went and read the book","From Here to Eternity"
"163",701951,705037,"and understood just whathe had been up against","From Here to Eternity"
"164",705121,707122,"and how successful it was.","From Here to Eternity"
"165",707290,711293,"I used the script oncewhen I was staying at a hotel.","From Here to Eternity"
"166",711461,718217,"Everybody stayed on Waikiki Beachback then in 1953 or '52,","From Here to Eternity"
"167",718510,722471,"and of these wonderful hotelsthat the stars stayed in,","From Here to Eternity"
"168",722639,726225,"we stayed inlandin some small place in town.","From Here to Eternity"
"169",726309,730187,"I remember there was a young waitress","From Here to Eternity"
"170",730271,734525,"who waited on us and wanted to write films.","From Here to Eternity"
"171",734651,740489,"So I showed her the script,which brought me a lot of points with her.","From Here to Eternity"
"172",741533,746161,"It never went much further than that.However, I don't remember so far back.","From Here to Eternity"
"173",748456,751875,"It was a successful script in many ways.","From Here to Eternity"
"174",752419,759341,"Going back to what Cohn said aboutAldo Ray being perfect for the part of Prewitt,","From Here to Eternity"
"175",759426,765472,"there's a description that I pulled outof the script from Taradash's first draft","From Here to Eternity"
"176",765640,769226,"describing Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt","From Here to Eternity"
"177",769310,776191,"as a ""23-year-old, deceptively slim,immaculate, decisive.","From Here to Eternity"
"178",777068,779027,"""The picture of a soldier.","From Here to Eternity"
"179",779112,783198,"""On his sleeves are markswhere chevrons have been removed.""","From Here to Eternity"
"180",784659,790998,"So the back-story of Prewitt was thathe was a corporal elsewhere,","From Here to Eternity"
"181",791082,795252,"and he had been busted to private,because he wouldn't cooperate","From Here to Eternity"
"182",795378,799882,"and he had been reassignedto Schofield Barracks.","From Here to Eternity"
"183",803303,808891,"So, actually, Clift wasvery much properly cast,","From Here to Eternity"
"184",808975,812019,"I mean, the way he is described.","From Here to Eternity"
"185",813480,814771,"He was a dear man.","From Here to Eternity"
"186",814898,819610,"I remember the scene thatI did with him was done on the squad.","From Here to Eternity"
"187",819694,821612,"The sun was baking us.","From Here to Eternity"
"188",821696,827743,"We were really all very hotand perspiring and weakened a bit.","From Here to Eternity"
"189",828244,834750,"I remember your father said,""Al, would you like a glass of water?""","From Here to Eternity"
"190",836377,838545,"I'd never acted before in a movie,","From Here to Eternity"
"191",838630,843759,"and it was my first scenethat I ever had, one of two scenes.","From Here to Eternity"
"192",844135,848430,"I said,""No, thank you. That's fine. I'm fine.""","From Here to Eternity"
"193",848806,852518,"Monty Clift was standing next to me.","From Here to Eternity"
"194",853353,856980,"He knew I wanted some water and said,""I'd like some water, Fred.""","From Here to Eternity"
"195",857065,859483,"So out they brought him a glass of water.","From Here to Eternity"
"196",859567,862736,"He drank a few sipsand offered the rest of it to me.","From Here to Eternity"
"197",862862,869743,"There was a wonderful kindness in this manthat you could just perceive right away.","From Here to Eternity"
"198",869953,874623,"There was a gentlenessand a sadness and a caring.","From Here to Eternity"
"199",874874,876625,"A beautiful man.","From Here to Eternity"
"200",876793,879836,"He had an intensity and an intelligence,","From Here to Eternity"
"201",879921,884591,"and he really knew how to getto the heart of a character.","From Here to Eternity"
"202",884717,889805,"I remember in pre-production, he knewabsolutely nothing about being a soldier.","From Here to Eternity"
"203",890098,892599,"He had no idea how to play a bugle.","From Here to Eternity"
"204",893810,896979,"He completely threw himself into the part,","From Here to Eternity"
"205",897105,901817,"and by the end, not only couldhe play the bugle, it never left his side.","From Here to Eternity"
"206",901943,906071,"He used to sit upin the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel","From Here to Eternity"
"207",906155,910951,"and play the bugle to the kidsin the school next door,","From Here to Eternity"
"208",911035,916456,"because they used to come outand go in by bugle calls.","From Here to Eternity"
"209",916541,920919,"So he would play the bugle callat the wrong time,","From Here to Eternity"
"210",921004,923297,"and all the kids wouldcome out onto the field.","From Here to Eternity"
"211",923381,926341,"He used to have a great timedoing stuff like that.","From Here to Eternity"
"212",926467,930262,"What's interesting about the characterand the actor is that,","From Here to Eternity"
"213",930346,936727,"if you think about Monty Clift,you just don't think of him as a bugler,","From Here to Eternity"
"214",936978,940022,"as playing the trumpet or any kind of horn.","From Here to Eternity"
"215",940106,942691,"And it made it even much more...","From Here to Eternity"
"216",942859,947279,"It must have been what your father saw in it,the contrast of that character, that actor,","From Here to Eternity"
"217",947363,948739,"with what he had to be.","From Here to Eternity"
"218",948823,950574,"I'm sure that excited your father,","From Here to Eternity"
"219",950700,954119,"that edge that he always wantedto give to everything.","From Here to Eternity"
"220",955872,961293,"My father saw the characteras a loner who loved the Army","From Here to Eternity"
"221",961502,963462,"and was trying to fit in,","From Here to Eternity"
"222",963671,965631,"but was also a guy","From Here to Eternity"
"223",965715,971887,"who was self-destructivein his stubbornness.","From Here to Eternity"
"224",974724,979603,"He tried to set this upin the very beginning scene,","From Here to Eternity"
"225",979729,985275,"where you see a platoon marching byand Clift coming towards camera,","From Here to Eternity"
"226",985401,988362,"and the platoon is moving across screen.","From Here to Eternity"
"227",988446,991114,"So they're moving in opposite directions,","From Here to Eternity"
"228",991240,997204,"and here is a lone soldiercoming towards camera and towards us.","From Here to Eternity"
"229",997747,1000582,"But he's an outsider within the system.","From Here to Eternity"
"230",1000750,1006380,"That's a subject that has always fascinatedmy father throughout his career,","From Here to Eternity"
"231",1008758,1011760,"which he repeated in other movies,like Nun's Story, for instance.","From Here to Eternity"
"232",1013262,1014513,"What I knew of your father,","From Here to Eternity"
"233",1014597,1018225,"when I spent time with himfor a year or two on Julia,","From Here to Eternity"
"234",1019435,1026441,"this kind of wonderful stubbornness of histhat was really fierce sometimes.","From Here to Eternity"
"235",1027527,1031405,"You had to learn how not to be frightenedand how to stand up to him.","From Here to Eternity"
"236",1031489,1034950,"It always made things much better.","From Here to Eternity"
"237",1035618,1040747,"But he always did look forthat part of himself, I think,","From Here to Eternity"
"238",1041249,1043583,"that is in all of these characters.","From Here to Eternity"
"239",1044460,1050298,"I'd say, actually,he himself was very much like Clift","From Here to Eternity"
"240",1050383,1053218,"in From Here to Eternity,","From Here to Eternity"
"241",1053970,1057806,"in that he did workwithin the Hollywood system,","From Here to Eternity"
"242",1057890,1061309,"but he stubbornly would refuse,in the beginning,","From Here to Eternity"
"243",1061477,1067065,"to do movies he didn't want to do,even though he was under contract to MGM","From Here to Eternity"
"244",1067150,1070318,"and had no right to refuse to do them.","From Here to Eternity"
"245",1072155,1074156,"But he stuck to his guns.","From Here to Eternity"
"246",1075158,1078618,"In that way, he was very similarto this character.","From Here to Eternity"
"247",1078703,1082831,"Precision, that's the big,important word for your father.","From Here to Eternity"
"248",1083374,1086376,"He was so precise about everything,","From Here to Eternity"
"249",1086502,1090756,"and when he had a scene written,at least in Julia,","From Here to Eternity"
"250",1090840,1095385,"it was finalised and there it was,and that's what he shot.","From Here to Eternity"
"251",1098222,1105187,"It gave it kind of an eloquence and elegancein everything that you saw on the screen.","From Here to Eternity"
"252",1105688,1107439,"It was very exciting.","From Here to Eternity"
"253",1107523,1113528,"When you think about From Here to Eternity,the picture was made in 41 days.","From Here to Eternity"
"254",1113613,1115697,"They had a 42-day schedule.","From Here to Eternity"
"255",1116199,1122913,"So when you see what's on the screen,they must have worked very quickly.","From Here to Eternity"
"256",1123748,1128293,"I read his script,and he has notes on every page,","From Here to Eternity"
"257",1128503,1132214,"very precise notes aboutwhere everybody is in a scene.","From Here to Eternity"
"258",1133841,1136218,"That's exactly what he did in the movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"259",1137053,1141640,"For him, the script was definitely the bible,and he really adhered to it.","From Here to Eternity"
"260",1141724,1147729,"The scene we shot,maybe there were three or four takes.","From Here to Eternity"
"261",1147980,1153068,"Then, later on, when the war begins,","From Here to Eternity"
"262",1156489,1159199,"there's a rumbling, I think, you hear.","From Here to Eternity"
"263",1159283,1163328,"The men are in their officesand at the mess hall,","From Here to Eternity"
"264",1163412,1166706,"and you hear these bombs going offin the distance.","From Here to Eternity"
"265",1166791,1170168,"Then suddenly you hear somebodyrunning across the field screaming,","From Here to Eternity"
"266",1170253,1174422,"""The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!""","From Here to Eternity"
"267",1174507,1179094,"I'll tell you how I got to do that,which is kind of a funny idea in itself.","From Here to Eternity"
"268",1179929,1185767,"It was shot witha Japanese Zero coming at us.","From Here to Eternity"
"269",1186102,1189646,"It was shot in half a day, as I remember,","From Here to Eternity"
"270",1189772,1193942,"whereas today,that would have been a few days' work.","From Here to Eternity"
"271",1194443,1198822,"It was actually very effectiveand the special effects were great.","From Here to Eternity"
"272",1198948,1202367,"There were a lot of bulletsin the ground in front of me,","From Here to Eternity"
"273",1202451,1204411,"and I had to stop at a certain spot.","From Here to Eternity"
"274",1204495,1207747,"Actually, there was anotherperson who had been given...","From Here to Eternity"
"275",1207832,1210876,"I had finished my little scenewith Monty Clift,","From Here to Eternity"
"276",1210960,1213670,"and I was standing aroundwith a bunch of people","From Here to Eternity"
"277",1213796,1215589,"watching somebody runacross the field screaming,","From Here to Eternity"
"278",1215673,1220635,"""The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!""","From Here to Eternity"
"279",1220720,1224806,"The actor did it with not very much intensity","From Here to Eternity"
"280",1224891,1228560,"and not really too worried about anything.","From Here to Eternity"
"281",1228644,1231187,"It just didn't work.","From Here to Eternity"
"282",1232648,1235400,"I remember everybody huddling","From Here to Eternity"
"283",1235484,1239821,"and deciding that actor wasn't goingto be able to pull this off.","From Here to Eternity"
"284",1239989,1241656,"I saw your father look around,","From Here to Eternity"
"285",1241782,1246161,"and I saw him wander towards this groupof guys in which I was standing.","From Here to Eternity"
"286",1246245,1250832,"I said to myself, ""He's going to comeand he's going to ask me to do that.","From Here to Eternity"
"287",1251042,1255378,"""He's going to ask me to run across the fieldand scream that the war is beginning.""","From Here to Eternity"
"288",1255463,1258423,"I felt like a little kid playing war.","From Here to Eternity"
"289",1258507,1260592,"You know, it was really exciting.","From Here to Eternity"
"290",1260676,1267015,"He said, ""Al, you think you could run acrossthe field and do that?""","From Here to Eternity"
"291",1267308,1269601,"I said, ""Yeah, I think I could.""","From Here to Eternity"
"292",1269685,1271603,"He said, ""I think you can, too.","From Here to Eternity"
"293",1271687,1276358,"""Because, Al, look up there on that roof.","From Here to Eternity"
"294",1276567,1279694,"""See the man with the machine gun?""I said, ""Yeah.""","From Here to Eternity"
"295",1279862,1282614,"He said, ""Who's that?""I said, ""Burt Lancaster.""","From Here to Eternity"
"296",1282698,1289329,"He said, ""Yeah. Now, you, Al,are a better actor than Burt Lancaster.""","From Here to Eternity"
"297",1292041,1293625,"He laughed.","From Here to Eternity"
"298",1293709,1299047,"But he was trying to give mesome belief in myself.","From Here to Eternity"
"299",1300383,1304844,"So I ran across the field, screaming,""The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!""","From Here to Eternity"
"300",1304929,1307347,"Announcing the war.","From Here to Eternity"
"301",1308599,1310517,"And very well done it was.","From Here to Eternity"
"302",1310601,1316064,"Then somebody thought I was a stuntman.I wasn't. I just decided to flip over at the end.","From Here to Eternity"
"303",1316148,1317816,"Very believable.","From Here to Eternity"
"304",1317900,1322487,"One fellow, Bob Wilke, as a matter of fact,came up and said,","From Here to Eternity"
"305",1322571,1326741,"""You know, that's really oneof the best stunts I've ever seen.""","From Here to Eternity"
"306",1326909,1328952,"I'd go along with that.","From Here to Eternity"
"307",1329036,1331329,"For some reason,","From Here to Eternity"
"308",1331414,1335291,"I just recalled this story,my father told me about Burt Lancaster.","From Here to Eternity"
"309",1336669,1338962,"They barely knew each other.","From Here to Eternity"
"310",1339046,1344092,"Burt had just been cast.He was a big movie star.","From Here to Eternity"
"311",1344844,1348054,"It was the first day of rehearsal.","From Here to Eternity"
"312",1348347,1352767,"They were blocking a scenewith Monty Clift and Burt.","From Here to Eternity"
"313",1353894,1358023,"During the rehearsal,Burt turned to Monty and said,","From Here to Eternity"
"314",1358149,1360442,"""Listen, Monty, insteadof coming from over here,","From Here to Eternity"
"315",1360526,1363778,"""why don't you go to the doorand come in that way?","From Here to Eternity"
"316",1366115,1367907,"""Let's see how that works.""","From Here to Eternity"
"317",1368743,1375123,"They started doing it the way Burthad directed Monty to play the scene.","From Here to Eternity"
"318",1375249,1380295,"And then my father waited tillhalfway through the rehearsal and said,","From Here to Eternity"
"319",1380379,1382672,"""Stop. Let's stop here.""","From Here to Eternity"
"320",1382757,1386134,"Burt was a little surprisedto be cut off in the middle of a scene,","From Here to Eternity"
"321",1386260,1388720,"especially since he was a big star.","From Here to Eternity"
"322",1388846,1393641,"My father just said quietly,""Burt, could I talk to you for a moment?""","From Here to Eternity"
"323",1394852,1400815,"Burt said, ""Sure.""So he says, ""Let's walk outside.""","From Here to Eternity"
"324",1400941,1404152,"So Burt and my father walked outside","From Here to Eternity"
"325",1405571,1407238,"and he said to Burt,","From Here to Eternity"
"326",1407323,1412327,"""Listen, I'm under the impressionthat I was hired to direct this movie","From Here to Eternity"
"327",1412411,1414662,"""and that you were hired to act in it.","From Here to Eternity"
"328",1414789,1416372,"""If that's not your impression,","From Here to Eternity"
"329",1416499,1420043,"""then perhaps we should both gosee Harry Cohn right now.""","From Here to Eternity"
"330",1421170,1426883,"Burt said, ""I'm terribly sorry.I'm just so enthusiastic about the project.","From Here to Eternity"
"331",1429553,1431846,"""I didn't mean to do that.""","From Here to Eternity"
"332",1432014,1436267,"And that was the end of it.From then on, they got along famously.","From Here to Eternity"
"333",1436393,1439187,"That must have been the dayhe told me I was a better actor than...","From Here to Eternity"
"334",1439271,1440855,"Yeah, probably.","From Here to Eternity"
"335",1441398,1444609,"But my father's way of working...","From Here to Eternity"
"336",1444693,1449114,"They called him the Iron Fistin the Velvet Glove.","From Here to Eternity"
"337",1449782,1451908,"He had a very...","From Here to Eternity"
"338",1452284,1457205,"In Julia, when we were aboutto start shooting,","From Here to Eternity"
"339",1457665,1459541,"a month away,","From Here to Eternity"
"340",1460501,1463711,"Vanessa Redgrave cameinto the room one day,","From Here to Eternity"
"341",1463838,1466381,"I was sitting there with them, and she said,","From Here to Eternity"
"342",1466465,1471553,"""Fred, I'd like to talk to you aboutthe script that I was given and agreed to do.""","From Here to Eternity"
"343",1471846,1474347,"He said, ""What's the problem, Vanessa?""","From Here to Eternity"
"344",1474557,1476808,"She said,","From Here to Eternity"
"345",1476892,1483398,"""There's a line here that was taken outregarding Karl Marx.""","From Here to Eternity"
"346",1485484,1488319,"He said, ""Yes, we've takenthat out, Vanessa.""","From Here to Eternity"
"347",1488404,1491489,"She said, ""That's not the scriptI agreed to do.","From Here to Eternity"
"348",1491574,1496077,"""I would like that nameto be back in that speech.""","From Here to Eternity"
"349",1497204,1501207,"He said, ""Well, that's not goingto be the way it is, Vanessa.","From Here to Eternity"
"350",1501292,1506462,"""I just don't think we want to talk aboutKarl Marx at that moment.""","From Here to Eternity"
"351",1506964,1509174,"She said, ""Well, I don't know, Fred.","From Here to Eternity"
"352",1509258,1513428,"""Then I don't know if I can handlethe work as I intended to.""","From Here to Eternity"
"353",1513596,1518099,"He said, ""Then we canalways recast, you know.""","From Here to Eternity"
"354",1519935,1523146,"And she said,""Well, let me give it a think.""","From Here to Eternity"
"355",1524607,1529402,"Of course, I'm shivering there,thinking we're going to lose this actor.","From Here to Eternity"
"356",1529570,1533448,"She left the roomand he called Meryl Streep on the phone.","From Here to Eternity"
"357",1533574,1537619,"She came over the next dayor two days later.","From Here to Eternity"
"358",1537745,1541039,"They had a discussion in the roomabout the part.","From Here to Eternity"
"359",1542708,1547337,"He had seen her in Shakespearein the Park in New York,","From Here to Eternity"
"360",1547421,1549547,"and she'd never been in a film before.","From Here to Eternity"
"361",1549632,1552800,"But he thought she would bea very good Julia.","From Here to Eternity"
"362",1552968,1555595,"It worked out that Vanessa just went ahead","From Here to Eternity"
"363",1555679,1559682,"and had her wardrobe fittingsand everything was fine.","From Here to Eternity"
"364",1560100,1564062,"He put Meryl Streep intoa smaller role in the movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"365",1564313,1567065,"But, boy, he just stood up for it.","From Here to Eternity"
"366",1567191,1570151,"- Yes.- He stood behind his guns, and that was that.","From Here to Eternity"
"367",1572905,1579619,"I thought I could talk also abouthow Frank Sinatra got the part of Maggio.","From Here to Eternity"
"368",1580120,1585333,"It was not by putting a horse's headin Harry Coho's bed,","From Here to Eternity"
"369",1585501,1588670,"as some people might have thought.","From Here to Eternity"
"370",1589213,1591839,"He, at that time,was married to Ava Gardner,","From Here to Eternity"

"372",1595302,1601307,"Harry Cohn was over there visiting,as it was a Columbia picture.","From Here to Eternity"
"373",1601517,1605144,"She said to Cohn,","From Here to Eternity"

"376",1612236,1613861,"At the time,","From Here to Eternity"
"377",1613946,1619993,"Sinatra was completely washed upand really not working at all.","From Here to Eternity"
"378",1622288,1625290,"Cohn was very reluctant to do it,","From Here to Eternity"
"379",1626208,1629585,"but thought about itand mentioned it to my father,","From Here to Eternity"
"380",1629712,1632797,"and then they decided to go ahead and test.","From Here to Eternity"
"381",1632881,1635967,"Cohn, who was very tightwith the bucks said,","From Here to Eternity"
"382",1636051,1639470,"""If you fly yourself over here,we'll think about it,","From Here to Eternity"
"383",1639555,1641639,"""and you have to pay for your own test.""","From Here to Eternity"
"384",1641724,1648646,"So Sinatra flew back from Africa,paid for the test and did a brilliant job","From Here to Eternity"
"385",1648731,1651149,"and immediately got the part.","From Here to Eternity"
"386",1652234,1657572,"The only other person that had beenthought of for it was Eli Wallach,","From Here to Eternity"
"387",1658115,1663494,"who was also a very good actor,but had a prior commitment with Kazan","From Here to Eternity"
"388",1663579,1667540,"to do a stage play, so he was out.","From Here to Eternity"
"389",1670961,1675381,"The closest I ever got to Frank Sinatrawas in a limousine","From Here to Eternity"
"390",1675549,1678426,"that picked him up and me at the same time.","From Here to Eternity"
"391",1678510,1680678,"For some reason,I was sitting in the front with the driver,","From Here to Eternity"
"392",1680763,1684640,"and he was in the back with somebody,I don't remember who it was.","From Here to Eternity"
"393",1684767,1687685,"All I know is they were speaking about Ava.","From Here to Eternity"
"394",1687770,1690188,"Maybe some problems with Ava,","From Here to Eternity"
"395",1690272,1693399,"I suspected,because he was very nervous about Ava,","From Here to Eternity"
"396",1693484,1695985,"""Where is Ava?"" and,""Why don't I hear from Ava?""","From Here to Eternity"
"397",1696070,1699072,"It's the best I could pick up in the front,that was it.","From Here to Eternity"
"398",1699156,1702992,"I think that was justwhen they were splitting up,","From Here to Eternity"
"399",1703077,1705870,"and it might be that she wanted himaway from her at the time.","From Here to Eternity"
"400",1705954,1709082,"So she got him a role. Very good.","From Here to Eternity"
"401",1711001,1714253,"There you are, sweetie pie.Dues all paid up.","From Here to Eternity"
"402",1714338,1717256,"Hey, who you got playing the piano there?A hippo?","From Here to Eternity"

"423",1781488,1784949,"There was to be no hintthat this was a house of prostitution.","From Here to Eternity"
"424",1785033,1788703,"So they called it a social club.","From Here to Eternity"
"425",1788871,1794959,"Donna Reed was not particularlymy father's choice.","From Here to Eternity"
"426",1797212,1801174,"She was under contract to Columbia,","From Here to Eternity"
"427",1801467,1807722,"and my father felt that he had givenCohn such a hard time about Clift","From Here to Eternity"

"429",1814438,1818399,"He was very surprised to find","From Here to Eternity"

"431",1822446,1826908,"which, in the end,gave her an Academy Award.","From Here to Eternity"
"432",1830412,1834290,"So he was extremely pleasedwith what she did.","From Here to Eternity"
"433",1834416,1838294,"One of the other things isthat my father insisted","From Here to Eternity"
"434",1838378,1840254,"that the picture be shotin black and white,","From Here to Eternity"
"435",1840380,1843758,"which was very much againstwhat the studio wanted,","From Here to Eternity"
"436",1843884,1848012,"because they thought that they would makea couple million dollars more","From Here to Eternity"
"437",1848096,1849764,"if the picture was in colour.","From Here to Eternity"
"438",1849848,1852183,"He insisted on shooting in black and white,","From Here to Eternity"
"439",1852267,1856312,"because he thought it would give ita much more realistic tone.","From Here to Eternity"
"440",1856438,1860775,"So they did go alongwith his desires on that.","From Here to Eternity"
"441",1861610,1864278,"Black and white made a big difference.","From Here to Eternity"
"442",1865364,1867907,"He shot so many of his filmsin black and white, didn't he?","From Here to Eternity"
"443",1867991,1873496,"Yeah, I think, going back in time,he was an apprentice to Robert Flaherty,","From Here to Eternity"
"444",1873580,1877208,"who was sort of the king of documentaries,","From Here to Eternity"
"445",1877292,1881796,"and he also started in photography.","From Here to Eternity"
"446",1884383,1890471,"So he was very influenced by documentariesand by Flaherty.","From Here to Eternity"
"447",1890764,1897603,"That sort of continued on throughout his lifein all the work that he did.","From Here to Eternity"
"448",1897813,1902400,"I don't knowif you felt that influence in Julia.","From Here to Eternity"
"449",1904486,1906779,"No, I don't...","From Here to Eternity"
"450",1906863,1909740,"I mean, I think he basicallyshot the script, didn't he?","From Here to Eternity"
"451",1909825,1912577,"He shot the script. It was wonderful.","From Here to Eternity"
"452",1912661,1919125,"I remember him sayingSydney Pollack was meant to do it originally.","From Here to Eternity"
"453",1919960,1925840,"Sydney was involved in itand then he pulled out.","From Here to Eternity"

"456",1940480,1945276,"And he read it and he said, ""I want to do this.I really would like to do this film.""","From Here to Eternity"
"457",1945360,1948571,"I don't think he madeany changes at all, did he?","From Here to Eternity"
"458",1948655,1952700,"We made very few changes in England.","From Here to Eternity"
"459",1954911,1958914,"We worked on that precision, you know.","From Here to Eternity"

"471",2005087,2010633,"We had lunch one daywith him and his friend.","From Here to Eternity"
"472",2011968,2018182,"And I said, ""Do you rememberFrom Here to Eternity?""","From Here to Eternity"
"473",2018266,2021477,"And I mentioned the scene,and I said, ""That's me, Fred.""","From Here to Eternity"
"474",2021561,2023938,"I remember. And he was pleased.","From Here to Eternity"
"475",2024022,2027233,"The next day, he gave mea photograph of himself","From Here to Eternity"

"477",2030821,2034240,"They signed it. I still have it on my wall.","From Here to Eternity"
"478",2035867,2041831,"I noticed the scene that's coming up herewas highly controversial at the time.","From Here to Eternity"
"479",2045210,2051549,"And I think, was it the Breen Office,it was the censorship of the day,","From Here to Eternity"
"480",2052759,2059640,"insisted that Deborah Kerrwear a skirt over her bathing suit.","From Here to Eternity"
"481",2059975,2065563,"They were insistent thatthey not touch in a certain way.","From Here to Eternity"

"488",2086710,2089170,"because of censorship at the time.","From Here to Eternity"
"489",2089463,2095176,"It's a scene that caused a big flapin its day, as I remember.","From Here to Eternity"
"490",2096887,2101557,"Must have been phone calls every dayfrom Hollywood to Honolulu,","From Here to Eternity"

"492",2104936,2107438,"Ignoring everything he could.","From Here to Eternity"
"493",2107522,2111525,"But sometimes there was too much pressureand he had to give in.","From Here to Eternity"
"494",2113862,2116071,"Let's go up to Mrs Kipfer's parlourand sit there.","From Here to Eternity"
"495",2117199,2121202,"- She was really wonderful.- Donna Reed was great.","From Here to Eternity"
"496",2122204,2127875,"I think up to this time, she'd donemainly roles of starlets and stuff.","From Here to Eternity"
"497",2128543,2133297,"- Was she on television already or...- I don't think so.","From Here to Eternity"

"502",2150565,2152858,"And then running after her.","From Here to Eternity"
"503",2152943,2158405,"And then for years, this was one of the mostfamous love scenes ever shot, I think.","From Here to Eternity"
"504",2159950,2164411,"They're so mature, these two people.It made it so much more exciting","From Here to Eternity"

"506",2168959,2173003,"There's an elegance about the way it's shot.It's the utter precision, too.","From Here to Eternity"

"509",2184182,2188352,"Because it makes it very specificand you're focused in on these two.","From Here to Eternity"

"523",2231354,2233606,"He was there,but probably wasn't answering.","From Here to Eternity"
"524",2233690,2235190,"I think that's right.","From Here to Eternity"
"525",2235275,2237610,"Yeah. Because he became very deaf.","From Here to Eternity"
"526",2237694,2240404,"That's too bad.","From Here to Eternity"
"527",2240488,2242406,"Which he was able to use as a weapon,","From Here to Eternity"
"528",2242490,2245409,"because he basically heardanything he wanted to hear.","From Here to Eternity"
"529",2245493,2248996,"But he would pretend thathe hadn't heard anything.","From Here to Eternity"
"530",2249205,2251206,"I should have sent him a note.","From Here to Eternity"
"531",2252500,2259256,"During Julia,I had the apartment next door,","From Here to Eternity"

"533",2266848,2269600,"We had two scripts.","From Here to Eternity"
"534",2272354,2277107,"We had the red script, which was my script,and there was your father's script,","From Here to Eternity"
"535",2277233,2280402,"which had certain changes in itthat we fought.","From Here to Eternity"
"536",2280487,2285491,"We used to have a big sign upon the wall in our office,","From Here to Eternity"
"537",2285617,2288535,"and it said, ""Better red than Fred.""","From Here to Eternity"
"538",2290664,2296251,"We had a good time, though.I learned a lot from your father.","From Here to Eternity"
"539",2299881,2303300,"I'd only been married to Dana two yearswhen I found out he was cheating.","From Here to Eternity"
"540",2303385,2307012,"This looks like it was shot late in the day.","From Here to Eternity"

"542",2309474,2312726,"I was almost happythe night the pains began.","From Here to Eternity"
"543",2312978,2316313,"I think this scene still holds upafter all these years.","From Here to Eternity"
"544",2316398,2318482,"It's very sensual, don't you think?","From Here to Eternity"
"545",2319067,2322069,"She's a knockout.","From Here to Eternity"
"546",2322278,2325197,"He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.","From Here to Eternity"

"548",2328618,2331245,"Did he win an Oscar,or did she win an Oscar?","From Here to Eternity"
"549",2331329,2335582,"No, they were both nominated.Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra did.","From Here to Eternity"
"550",2335750,2342214,"I think the picture was nominatedfor 13 and won eight Academy Awards.","From Here to Eternity"
"551",2342340,2349221,"My father did win and Taradash won,and the picture won and editing.","From Here to Eternity"
"552",2350390,2352683,"But in the way this is shot,","From Here to Eternity"
"553",2352767,2358981,"this very much goes back to his beginningand his influences with Flaherty.","From Here to Eternity"
"554",2359107,2360482,"It's very precise.","From Here to Eternity"
"555",2360567,2365362,"He also worked with a great man,Paul Strand, who was a still photographer.","From Here to Eternity"
"556",2365447,2367865,"He was also a cinematographer.","From Here to Eternity"
"557",2369617,2371035,"There's a real elegance","From Here to Eternity"
"558",2371119,2376582,"to how he composed his shotsand a real precision to it.","From Here to Eternity"
"559",2376791,2379418,"Did your father make some documentaries?","From Here to Eternity"
"560",2379502,2383047,"He made one and he actually wonan Academy Award for it.","From Here to Eternity"
"561",2383131,2387342,"It was for orthopaedic hospitals.It was a charity thing.","From Here to Eternity"
"562",2389971,2394516,"But no, he wanted to, and he was dyingto work with Flaherty,","From Here to Eternity"
"563",2394601,2399063,"but he wound up spending six monthsin Berlin drinking beer with Flaherty","From Here to Eternity"
"564",2399147,2404109,"and not making anything.But he did learn a lot from him.","From Here to Eternity"
"565",2405945,2410032,"Look at her. Look at that arm.","From Here to Eternity"
"566",2411826,2415829,"In my father's direction,everything is thought out.","From Here to Eternity"
"567",2415955,2418832,"It was always very precise.","From Here to Eternity"
"568",2418917,2423962,"Nothing was ever left to chance,in terms of the framing, the staging.","From Here to Eternity"
"569",2426341,2430928,"He was a big believer in preparation.He never did wing it.","From Here to Eternity"
"570",2431012,2432888,"Tell me about it.","From Here to Eternity"
"571",2434808,2438435,"But there was a security in that, too,when you worked with him.","From Here to Eternity"
"572",2438520,2444691,"You wrote, and you placed somethingon a page and it was agreed on.","From Here to Eternity"
"573",2444943,2449446,"And you felt that whatyou were going to do next,","From Here to Eternity"
"574",2449656,2454910,"whatever you were going to do,was going to be given some credibility.","From Here to Eternity"
"575",2455078,2459039,"You weren't going to have to worry about itbeing tampered with all the time.","From Here to Eternity"
"576",2459165,2460374,"Right.","From Here to Eternity"
"577",2460959,2466338,"There's a scene that's goingto be coming up later with Sinatra,","From Here to Eternity"
"578",2466506,2469299,"where he is arrested and is resisting arrest.","From Here to Eternity"
"579",2469384,2473387,"I think it was the last night of shooting.","From Here to Eternity"
"580",2474889,2479726,"Harry Cohn had come overand was not coming on the set,","From Here to Eternity"
"581",2479811,2483397,"but was getting reports back asto how everything was going.","From Here to Eternity"
"582",2483481,2485899,"There weren't really any problems.","From Here to Eternity"
"583",2486025,2491280,"They were delighted with dailiesand everything was going really well.","From Here to Eternity"
"584",2492490,2497828,"But there was some concern about the scenethat my father had staged that afternoon","From Here to Eternity"
"585",2497912,2504418,"that they were going to shoot at night, whereMaggio is standing up, resisting arrest.","From Here to Eternity"
"586",2504502,2509923,"The Army complained to Cohnand said they didn't want him to resist.","From Here to Eternity"
"587",2510049,2512467,"They just wanted him to be arrested.","From Here to Eternity"
"588",2512552,2515637,"That night, while they wereshooting the scene,","From Here to Eternity"
"589",2515722,2520893,"Cohn came on the setwith the commandant of the base","From Here to Eternity"
"590",2521436,2523979,"to watch the shooting.","From Here to Eternity"
"591",2525607,2530110,"They started to shootas they had staged the scene.","From Here to Eternity"

"593",2537660,2540120,"Contrary to my father's character","From Here to Eternity"
"594",2540205,2542873,"and contrary to everythinghe had done before,","From Here to Eternity"
"595",2542957,2544875,"he said, ""Yes, okay.""","From Here to Eternity"
"596",2546127,2551089,"I think this caused a riftwith Sinatra and my father","From Here to Eternity"
"597",2551174,2554218,"that never healed, really.","From Here to Eternity"
"598",2555136,2562017,"But my father, according to him, did thisbecause the Army insisted on it,","From Here to Eternity"
"599",2562143,2566605,"and he felt that he had pushed it to the wall,","From Here to Eternity"
"600",2566689,2570525,"and he wasn't going to get them to bend,","From Here to Eternity"
"601",2570610,2576698,"so he just gave up on that pointand had Maggio sit down in the scene,","From Here to Eternity"
"602",2577492,2580953,"which, apparently,Sinatra was very upset about.","From Here to Eternity"
"603",2581287,2584790,"...and he must have been setpretty flat on his feet...","From Here to Eternity"
"604",2584874,2589962,"I liked him sitting down. It's fine.Maybe your father knew that, too.","From Here to Eternity"
"605",2590046,2594925,"Maybe he thought, ""That's not a bad idea.I'll act as if I'm giving him something.""","From Here to Eternity"
"606",2595009,2598220,"I think in Sinatra's mind,","From Here to Eternity"
"607",2598304,2605227,"he lost respect for my fatherfor not standing up for himself.","From Here to Eternity"
"608",2613319,2617864,"You said that Clift wasa good friend of your family's?","From Here to Eternity"
"609",2618199,2622577,"- You spent a lot of time with him socially?- Well, we went back...","From Here to Eternity"
"610",2622745,2626123,"Clift did, I think, his first picture,","From Here to Eternity"
"611",2626207,2629584,"I can't remember if it was before Red Riveror right after,","From Here to Eternity"
"612",2629752,2632796,"but he got the lead ina picture called The Search","From Here to Eternity"
"613",2632880,2637551,"that my father did in Germanyright after World War II,","From Here to Eternity"
"614",2637969,2641471,"and did it very much as a documentary.","From Here to Eternity"
"615",2644058,2649229,"And Clift became a very close family friend,","From Here to Eternity"
"616",2649814,2652149,"including a friend to me.","From Here to Eternity"
"617",2652317,2655235,"He used to comeand play with me all the time.","From Here to Eternity"
"618",2655737,2658822,"He had his agent send me birthday presents.","From Here to Eternity"
"619",2658906,2660449,"His agent was Lew Wasserman,","From Here to Eternity"
"620",2660533,2664953,"so he'd send Lew Wasserman outto buy me a birthday gift.","From Here to Eternity"
"621",2666622,2671626,"- How old were you now?- When we first met Clift, I was seven or six.","From Here to Eternity"
"622",2672337,2675922,"During the making of From Here to Eternity,I was 13.","From Here to Eternity"
"623",2677300,2684097,"But Clift, until his death,was a close family friend to all of us.","From Here to Eternity"
"624",2691397,2695108,"I remember taking little walks aroundthat beach with your mother.","From Here to Eternity"
"625",2695193,2696693,"- Really?- Yeah.","From Here to Eternity"
"626",2696778,2698320,"I don't know why.","From Here to Eternity"
"627",2698613,2702407,"I found myself once walking with Fred's wife.","From Here to Eternity"
"628",2702492,2704326,"Really? That's funny.","From Here to Eternity"
"629",2705119,2707120,"All right, that's enough.","From Here to Eternity"
"630",2719634,2723095,"Okay, Prewitt, bury it.","From Here to Eternity"
"631",2731646,2735941,"Clift looks in great shape there.He does look like a middleweight.","From Here to Eternity"
"632",2736025,2738026,"Yeah, absolutely.","From Here to Eternity"
"633",2741197,2744366,"I used to go and watch himwith Mushy Callahan.","From Here to Eternity"
"634",2744492,2749913,"I used to go and watch them training.It was kind of fun.","From Here to Eternity"
"635",2750206,2753250,"So much my pockets is sore","From Here to Eternity"
"636",2753334,2755794,"Oh, my pockets is sore","From Here to Eternity"
"637",2755878,2757838,"Yeah, that a boy!","From Here to Eternity"
"638",2757922,2760841,"More dough than I can use","From Here to Eternity"

"641",2781195,2782404,"Time!","From Here to Eternity"
"642",2793583,2800213,"My father, being very precise in his thinking,","From Here to Eternity"
"643",2800298,2803300,"in the way that he shootsand the way that he prepares,","From Here to Eternity"
"644",2805553,2809389,"contrary to that,he was also a great risk-taker,","From Here to Eternity"
"645",2809474,2812517,"as Alvin was talking about with Vanessa.","From Here to Eternity"
"646",2813603,2819649,"And possibly throwing the best personfor the part out of the movie","From Here to Eternity"
"647",2820693,2824404,"just because she resisted some changes.","From Here to Eternity"
"648",2825781,2831036,"Anyway, my father,right after From Here to Eternity,","From Here to Eternity"
"649",2831245,2834915,"was riding high, extremely successful.","From Here to Eternity"
"650",2835666,2839002,"He went out and did somethingthat he'd never done before,","From Here to Eternity"
"651",2839086,2840462,"which is, bought a new car.","From Here to Eternity"
"652",2840546,2847385,"It was this fancy Jaguar that he picked upin Italy for some reason.","From Here to Eternity"
"653",2849096,2851765,"He said to me, ""Let's go for a ride.""","From Here to Eternity"
"654",2851849,2856394,"We were in Romeand he loved to drive really fast.","From Here to Eternity"
"655",2856521,2858688,"He was actually a reckless driver.","From Here to Eternity"
"656",2858814,2860440,"We were approaching Switzerland","From Here to Eternity"
"657",2860525,2865362,"at about 100 miles an hourin this fancy Mark VII Jaguar.","From Here to Eternity"
"658",2865446,2869699,"There was a gypsy caravan goinginto a tunnel ahead of us,","From Here to Eternity"
"659",2869867,2872452,"and there were two choices,","From Here to Eternity"
"660",2872620,2877082,"either slow down and go through the tunnelbehind the horse-drawn caravan,","From Here to Eternity"
"661",2877250,2880460,"or try to pass them in the tunnel.","From Here to Eternity"
"662",2880878,2886132,"The car was very bigand the caravan overhung the road.","From Here to Eternity"
"663",2886217,2890971,"It didn't look like we were all going to fit.But he decided to gun it.","From Here to Eternity"
"664",2892056,2896393,"So he passed the caravanon the wrong side of the road in the tunnel","From Here to Eternity"
"665",2898646,2901856,"with sparks coming off the driver's side,","From Here to Eternity"
"666",2901983,2906069,"because he kept hitting the tunnel wallall the way through.","From Here to Eternity"
"667",2906195,2909906,"And sparks were flying off his side,","From Here to Eternity"
"668",2909991,2915328,"and we just kept on going straight throughthe tunnel and got to the other side.","From Here to Eternity"
"669",2917081,2920834,"He had been, with me,very precise getting into the car,","From Here to Eternity"
"670",2921002,2925422,"not to put my fingerprints on the glass,and not to touch the seat","From Here to Eternity"
"671",2925506,2928883,"and not to touch the woodand all of these things,","From Here to Eternity"
"672",2929135,2932053,"and to be very carefulbecause it was brand new.","From Here to Eternity"
"673",2932138,2936266,"Now, essentially, the whole left sideof the car had been sheared off.","From Here to Eternity"
"674",2936350,2940520,"He completely played itlike nothing had happened.","From Here to Eternity"
"675",2941647,2946318,"We got out of the tunnel, past the caravan.We were still going 100 miles an hour.","From Here to Eternity"
"676",2946485,2950030,"I think we stoppedsomeplace in Italy for lunch.","From Here to Eternity"
"677",2950698,2953533,"We just pulled to a stop and he said,","From Here to Eternity"
"678",2953701,2956202,"""Excuse me, but I thinkI'd better get out your side.","From Here to Eternity"
"679",2956287,2959039,"""There's something wrong with my door.""","From Here to Eternity"
"680",2960207,2965545,"That's very much how my father was,","From Here to Eternity"
"681",2965713,2968465,"not only in life, but in his work.","From Here to Eternity"
"682",2968549,2974346,"There was definitely this dichotomywhere he was extremely precise,","From Here to Eternity"
"683",2974513,2981144,"but he was also willing to throw itall away at any time for a principle.","From Here to Eternity"
"684",2981729,2983688,"And a good story.","From Here to Eternity"
"685",2986942,2990612,"Well, good for him. I'll buy that.","From Here to Eternity"
"686",2990696,2994699,"I would have taken a long timeand been behind that cart.","From Here to Eternity"
"687",3001165,3006670,"So he was always one to take chancesin his personal life and in his work.","From Here to Eternity"
"688",3008464,3009756,"He would always...","From Here to Eternity"
"689",3012301,3018098,"In terms of From Here to Eternity,he would much rather go with Deborah Kerr,","From Here to Eternity"
"690",3018265,3020308,"who was not the popular choice,","From Here to Eternity"
"691",3020434,3022811,"who was not somebodyyou'd think of for the role,","From Here to Eternity"
"692",3022895,3028483,"as against a proven star like Joan Crawford,who not only was up for it,","From Here to Eternity"
"693",3028609,3030860,"but thought she had the role","From Here to Eternity"
"694",3030945,3034447,"and was even talking to the costumedesigner about her wardrobe.","From Here to Eternity"
"695",3034699,3037534,"I wouldn't have wantedto be in her house that night","From Here to Eternity"
"696",3037618,3040620,"- when she learned the truth.- No.","From Here to Eternity"
"697",3045167,3048837,"In all of these scenes,just look at this scene, particularly,","From Here to Eternity"
"698",3048921,3053550,"I mean, there's always a story being told.","From Here to Eternity"
"699",3054260,3057971,"Every moment there's a story.","From Here to Eternity"
"700",3058264,3065145,"The cleanliness of the scene,the sharpness of the images","From Here to Eternity"
"701",3066897,3068565,"is so much your father.","From Here to Eternity"
"702",3068649,3073111,"I remember he considered John Forda mentor, in a way,","From Here to Eternity"
"703",3073195,3075488,"and he very much admired his work.","From Here to Eternity"
"704",3076198,3079743,"Ford said to him about his earlier work,he said,","From Here to Eternity"
"705",3079827,3084581,"""You know, kid, you've got potential,but you move the camera too much.","From Here to Eternity"
"706",3085291,3088835,"""Just remember the camerais an information booth","From Here to Eternity"
"707",3088919,3091254,"""and let the people come to you.""","From Here to Eternity"
"708",3091338,3094090,"I think that's somethingthat stuck with my father, too.","From Here to Eternity"
"709",3094175,3098094,"I've watched himand what I found was that he...","From Here to Eternity"
"710",3098179,3101514,"And then I started doing it in writing, too.","From Here to Eternity"
"711",3103225,3107729,"He doesn't move in on faces.","From Here to Eternity"
"712",3108522,3115528,"He cuts closer and cuts closer,but there's never that zooming in.","From Here to Eternity"
"713",3118365,3120742,"Because I don't thinkthat's how stories are told, anyway.","From Here to Eternity"
"714",3120868,3127332,"You always tell a story... A story's like a...","From Here to Eternity"
"715",3128918,3135799,"A movie's like a joke. Like you tell a joke,that's how you tell a movie, a story.","From Here to Eternity"
"716",3136133,3141721,"So this happened, two guys came into a bar.They stood in front of the bartender.","From Here to Eternity"
"717",3141847,3146559,"An elephant walked in the door.You know, it's all very quick, very precise.","From Here to Eternity"
"718",3146852,3150980,"Dreams are also, I think, very much...","From Here to Eternity"
"719",3151065,3155819,"I write when I think about cutting,moving a story along,","From Here to Eternity"
"720",3155903,3160073,"I think about, ""Does it work in a dream?Does it work in a joke?""","From Here to Eternity"
"721",3160241,3163243,"When you tell a tale... And your father...","From Here to Eternity"
"722",3163786,3168081,"I don't know if this appliesto what I'm talking about with your father,","From Here to Eternity"
"723",3168207,3171709,"but if you watch, you don't seea lot of camera movement.","From Here to Eternity"
"724",3171794,3176422,"You don't see a lot of... God.Zooming in and out.","From Here to Eternity"
"725",3176549,3178216,"Panning, very little panning.","From Here to Eternity"
"726",3178300,3182095,"No, he was a very good editor","From Here to Eternity"
"727",3182179,3187267,"and relied on good editors,such as Walter Murch","From Here to Eternity"
"728",3187351,3192605,"and a lot of people that he worked withto really let them do their job.","From Here to Eternity"
"729",3195109,3201698,"- Murch was very helpful on Julia.- I'm sure he was.","From Here to Eternity"
"730",3201782,3204534,"But he definitely listened to the editors,","From Here to Eternity"
"731",3204618,3207120,"and he gave them the respectthat they're due.","From Here to Eternity"
"732",3208122,3211416,"Editing was very important to him.","From Here to Eternity"
"733",3211500,3213251,"He was an editor, wasn't he?","From Here to Eternity"
"734",3213335,3216838,"He began as an assistantcameraman in Berlin.","From Here to Eternity"
"735",3216922,3221217,"He worked with Billy Wilderon his first movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"736",3221343,3226139,"He came to Hollywood,hoping to break in as a cameraman.","From Here to Eternity"
"737",3226557,3231728,"His first job was as an extra as a Germanlieutenant on All Quiet on the Western Front.","From Here to Eternity"
"738",3231812,3233313,"Really?","From Here to Eternity"
"739",3234273,3238860,"He was told by the first assistant directorto do something and he said no.","From Here to Eternity"
"740",3238986,3242113,"He got fired, which is typical of him.","From Here to Eternity"
"741",3242197,3244073,"Glad he was acting.","From Here to Eternity"
"742",3249872,3252916,"But in terms of his camera set-ups,","From Here to Eternity"
"743",3253042,3260006,"he's always doing it being terribly awareof how he's going to edit the picture.","From Here to Eternity"
"744",3262468,3264928,"He also started in the shorts department,","From Here to Eternity"
"745",3266555,3270350,"so he learned how to tell a story,say of George Washington,","From Here to Eternity"
"746",3270434,3274771,"80 years of George WashingtonCarver's life in 10 minutes.","From Here to Eternity"
"747",3274897,3280652,"So there was always this economyto his style.","From Here to Eternity"
"748",3282696,3286741,"He always knewwhere he was going to go with the material.","From Here to Eternity"
"749",3286825,3290495,"Also, in these days, in the '50s,","From Here to Eternity"
"750",3290579,3297126,"people like Harry Cohndid interfere with editing a lot,","From Here to Eternity"
"751",3297336,3302215,"the process, and they did have final cutand the directors didn't.","From Here to Eternity"
"752",3302508,3305635,"In the case of From Here to Eternity,","From Here to Eternity"
"753",3305719,3310181,"I think they shot it in the spring of '53,","From Here to Eternity"
"754",3310265,3315687,"and they had it edited by June","From Here to Eternity"
"755",3315771,3317188,"and in the theatres by August.","From Here to Eternity"
"756",3317272,3319941,"So it's a very fast schedule.","From Here to Eternity"
"757",3322611,3327573,"They didn't give my father much timeto edit the movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"758",3327658,3331577,"Cohn came right in and took it overand made his changes,","From Here to Eternity"
"759",3331662,3336249,"and my father had to fight tooth and nailfor what he believed in with Cohn.","From Here to Eternity"
"760",3338002,3343965,"The picture was released in Augustin the biggest theatre on Broadway,","From Here to Eternity"
"761",3345092,3347635,"which was not air-conditioned.","From Here to Eternity"
"762",3349054,3353474,"It was regarded asa very foolish move by many,","From Here to Eternity"
"763",3353600,3356352,"but Cohn took full responsibility for it.","From Here to Eternity"
"764",3356437,3359689,"They didn't do a press previewfor the picture.","From Here to Eternity"
"765",3359773,3361607,"They just released it.","From Here to Eternity"
"766",3361775,3364736,"On the first night at midnight,","From Here to Eternity"
"767",3364820,3369032,"Marlene Dietrich called my father,who he didn't know that well,","From Here to Eternity"
"768",3369158,3375121,"and said there's lines around the blockand they've added a 1:00 show.","From Here to Eternity"
"769",3375497,3378499,"Then everybody knewit was going to be a big hit.","From Here to Eternity"
"770",3378625,3380043,"Great.","From Here to Eternity"
"771",3381670,3384714,"They opened it here at the Pantages Theater.","From Here to Eternity"
"772",3384965,3388843,"I went back after my week or soon this movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"773",3389136,3394140,"I went back to selling advertisingat Daily Variety.","From Here to Eternity"
"774",3394224,3399771,"They opened the movie five months later,whenever it was, six months later,","From Here to Eternity"
"775",3401648,3406194,"and I went to the premiere by myself, I think.","From Here to Eternity"
"776",3406820,3413534,"And sat there, somehow I got inand watched this movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"777",3413660,3419916,"Suddenly there I was,this amazing full close-up","From Here to Eternity"
"778",3420125,3423461,"on the Pantages movie house screen.","From Here to Eternity"
"779",3424671,3426839,"It must have been a thrill.","From Here to Eternity"
"780",3426965,3430510,"I didn't know if it was a thrillor embarrassing, I couldn't tell.","From Here to Eternity"
"781",3430594,3433262,"It's like listening to your own voice.","From Here to Eternity"
"782",3433806,3436682,"That scene will be coming uphere in a minute.","From Here to Eternity"
"783",3438519,3443356,"But there was definitely a feelingabout this movie in pre-production","From Here to Eternity"
"784",3443440,3445900,"that it was a great script and a great project.","From Here to Eternity"
"785",3445984,3448986,"I remember the opening night,the premiere there.","From Here to Eternity"
"786",3449071,3451948,"It was a thrilling night.","From Here to Eternity"
"787",3452074,3456994,"Everybody just couldn't get over it.","From Here to Eternity"
"788",3457913,3460164,"My own personal recollection,","From Here to Eternity"
"789",3460249,3464127,"I had just been for the summertouring Europe","From Here to Eternity"
"790",3464378,3466546,"with some people from my school","From Here to Eternity"
"791",3466630,3469590,"and met my father in New Yorkjust as the picture...","From Here to Eternity"
"792",3469716,3473803,"I think it was in its first week,I forget the theatre, on Broadway.","From Here to Eternity"
"793",3474012,3478891,"He said to me, ""Do you want to go seemy latest picture, From Here to Eternity?""","From Here to Eternity"
"794",3479017,3482270,"And I said, ""Sure, I'd be thrilled.""","From Here to Eternity"
"795",3482354,3488067,"It was the first time he'd allowed me to seeone of his pictures, other than High Noon.","From Here to Eternity"
"796",3489319,3492405,"So we went to the theatre.","From Here to Eternity"
"797",3492739,3497952,"It was a really hot day, and we got closeand there was this huge long line","From Here to Eternity"
"798",3498036,3500329,"that went all the way around the block.","From Here to Eternity"
"799",3500414,3502748,"We got right up to the front door.","From Here to Eternity"
"800",3502916,3506794,"He talked to somebody thereand they let us right in.","From Here to Eternity"
"801",3507129,3510381,"I was completely impressed.","From Here to Eternity"
"802",3510465,3513926,"The long line was for the next show.","From Here to Eternity"
"803",3514011,3518556,"There was a show in progress,so they were in line waiting for two hours.","From Here to Eternity"
"804",3519474,3522143,"We went in and sat down.","From Here to Eternity"
"805",3522227,3526397,"It was a theatre that held 2,000 people.It was a big deal.","From Here to Eternity"
"806",3527107,3530860,"That was the first momentthat I knew my father had made it.","From Here to Eternity"
"807",3530944,3534113,"Because prior to that,he was an art-house director,","From Here to Eternity"
"808",3534198,3539118,"and we lived in a small houseand drove an old car.","From Here to Eternity"
"809",3539286,3541287,"This was his big moment.","From Here to Eternity"
"810",3541413,3546417,"Great. He shared it. Beautiful.Big moment in your life.","From Here to Eternity"
"811",3548295,3550296,"I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.","From Here to Eternity"
"812",3556803,3560139,"- There's Bob Wilke.- There's Bob Wilke.","From Here to Eternity"
"813",3560515,3562308,"Maggio, get ready for guard.","From Here to Eternity"
"814",3562684,3564101,"Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.","From Here to Eternity"
"815",3564186,3566437,"He was also in High Noon, actually.","From Here to Eternity"
"816",3566521,3568856,"- Was he one of the three guys?- Yeah.","From Here to Eternity"
"817",3568941,3571150,"Not any more. Anderson's sick.You're on guard.","From Here to Eternity"
"818",3571235,3572568,"I just had guard yesterday.","From Here to Eternity"
"819",3572653,3574445,"That was a great film.","From Here to Eternity"
"820",3574529,3577156,"You should've gotten dressed faster.","From Here to Eternity"
"821",3584665,3587750,"I sure never figuredin your giving me the runaround.","From Here to Eternity"
"822",3587834,3590795,"- They didn't even want to let me in this place.- We're mobbed, that's why.","From Here to Eternity"
"823",3591588,3594632,"Talking about editing,","From Here to Eternity"
"824",3596927,3600429,"the way things worked in 1953,","From Here to Eternity"
"825",3600514,3604433,"Harry Cohn had the final cut.","From Here to Eternity"
"826",3606853,3611399,"A lot of the things that the directorsof those days did in self-defence","From Here to Eternity"
"827",3611483,3616195,"was what they used to call camera-cutting,","From Here to Eternity"
"828",3616280,3623244,"and not give what they called ""thefront office"" enough coverage to work with,","From Here to Eternity"
"829",3623370,3627373,"so that a scene could only be cut in one way.","From Here to Eternity"
"830",3627457,3630459,"And this was a trickmy father learned early on","From Here to Eternity"
"831",3630544,3636716,"and utilised in most of his movies up tothis point, including From Here to Eternity.","From Here to Eternity"
"832",3638135,3642638,"So I think a lot of thatwas why he was so precise.","From Here to Eternity"
"833",3644599,3649729,"It was just a way to protect himselfand protect his vision of the movie.","From Here to Eternity"
"834",3653066,3655901,"As I think I said before, the picture","From Here to Eternity"
"835",3658071,3663117,"was made quite quickly, in today's terms.","From Here to Eternity"
"836",3663201,3665411,"So it was made in eight weeks.","From Here to Eternity"
"837",3667164,3672418,"The cutting period was only abouttwo months before they went to a preview.","From Here to Eternity"
"838",3675088,3679925,"I think that they found in the first previewthat they were going to have a monstrous hit,","From Here to Eternity"
"839",3680927,3684680,"because they utilised somethingthat was new for the time.","From Here to Eternity"
"840",3684765,3691228,"They wired every seat in the preview theatre,","From Here to Eternity"
"841",3691313,3695608,"and they were able to getthe response of everybody","From Here to Eternity"
"842",3695692,3698527,"to each particular sceneat any given moment.","From Here to Eternity"
"843",3698612,3701947,"And apparently, Harry Cohn","From Here to Eternity"
"844",3702032,3706035,"came out with a 25-foot-long roll of paper","From Here to Eternity"
"845",3706119,3711791,"with a graph that showed everybody'sreaction to everything in the picture,","From Here to Eternity"
"846",3711875,3716796,"and came screaming down the aislesand saying, ""We have a hit! We have a hit!""","From Here to Eternity"
"847",3716880,3719715,"And I don't believethey ever previewed the picture again.","From Here to Eternity"
"848",3719800,3723052,"And they just decided to release it in August.","From Here to Eternity"
"849",3723136,3726639,"So from inception to release,","From Here to Eternity"
"850",3728642,3732561,"it was less than a year,which was very fast.","From Here to Eternity"
"851",3734606,3736732,"See, I'm just lucky getting in town.","From Here to Eternity"
"852",3736817,3740111,"- Topkick gave me a break.- They still pouring it on?","From Here to Eternity"
"853",3740195,3742988,"Holmes and those others,they really got me on the edge.","From Here to Eternity"
"854",3743073,3746575,"- Gee, you must hate the army.- No, I don't hate the army.","From Here to Eternity"
"855",3746660,3748577,"But look what it's doing to you.","From Here to Eternity"
"856",3748662,3750746,"I love the army.","From Here to Eternity"
"857",3751790,3754083,"But it sure doesn't love you.","From Here to Eternity"
"858",3755293,3757586,"A man loves a thing,that don't mean it's gotta love him back.","From Here to Eternity"
"859",3757671,3763926,"I was just wonderingwhen you were at home and Clift was around,","From Here to Eternity"
"860",3764010,3766095,"were you making the movie then?","From Here to Eternity"
"861",3766179,3767179,"Did he...","From Here to Eternity"
"862",3767264,3769682,"- What, From Here to Eternity?- Yeah.","From Here to Eternity"
"863",3769766,3770766,"Well, he...","From Here to Eternity"
"864",3770851,3773102,"Was there any discussion about...","From Here to Eternity"
"865",3773186,3777690,"What I'm getting at is,was there much discussion about the film,","From Here to Eternity"
"866",3777774,3780818,"or was your father always awaywhen he was shooting this?","From Here to Eternity"
"867",3780902,3786115,"They were away, and they workedintensely and closely together.","From Here to Eternity"
"868",3786199,3790202,"My experience with Clift","From Here to Eternity"
"869",3790287,3794123,"was after he came backand he was still in character.","From Here to Eternity"
"870",3794207,3799462,"And he was still wandering aroundin Hawaiian shirts and clutching his bugle.","From Here to Eternity"
"871",3801381,3803799,"I remember going toDon The Beachcomber's,","From Here to Eternity"
"872",3803884,3808387,"which was a very chic place at the timeto go for dinner.","From Here to Eternity"
"873",3810390,3815811,"He got extremely obnoxiousand very rude and very drunk.","From Here to Eternity"
"874",3816480,3817646,"And he had his bugle,","From Here to Eternity"
"875",3817731,3823486,"which he was blowing in the middleof dinner and getting everybody very upset.","From Here to Eternity"
"876",3827157,3828949,"This is working on the role, right?","From Here to Eternity"
"877",3829034,3833496,"Well, no, this was after he had finishedand he couldn't get out of the role.","From Here to Eternity"
"878",3835665,3838667,"And somebody came up to the tableand said,","From Here to Eternity"
"879",3838752,3841462,"""Listen, you're upsetting my wife,and you're upsetting me.","From Here to Eternity"
"880",3841546,3845925,"""And we're trying to have a peaceful dinner.Just, will you cut it out?""","From Here to Eternity"
"881",3848845,3852181,"And Clift told him where to go and stood up,","From Here to Eternity"
"882",3852265,3857853,"and then the guy decked himand knocked him out completely,","From Here to Eternity"
"883",3857938,3862358,"and he was on the floor with bloodgushing out of his nose, clutching his bugle.","From Here to Eternity"
"884",3862442,3867696,"And then the ma�tre d' came over andthought it would be a good idea if we left.","From Here to Eternity"
"885",3869533,3872785,"This isn't that kind, gentle fellowI was talking about earlier.","From Here to Eternity"
"886",3872869,3874203,"- Who, Clift?- Clift.","From Here to Eternity"
"887",3874287,3876914,"He had his moments both ways, I'd say.","From Here to Eternity"
"888",3878625,3881710,"You get your tail right back to the post.You're in trouble. You know that.","From Here to Eternity"
"889",3882712,3886048,"So many of these people are...","From Here to Eternity"
"890",3886132,3889051,"I don't want to talk about that,but passed away.","From Here to Eternity"
"891",3889135,3892054,"So few people are left.","From Here to Eternity"
"892",3892138,3894974,"- That's amazing how few there are.- Yeah.","From Here to Eternity"
"893",3895642,3897643,"You'd better go.","From Here to Eternity"
"894",3899312,3903691,"What's interesting to me is how this movie,watching it, still holds up.","From Here to Eternity"
"895",3907571,3913492,"I don't know what to attribute it to other thangood acting, good script, good direction.","From Here to Eternity"
"896",3913577,3917580,"But it's something that'sreally stood the test of time, I think.","From Here to Eternity"
"897",3917664,3919582,"Yeah, you're awake.Put your clothes on, all right?","From Here to Eternity"
"898",3919666,3922334,"Give them back to the Indians.The Indians need the clothes.","From Here to Eternity"
"899",3922419,3926922,"Look at the structure of that shot.","From Here to Eternity"
"900",3932012,3936056,"He staged everything so beautifully.","From Here to Eternity"
"901",3936141,3942980,"I think part of the reason that they were ableto do movies in eight weeks then","From Here to Eternity"
"902",3943064,3946108,"was that they were so preciseabout what they were doing,","From Here to Eternity"
"903",3946192,3948694,"and things were so well thought out.","From Here to Eternity"
"904",3949863,3952573,"They didn't really use multiple cameras.","From Here to Eternity"
"905",3956703,3958912,"Things were just a lot easier.","From Here to Eternity"
"906",3960040,3962916,"Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.","From Here to Eternity"

"914",3983813,3985939,"- Nothing back here at all?- Nothing.","From Here to Eternity"
"915",3987567,3993238,"I think this is the scene coming upthat was the one I was talking about earlier.","From Here to Eternity"

"930",4063476,4066145,"See, going back to what I was saying earlier","From Here to Eternity"
"931",4066229,4070899,"about my father'sbeing influenced by documentaries,","From Here to Eternity"
"932",4070984,4075571,"you can see how he used practical locations.","From Here to Eternity"
"933",4077490,4079742,"He used very few sets.","From Here to Eternity"
"934",4079826,4084413,"And this is somethingthat's commonplace now, but in those days,","From Here to Eternity"
"935",4085665,4087374,"it was rarely done.","From Here to Eternity"
"936",4088668,4091837,"It's another thing he utilised,practical locations.","From Here to Eternity"
"937",4091921,4095007,"It was very important to himto get a real look.","From Here to Eternity"
"938",4103600,4107686,"There was, I think, about another 20 minutesin the original script","From Here to Eternity"
"939",4107771,4113275,"where Sinatra is beat up in jail.","From Here to Eternity"
"940",4113359,4118697,"And that was one of the cutsthat the Army insisted upon.","From Here to Eternity"
"941",4120116,4124328,"And Taradash and my fathergladly agreed to it,","From Here to Eternity"
"942",4124412,4127456,"because they thoughtthe movie was too long, anyway.","From Here to Eternity"

"1072",4703449,4707452,"So you didn't really have to act,you just had to respond to him.","From Here to Eternity"
"1073",4709038,4711081,"When I saw that close-up,","From Here to Eternity"
"1074",4711165,4714626,"I was sitting with some other guyfrom the advertising department.","From Here to Eternity"

"1078",4724720,4727305,"You've still got timeto help us win the championship.","From Here to Eternity"
"1079",4731894,4735730,"I might have said this before,but my father said about Clift,","From Here to Eternity"

"1082",4743239,4745407,"They all had to rise...","From Here to Eternity"
"1083",4745491,4750578,"That should have been my reply to youbecause that's absolutely the way it was.","From Here to Eternity"
"1084",4750663,4753915,"He committed you to what you had to do.","From Here to Eternity"
"1085",4753999,4756084,"- So you had to be as excellent as you could.- You just did.","From Here to Eternity"
"1086",4756168,4757502,"Absolutely.","From Here to Eternity"
"1087",4757586,4759045,"That's great.","From Here to Eternity"

"1096",4813559,4815643,"Lee Marvin, the actor.","From Here to Eternity"
"1097",4815728,4817687,"And I said,""What do you think I should do?""","From Here to Eternity"

"660",3425217,3427381,"Carlisle's right.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"661",3427381,3429739,"That's whythey are created.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"662",3430324,3434221,"A newborn army, doesn't needthousands like a human army.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"663",3434944,3437321,"And no human armycould stand against them.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"664",3439191,3442270,"The two most important thingsto remember are, first...","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"665",3442270,3443933,"Never let themget their arms around you.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"

"680",3619408,3623035,"Your presence alone,your scent will distract the newborns.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"681",3623035,3627443,"Their hunting instinct will take over,drive them crazy.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"682",3628564,3630697,"Good. I'm glad.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"683",3632788,3634374,"Hey.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"684",3634374,3636528,"How do you know so muchabout this?","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"685",3638050,3642507,"I didn't have quite the same upbringingas my adopted siblings.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"686",3648440,3650068,"Those bites are like mine.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"687",3650911,3652463,"Battle scars.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"688",3654013,3656745,"All the training the Confederate Armygave me...","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"689",3656745,3659042,"was useless againstthe newborns.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"690",3660102,3664049,"Still,I never lost a fight.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"691",3668878,3671850,"This has happenedduring the civil war?","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"692",3671850,3674701,"I was the youngest majorin the Texas cavalry.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"

"700",3697029,3699183,"I immediately offered her my aid.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"701",3706859,3710045,"Lovely. And an officer.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"702",3717009,3722209,"You'd better do it, Maria.I can never stop once I've started.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"

"708",3745050,3748758,"And cost a brutal battlesfor territory.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"709",3748758,3750792,"Maria won them all.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"710",3751646,3756646,"She was smart, careful.And she had me.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"711",3759093,3761938,"I was the second in command.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"712",3761938,3765783,"My abilities to control emotionsserved her well.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"713",3766683,3768691,"I trained her newborns.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"714",3771747,3776161,"An endless occupation since she neverlet them live beyond their first year.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"715",3779160,3781580,"It was my jobto dispose of them.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"716",3802156,3805031,"I could feeleverything they felt.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"717",3817617,3820339,"I thought what Maria and I hadwas love.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"718",3821727,3826427,"But I was her puppet.She pulled the strings.","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"
"719",3827594,3830052,"I didn't knowthere was another way...","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"

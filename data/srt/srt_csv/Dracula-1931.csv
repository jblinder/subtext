"246",2116100,2120766,"I might have known.I might have known.","Dracula"
"247",2122234,2125688,"We know why the wolves talk,","Dracula"
"248",2125768,2129621,"do we not, Mr. Renfield?","Dracula"

"250",2134151,2136787,"Aaah!","Dracula"
"251",2136827,2141118,"- You know too much to live, Van Helsing.- Now, now, Renfield.","Dracula"

"253",2146283,2150989,"- Take him away, Martin.- On your way, old fly eater.","Dracula"

"255",2157337,2160953,"you must answerfor what will happen to Miss Mina!","Dracula"
"256",2161036,2164496,"- All right, Martin.- Come along, now, come along.","Dracula"
"257",2166037,2169498,"What was that herbthat excited him so?","Dracula"
"258",2169581,2174089,"Wolfbane. It is a plantthat grows in central Europe.","Dracula"
"259",2174172,2178585,"The natives there use itto protect themselves against vampires.","Dracula"
"260",2178667,2182215,"Renfield reactedvery violently to its scent.","Dracula"
"261",2182302,2186548,"Seward, I want youto have Renfield closely watched...","Dracula"
"262",2186631,2189214,"by day and night, especially by night.","Dracula"

"270",2242741,2247237,"Please! Oh, don't!","Dracula"
"271",2287293,2292133,"I lay in bedfor quite a while, reading.","Dracula"
"272",2292216,2295921,"And just as I wascommencing to get drowsy,","Dracula"
"273",2296004,2299258,"I heard dogs howling.","Dracula"
"274",2300511,2303512,"And when the dream came,","Dracula"
"275",2303596,2306758,"it seemed the whole roomwas filled with mist.","Dracula"
"276",2306842,2309761,"It was so thick...","Dracula"
"277",2309845,2313099,"I could just see the lamp by the bed,","Dracula"
"278",2313182,2316054,"a tiny spark in the fog.","Dracula"
"279",2316136,2320683,"And then I saw two red eyesstaring at me,","Dracula"
"280",2320768,2326059,"and a white livid facecame down out of the mist.","Dracula"
"281",2327975,2330441,"It came closer...","Dracula"
"282",2330482,2332653,"and closer.","Dracula"
"283",2333568,2338401,"I felt its breath on my face,and then its lips.","Dracula"
"284",2338482,2342320,"- Oh.- Dear, it was only a dream.","Dracula"
"285",2342405,2346693,"And then, in the morning,I felt so weak.","Dracula"
"286",2346775,2349988,"It seemed as if all the lifehad been drained out of me.","Dracula"
"287",2350069,2354073,"Darling, we're goingto forget all about these dreams,","Dracula"
"288",2354156,2356447,"think about something cheerful,aren't we?","Dracula"

"290",2358948,2361452,"Oh, certainly, Professor.","Dracula"
"291",2361537,2364119,"Think for a moment.","Dracula"
"292",2364202,2368786,"Is there anything that might havebrought this dream on?","Dracula"
"293",2370705,2371872,"No.","Dracula"
"294",2372458,2375786,"Doctor, there's somethingtroubling Mina,","Dracula"
"295",2375828,2377789,"something she won't tell us.","Dracula"
"296",2377831,2381250,"And the face in the dream,","Dracula"
"297",2381334,2386332,"you say it seemed to comecloser and closer?","Dracula"
"298",2386415,2391295,"The lips touched you? Where?","Dracula"
"299",2391338,2394129,"Is there anything the matterwith your throat?","Dracula"
"300",2394172,2396544,"- Oh, no, but l...- Permit me.","Dracula"
"301",2396626,2399422,"- No, please!- Yes, yes.","Dracula"
"302",2405422,2408550,"How long have you hadthose little marks?","Dracula"
"303",2408635,2409968,"Marks?","Dracula"
"304",2410008,2413637,"- Please.- Mina, why didn't you let us know?","Dracula"
"305",2413719,2415674,"Do not excite her.","Dracula"
"306",2418302,2420679,"When, Miss Mina?","Dracula"
"307",2422933,2426637,"Since the morning after the dream.","Dracula"
"308",2429226,2431231,"What could havecaused them, Professor?","Dracula"
"309",2431314,2432901,"Count Dracula!","Dracula"
"310",2438607,2441401,"It's good to see youback again, Doctor.","Dracula"
"311",2441483,2444854,"I heard you have just arrived.","Dracula"

"313",2454319,2457530,"Pardon me, Dr. Seward,","Dracula"
"314",2457612,2460531,"but I think Miss Mina shouldgo to her room at once.","Dracula"
"315",2460576,2461908,"Professor Van Helsing,","Dracula"
"316",2461993,2464573,"I don't believe it's as importantas you seem to think it is.","Dracula"
"317",2464657,2467824,"Excuse me.Count Dracula, Professor Van Helsing.","Dracula"
"318",2473331,2475700,"Van Helsing.","Dracula"
"319",2475741,2480374,"A most distinguished scientistwhose name we know...","Dracula"
"320",2480455,2483500,"even in the wilds of Transylvania.","Dracula"
"321",2485954,2489582,"I had a frightful dreama few nights ago,","Dracula"
"322",2489668,2491876,"and I don't seem to be ableto get it out of my mind.","Dracula"
"323",2491917,2494541,"I hope you haven't takenmy stories too seriously.","Dracula"
"324",2494624,2496080,"Stories?","Dracula"
"325",2498084,2500047,"Yes.","Dracula"
"326",2500961,2505125,"In my humble effort to amuseyour fianc�e, Mr. Harker,","Dracula"
"327",2505210,2509173,"I was telling hersome rather grim tales...","Dracula"
"328",2509255,2511802,"of my far-off country.","Dracula"
"329",2511885,2516089,"- I can imagine.- Why, John!","Dracula"
"330",2520636,2524427,"I can quite understandMr. Harker's concern.","Dracula"
"331",2524511,2526718,"I'm afraid it's quite serious.","Dracula"
"332",2526760,2530561,"My dear, I'm sureCount Dracula will excuse you.","Dracula"
"333",2530642,2533271,"You must go to your roomas Professor Van Helsing suggests.","Dracula"

"340",2577574,2580864,"I'm sorry, Doctor.My visit was so ill-timed.","Dracula"
"341",2580904,2582405,"Not at all.","Dracula"
"342",2582488,2586904,"On the contrary, it may proveto be most enlightening.","Dracula"
"343",2586985,2591327,"In fact, before you go,you can be of definite service.","Dracula"
"344",2591408,2595322,"Anything I can do. Gladly.","Dracula"
"345",2599952,2603162,"A moment ago,I stumbled upon...","Dracula"
"346",2603244,2606366,"a most amazing phenomenon,","Dracula"
"347",2606454,2609869,"something so incredible...","Dracula"
"348",2609913,2613747,"I mistrust my own judgment.","Dracula"
"349",2613829,2616285,"Look.","Dracula"
"350",2635294,2638551,"Dr. Seward, my humble apology.","Dracula"
"351",2638633,2641638,"I dislike mirrors.","Dracula"
"352",2641720,2645217,"Van Helsing will explain.","Dracula"
"353",2656719,2661309,"For one who has not livedeven a single lifetime,","Dracula"
"354",2661392,2666098,"you are a wise man, Van Helsing.","Dracula"
"355",2669060,2672772,"- Whew.- What on earth caused that?","Dracula"
"356",2672813,2675646,"Did you see the look on his face?Like a wild animal!","Dracula"
"357",2675729,2677979,"Wild animal? Like a madman!","Dracula"
"358",2680235,2684731,"What's that running across the lawn?Looks like a huge dog!","Dracula"
"359",2684814,2687610,"Or a wolf?","Dracula"
"360",2689613,2693407,"- A wolf?- He was afraid we might follow.","Dracula"
"361",2693488,2697737,"- Follow?- Sometimes they take the form of wolves,","Dracula"
"362",2697821,2700616,"but generally of bats.","Dracula"
"363",2700699,2704363,"- What are you talking about?- Dracula.","Dracula"
"364",2704448,2707448,"But what's Dracula got to dowith wolves and bats?","Dracula"
"365",2707532,2711620,"- Dracula is our vampire.- But surely, Professor...","Dracula"
"366",2711703,2715118,"A vampire castsno reflection in the glass.","Dracula"
"367",2715159,2718118,"That is why Draculasmashed the mirror.","Dracula"
"368",2718162,2720580,"I don't mean to be rude,","Dracula"
"369",2720666,2723459,"but that's the sort of thing I'd expectone of the patients here to say.","Dracula"
"370",2723542,2728040,"Yes, and that is whatyour English doctors would say,","Dracula"
"371",2728127,2730379,"your police.","Dracula"
"372",2731298,2736044,"The strength of the vampireis that people will not believe in him.","Dracula"
"373",2769141,2772523,"Professor, vampires only existin ghost stories.","Dracula"
"374",2772606,2776017,"A vampire, Mr. Harker,","Dracula"
"375",2776059,2779728,"is a being that lives after its deathby drinking the blood of the living.","Dracula"
"376",2779812,2783319,"It must have blood or it dies.","Dracula"
"377",2783400,2787439,"Its power lasts onlyfrom sunset to sunrise.","Dracula"
"378",2787522,2789191,"During the hours of the day,","Dracula"
"379",2789231,2791736,"it must rest in the earthin which it was buried.","Dracula"
"380",2791819,2793861,"But then, if Dracula were a vampire,","Dracula"
"381",2793943,2797693,"he'd have to return every nightto Transylvania, and that's impossible.","Dracula"
"382",2797733,2801863,"Then he must have broughthis native soil with him, boxes of it.","Dracula"
"383",2801950,2805276,"Boxes of earth large enoughfor him to rest in.","Dracula"
"384",2808074,2810826,"Renfield?What are you doing there?","Dracula"
"385",2810909,2812952,"Come here.","Dracula"
"386",2815405,2818075,"Did you hear what we were saying?","Dracula"
"387",2818158,2821162,"Yes, I heard something.","Dracula"
"388",2821244,2823370,"Enough.","Dracula"
"389",2823458,2827495,"Be guided by what he says.","Dracula"
"390",2827579,2830585,"It's your only hope.","Dracula"
"391",2837587,2839755,"It's her only hope.","Dracula"
"392",2839837,2843214,"I begged you to send me away,but you wouldn't.","Dracula"
"393",2843299,2846045,"Now it's too late.It's happened again.","Dracula"
"394",2846127,2848089,"What's happened?","Dracula"
"395",2851967,2855549,"Take her away from here.Take her away before...","Dracula"
"396",2860055,2864554,"No, no, Master!I wasn't going to say anything!","Dracula"
"397",2864637,2868430,"I told them nothing!I'm loyal to you, Master.","Dracula"
"398",2868515,2871309,"What have you to do with Dracula?","Dracula"
"399",2871391,2874599,"Dracula?","Dracula"
"400",2879976,2883811,"I never even heard the name before.","Dracula"
"401",2883894,2889772,"You will die in torment if you diewith innocent blood on your soul.","Dracula"
"402",2889814,2892316,"Oh, no.","Dracula"
"403",2892401,2896230,"God will not damn a lunatic's soul.","Dracula"

"405",2898857,2901320,"for those of us with weak minds.","Dracula"
"406",2901403,2905816,"Oh, Mr. Harker!Mr. Harker, it's horrible!","Dracula"
"407",2905899,2908192,"Oh, it's horrible! Dr. Seward!","Dracula"
"408",2908279,2911407,"- Miss Mina, out there dead!- Where? Where?","Dracula"
"409",2911489,2915778,"- Out there!","Dracula"
"410",2942630,2945166,"Thank heaven, she's alive.Thank heaven for that.","Dracula"
"411",2945250,2947712,"Alive, yes, but in greater danger,","Dracula"
"412",2947794,2949880,"for she's alreadyunder his influence.","Dracula"
"413",2949965,2952843,"It's horrible, Van Helsing, horrible!Incredible.","Dracula"
"414",2952924,2955545,"Incredible, perhaps,but...","Dracula"

"478",3273684,3274645,"Yes.","Dracula"
"479",3274727,3277607,"And that three boxes of earthwere delivered to him at Carfax Abbey.","Dracula"
"480",3277691,3278650,"Quite.","Dracula"
"481",3278733,3282863,"Knowing a vampire must restby day in his native soil,","Dracula"
"482",3282945,3286827,"I am convincedthat this Dracula is no legend...","Dracula"
"483",3286909,3291833,"but an undead creature whose lifehas been unnaturally prolonged.","Dracula"

"493",3318988,3320908,"Mr. Harker,","Dracula"
"494",3320991,3325746,"I have devoted my lifetimeto the study of many strange things,","Dracula"

"502",3347851,3350147,"Isn't this a strange conversation...","Dracula"
"503",3350231,3352691,"for men who aren't crazy?","Dracula"
"504",3352774,3355736,"Renfield, you're compellingme to put you in a straitjacket.","Dracula"

"515",3392611,3394949,"Not in words,","Dracula"
"516",3395030,3397494,"but by doing them.","Dracula"

"518",3399911,3403208,"By making them happen.","Dracula"
"519",3407546,3411507,"A red mist spread over the lawn,","Dracula"
"520",3411593,3414761,"coming on like a flame of fire.","Dracula"
"521",3414846,3418933,"And then he parted it.","Dracula"

"525",3428571,3431673,"like his, only smaller.","Dracula"
"526",3431759,3434489,"And then he held up his hand,","Dracula"
"527",3434572,3437285,"and they all stopped.","Dracula"
"528",3437328,3440955,"And I thought he seemed to be saying,","Dracula"

"558",3547240,3549660,"If she dies by day.","Dracula"
"559",3549744,3553539,"But I shall seethat she dies by night.","Dracula"

"2408",6476067,6478569,"he encouraged me to open up my heart to him,","Inherit the Wind"
"2409",6479069,6481072,"and then he twisted my words.","Inherit the Wind"
"2410",6481072,6482573,"He tricked me.","Inherit the Wind"
"2411",6482573,6484576,"Why why did he do it","Inherit the Wind"
"2412",6484576,6486077,"I don't know.","Inherit the Wind"
"2413",6486077,6488078,"I don't know why he did it.","Inherit the Wind"
"2414",6491582,6493585,"Maybe it meant too much to him.","Inherit the Wind"
"2415",6493585,6496087,"Maybe he was tired or afraid.","Inherit the Wind"
"2416",6496587,6498088,"I taught my pupils","Inherit the Wind"
"2417",6498088,6500591,"that Matthew Harrison Brady was a great man--","Inherit the Wind"
"2418",6500591,6502092,"next to God, almost.","Inherit the Wind"
"2419",6502092,6504095,"What do you want me to teach them now","Inherit the Wind"
"2420",6504095,6506096,"He's still the same man.","Inherit the Wind"
"2421",6506096,6508099,"No, if he could do such an evil thing,","Inherit the Wind"
"2422",6508099,6510100,"then he must be an evil man,","Inherit the Wind"
"2423",6510100,6511603,"and everything he stands for","Inherit the Wind"
"2424",6511603,6512604,"must be evil, too.","Inherit the Wind"
"2425",6512604,6514104,"Oh, stop it! stop it!","Inherit the Wind"
"2426",6516356,6518859,"Youth can be so pure.","Inherit the Wind"

"2432",6527368,6529871,"You see my husband as a saint,","Inherit the Wind"

"2434",6533875,6535376,"and then you see him as a devil,","Inherit the Wind"
"2435",6535376,6538378,"and everything he says and does must be wrong.","Inherit the Wind"
"2436",6538378,6542516,"Well, my husband's neither a saint nor a devil.","Inherit the Wind"
"2437",6542516,6544519,"He's just a human being...","Inherit the Wind"
"2438",6545520,6547521,"and he makes mistakes.","Inherit the Wind"
"2439",6548021,6549524,"How can you defend him","Inherit the Wind"
"2440",6549524,6551525,"it's not he I'm defending.","Inherit the Wind"
"2441",6551525,6555029,"I'm defending the 40 years I've lived with this man","Inherit the Wind"

"2460",6613087,6614588,"You hurt her.","Inherit the Wind"
"2461",6615590,6616591,"Oh, Matt,","Inherit the Wind"
"2462",6617591,6620595,"you were always a good man.","Inherit the Wind"

"2466",6628101,6630104,"you could have been president 3 times over,","Inherit the Wind"

"2469",6636109,6638613,"You never sacrificed your principles just to win.","Inherit the Wind"
"2470",6639113,6640614,"I didn't mean to hurt her.","Inherit the Wind"
"2471",6640614,6642115,"Sarah...","Inherit the Wind"
"2472",6642115,6643618,"Sarah, a victory here","Inherit the Wind"
"2473",6643618,6644618,"would be a monument to God","Inherit the Wind"

"2477",6650123,6651626,"You can't do it for them, Matt.","Inherit the Wind"
"2478",6652126,6655128,"If you do, it becomes your monument, not theirs,","Inherit the Wind"
"2479",6655630,6660134,"and they'll topple it the minute they find a flaw in it.","Inherit the Wind"
"2480",6660134,6664137,"you mean a flaw in me, don't you, Sarah","Inherit the Wind"
"2481",6668643,6671145,"they turned away from you this afternoon, Matt.","Inherit the Wind"

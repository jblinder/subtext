"45",276280,279063,"These growing feathers,plucked from Caesar's wing,","Julius Caesar"

"74",471060,473132,"Will you go see the order of the course?","Julius Caesar"
"75",473203,475407,"- Not I.- I pray you do.","Julius Caesar"
"76",475475,480014,"I am not gamesome. I do lack some partof that quick spirit that is in Antony.","Julius Caesar"

"78",483475,485963,"Brutus, I do observe you now of late.","Julius Caesar"
"79",486035,490312,"I have not from your eyes that gentlenessand show of love as I was wont to have.","Julius Caesar"
"80",490419,494281,"You bear too stubborn and too strangea hand over your friend that loves you.","Julius Caesar"
"81",494355,496460,"Cassius, be not deceived.If I have veiled my look,","Julius Caesar"
"82",496531,499914,"I turn the trouble of my countenancemerely upon myself.","Julius Caesar"
"83",500019,503281,"Vexed I am of late,with passions of some difference.","Julius Caesar"
"84",503410,504687,"Conceptions only proper to myself,","Julius Caesar"
"85",504755,507689,"which give some soil, perhaps,to my behaviors,","Julius Caesar"
"86",508051,509960,"but let not thereforemy good friends be grieved,","Julius Caesar"
"87",510034,512401,"among which number, Cassius,be you one.","Julius Caesar"
"88",512466,516939,"Nor construe any further my neglectthan that poor Brutus with himself at war","Julius Caesar"
"89",517106,519691,"forgets the shows of love to other men.","Julius Caesar"
"90",522290,525073,"Tell me, good Brutus,can you see your face?","Julius Caesar"
"91",526002,529646,"No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itselfbut by reflection,","Julius Caesar"
"92",529810,531370,"by some other things.","Julius Caesar"
"93",531442,535272,"'Tis just. And it is very much lamented,Brutus, that you have no such mirrors","Julius Caesar"
"94",535346,537418,"as will turn your hidden worthinessinto your eye,","Julius Caesar"
"95",537490,539530,"that you might see your shadow.","Julius Caesar"
"96",539602,541968,"I have heard where manyof the best respect in Rome,","Julius Caesar"
"97",542034,543856,"except immortal Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"98",543922,547784,"speaking of Brutusand groaning underneath this age's yoke,","Julius Caesar"
"99",547858,550443,"have wishedthat noble Brutus had his eyes.","Julius Caesar"
"100",550513,552139,"Into what dangerswould you lead me, Cassius,","Julius Caesar"
"101",552210,554665,"that you would have me seekinto myself for that which is not in me?","Julius Caesar"
"102",554738,556712,"Therefore, good Brutus,be prepared to hear.","Julius Caesar"
"103",556785,559753,"And since you know you cannotsee yourself so well as by reflection,","Julius Caesar"
"104",559825,562411,"I, your glass, will modestlydiscover to yourself","Julius Caesar"
"105",562481,564750,"that of yourselfwhich you yet know not of.","Julius Caesar"
"106",564817,566759,"And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"107",566833,569680,"Were I a common laugher anddid use to stale with ordinary oaths","Julius Caesar"
"108",569745,571655,"my love to every new protester,","Julius Caesar"
"109",571729,574446,"or if you know that I profess myselfin banqueting to all the rout,","Julius Caesar"
"110",574513,576335,"then hold me dangerous.","Julius Caesar"
"111",579729,581671,"What means this shouting?","Julius Caesar"
"112",582513,584815,"I do fear the people choose Caesarfor their king.","Julius Caesar"
"113",584881,586375,"Ay, do you fear it?","Julius Caesar"
"114",586640,588266,"Then must I thinkyou would not have it so?","Julius Caesar"
"115",588337,591436,"I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.","Julius Caesar"
"116",593329,595336,"But what is it you would impart to me?","Julius Caesar"
"117",595409,597002,"If it be aught toward the general good,","Julius Caesar"
"118",597073,598534,"set honor in one eyeand death in the other,","Julius Caesar"
"119",598608,600877,"and I will look on both indifferently.","Julius Caesar"
"120",601296,603630,"For let the gods so speed meas I love the name of honor","Julius Caesar"
"121",603697,604940,"more than I fear death.","Julius Caesar"
"122",605009,609067,"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,as well as I do know your outward favor.","Julius Caesar"
"123",609136,611722,"Well, honor is the subject of my story.","Julius Caesar"
"124",612016,614951,"I cannot tell what youor other men think of this life,","Julius Caesar"
"125",615152,617967,"but, for my single self,I had as lief not be","Julius Caesar"
"126",618032,621480,"as live to be in aweof such a thing as I myself.","Julius Caesar"
"127",623472,625893,"I was born free as Caesar. So were you.","Julius Caesar"
"128",626224,627947,"We both have fed as well,","Julius Caesar"
"129",628015,631244,"and we can both endure the winter's coldas well as he.","Julius Caesar"
"130",631599,633803,"For once, upon a raw and gusty day,","Julius Caesar"
"131",633871,636075,"the troubled Tiber chafing at her shores,","Julius Caesar"
"132",636143,639209,"Caesar said to me, ""Darest thou, Cassius,now leap in with me","Julius Caesar"
"133",639279,642312,"""into this angry floodand swim to yonder points?""","Julius Caesar"
"134",642383,645515,"Upon the word, accoutered as I was,I plunged in and bade him follow,","Julius Caesar"
"135",645584,647177,"so indeed he did.","Julius Caesar"
"136",647407,650636,"The torrent roared,and we did buffet it with lusty sinews,","Julius Caesar"
"137",650767,653996,"throwing it aside and stemming itwith hearts of controversy.","Julius Caesar"
"138",654063,656300,"But ere we could arrivethe point proposed,","Julius Caesar"
"139",656367,659814,"Caesar cried, ""Help me, Cassius, or I sink!""","Julius Caesar"
"140",661007,664302,"And this man is now become a god,","Julius Caesar"
"141",664879,666984,"and Cassius is a wretched creature","Julius Caesar"
"142",667055,671048,"and must bend his bodyif Caesar carelessly but nod on him.","Julius Caesar"
"143",672911,675529,"Caesar! Caesar!","Julius Caesar"
"144",676847,678756,"He had a fever when he was in Spain,","Julius Caesar"
"145",678830,681219,"and when the fit was on him,I did mark how he did shake.","Julius Caesar"
"146",681295,685353,"It is true, this god did shake.His coward lips did from their color fly,","Julius Caesar"
"147",685486,689316,"and that same eye whose bend doth awethe world did lose his luster.","Julius Caesar"
"148",689390,690796,"I did hear him groan.","Julius Caesar"
"149",690862,693033,"Ay, and that tongue of histhat bade the Romans","Julius Caesar"
"150",693102,695207,"mark him and write hisspeeches in their books,","Julius Caesar"
"151",695278,699402,"alas, it cried, ""Give me some drink,Titinius,"" as a sick girl.","Julius Caesar"
"152",700174,703589,"Ye gods! It doth amaze me a manof such a feeble temper","Julius Caesar"
"153",703662,706411,"should so get the startof the majestic world","Julius Caesar"
"154",706606,708329,"and bear the palm alone.","Julius Caesar"
"155",708909,710219,"Caesar! Caesar!","Julius Caesar"
"156",710798,712205,"Another general shout.","Julius Caesar"
"157",712270,716972,"Why, man, he doth bestridethe narrow world like a colossus.","Julius Caesar"
"158",717197,720492,"And we petty men walkunder his huge legs","Julius Caesar"
"159",720558,724332,"and peep aboutto find ourselves dishonorable graves.","Julius Caesar"
"160",725229,728295,"Men at some time are mastersof their fates.","Julius Caesar"
"161",729581,732298,"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,","Julius Caesar"
"162",732525,735143,"but in ourselves, that we are underlings.","Julius Caesar"
"163",735341,736835,"Brutus and Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"164",737069,738695,"What should be in that Caesar?","Julius Caesar"
"165",738765,740870,"Why should that name be soundedmore than yours?","Julius Caesar"
"166",740941,742828,"Write them together,yours is as fair a name.","Julius Caesar"
"167",742893,744715,"Sound them,it doth become the mouth as well.","Julius Caesar"
"168",744781,747050,"Weigh them, it is as heavy.Conjure with them,","Julius Caesar"
"169",747117,749986,"Brutus will start a spiritas soon as Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"170",750061,752843,"Now, in the name of all the gods at once,","Julius Caesar"
"171",752908,755494,"upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,","Julius Caesar"
"172",755565,757834,"that he is grown so great?","Julius Caesar"
"173",758316,760585,"Age, thou art shamed!","Julius Caesar"
"174",760652,764100,"Rome, thou hast lostthe breed of noble bloods.","Julius Caesar"
"175",764940,766947,"When went there by a time,since the great flood,","Julius Caesar"
"176",767020,769671,"but it was famedfor more than for one man?","Julius Caesar"
"177",769740,771715,"When could they say, till now,that talked of Rome,","Julius Caesar"
"178",771788,774658,"that her wide walls encompassedbut one man?","Julius Caesar"
"179",775212,779652,"O you and I have heard our fathers say,there was a Brutus once","Julius Caesar"
"180",780012,781670,"that would have brooked the eternal devil","Julius Caesar"
"181",781740,784522,"to keep his state in Romeas easily as a king.","Julius Caesar"
"182",785484,787873,"That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.","Julius Caesar"
"183",788492,790947,"What you would work me to,I have some aim.","Julius Caesar"
"184",791020,792426,"How I have thought of thisand of these times","Julius Caesar"
"185",792492,794052,"I shall recount hereafter.","Julius Caesar"
"186",794124,795139,"For this present,","Julius Caesar"
"187",795211,798921,"I would not, so with love I mightentreat you, be any further moved.","Julius Caesar"
"188",798987,800197,"What you have said I will consider.","Julius Caesar"
"189",800267,804457,"What you have to say, I will with patiencehear and find a time both meet to hear","Julius Caesar"
"190",804523,806279,"and answer such high things.","Julius Caesar"
"191",807659,810409,"Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this.","Julius Caesar"
"192",811371,813575,"Brutus had rather be a villager","Julius Caesar"
"193",814123,816993,"than to repute himself a son of Romeunder these hard conditions","Julius Caesar"
"194",817066,819455,"as this time is like to lay upon us.","Julius Caesar"
"195",820299,822274,"I am glad that my weak words","Julius Caesar"
"196",822730,826113,"have struck but thus much showof fire from Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"197",831915,833987,"The games are doneand Caesar is returning.","Julius Caesar"
"198",847370,850753,"Look you, Cassius, the angry spotdoth glow on Caesar's brow,","Julius Caesar"
"199",850890,852646,"and all the rest look like a chidden train.","Julius Caesar"
"200",852714,857154,"Casca will, after his sour fashion, tell uswhat hath proceeded worthy note today.","Julius Caesar"
"201",857546,859400,"Calpurnia's cheek is pale,","Julius Caesar"
"202",859913,862630,"and Cicero looks with such ferretand such fiery eyes","Julius Caesar"
"203",862697,866276,"as we have seen him in the Capitol beingcrossed in conference by some senators.","Julius Caesar"
"204",866346,868866,"Casca will tell us what the matter is.","Julius Caesar"
"205",879881,883656,"Antonius, let me have men about methat are fat,","Julius Caesar"
"206",883721,886307,"sleek-headed men,and such as sleep a-nights.","Julius Caesar"
"207",886857,891080,"Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.He thinks too much.","Julius Caesar"
"208",891785,893574,"Such men are dangerous.","Julius Caesar"
"209",893929,896646,"Fear him not, Caesar. He is not dangerous.","Julius Caesar"
"210",899049,900772,"Would he were fatter.","Julius Caesar"
"211",901225,902687,"But I fear him not.","Julius Caesar"
"212",902760,904615,"Yet if my name were liable to fear,","Julius Caesar"
"213",904680,908193,"I do not know the man I should avoidso soon as that spare Cassius.","Julius Caesar"
"214",908520,909862,"He reads much.","Julius Caesar"
"215",910248,914045,"He is a great observer, and he looksquite through the deeds of men.","Julius Caesar"
"216",914888,917823,"He loves no plays as thou dost, Antony.","Julius Caesar"
"217",917961,919717,"He hears no music.","Julius Caesar"
"218",920360,922368,"Seldom he smiles,and smiles in such a sort","Julius Caesar"
"219",922440,924295,"as if he mocked himself,and scorned his spirit","Julius Caesar"
"220",924360,926749,"that could be moved to smile at anything.","Julius Caesar"
"221",927176,929380,"Such men as he be never at heart's ease","Julius Caesar"
"222",929448,932263,"whilst they beholda greater than themselves,","Julius Caesar"
"223",932328,934848,"and therefore are they very dangerous.","Julius Caesar"
"224",937256,939842,"I rather tell thee what is to befeared than what I fear,","Julius Caesar"
"225",939912,942050,"for always I am Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"226",944168,947332,"Come on my right hand,for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly","Julius Caesar"
"227",947400,949309,"what thou think'st of him.","Julius Caesar"
"228",973255,975360,"- Would you speak with me?- Ay, Casca.","Julius Caesar"
"229",975431,978530,"Tell us what hath chanced today,that Caesar looks so sad.","Julius Caesar"
"230",978599,981249,"Why, you were with him, were you not?","Julius Caesar"
"231",981639,984257,"I should not then ask Cascawhat had chanced.","Julius Caesar"
"232",985670,987874,"Why, there was a crown offered him,and, being offered him,","Julius Caesar"
"233",987942,990463,"he put it bywith the back of his hand, thus,","Julius Caesar"
"234",990534,992706,"and then the people fell a-shouting.","Julius Caesar"
"235",992839,994465,"What was the second noise for?","Julius Caesar"
"236",994535,996836,"- Why, for that too.- They shouted thrice.","Julius Caesar"
"237",996902,999870,"- What was the last cry for?- Why, for that too.","Julius Caesar"
"238",1000167,1003200,"- Was the crown offered him thrice?- Ay, marry, it was,","Julius Caesar"
"239",1003270,1006565,"and he put it by thrice,every time gentler than other,","Julius Caesar"
"240",1006854,1009342,"and with every putting bymine honest neighbors shouted.","Julius Caesar"
"241",1009415,1012284,"- Who offered him the crown?- Why, Antony.","Julius Caesar"
"242",1014470,1016324,"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.","Julius Caesar"
"243",1016390,1018277,"I can as well be hangedas tell the manner of it.","Julius Caesar"
"244",1018342,1020895,"It was mere foolery. I did not mark it.","Julius Caesar"
"245",1020966,1022941,"I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown.","Julius Caesar"
"246",1023014,1026112,"Yet it was not a crown neither,it was one of those coronets.","Julius Caesar"
"247",1026182,1028932,"And as I told you, he put it by once,but, for all that, to my thinking,","Julius Caesar"
"248",1028998,1030372,"he would fain have had it.","Julius Caesar"
"249",1030437,1032958,"Then he offered it to him again,then he put it by again,","Julius Caesar"
"250",1033029,1036128,"but, to my thinking, he was very loathto lay his fingers off it.","Julius Caesar"
"251",1036197,1039546,"Then he offered it a third time.He put it a third time by.","Julius Caesar"
"252",1039622,1042655,"And still as he refused it, the rabblementhooted and clapped their chapped hands","Julius Caesar"
"253",1042725,1044547,"and threw up their sweaty nightcaps","Julius Caesar"
"254",1044613,1047712,"and uttered such a deal of stinking breathbecause Caesar refused the crown,","Julius Caesar"
"255",1047781,1050945,"that it had almost choked Caesarfor he swounded and fell down at it.","Julius Caesar"
"256",1051013,1053435,"And for mine own part I durst not laugh,for fear of opening my lips","Julius Caesar"
"257",1053509,1055135,"and receiving the bad air.","Julius Caesar"
"258",1055269,1057603,"What? Did Caesar swoon?","Julius Caesar"
"259",1057669,1060800,"He fell down and foamed at the mouthand was speechless.","Julius Caesar"
"260",1062597,1065117,"'Tis very like he hath the falling sickness.","Julius Caesar"
"261",1067685,1069594,"No, Caesar hath it not,","Julius Caesar"
"262",1069669,1073760,"but you and I and honest Casca,we have the falling sickness.","Julius Caesar"
"263",1074148,1078142,"I know not what you mean by that,but I am sure Caesar fell down.","Julius Caesar"
"264",1078244,1080132,"What said he when he came unto himself?","Julius Caesar"
"265",1080197,1081626,"When he came to himself again,","Julius Caesar"
"266",1081701,1084035,"he said if he had doneor said anything amiss,","Julius Caesar"
"267",1084100,1087100,"he desired their worshipsto think it was his infirmity.","Julius Caesar"
"268",1087492,1090242,"Three or four wenches where I stoodcried, ""Alas, good soul,""","Julius Caesar"
"269",1090308,1092609,"and forgave him with all their hearts.","Julius Caesar"
"270",1092708,1094269,"There's no heed to be taken of them.","Julius Caesar"
"271",1094340,1097569,"If Caesar had stabbed their mothers,they would have done no less.","Julius Caesar"
"272",1097636,1100286,"And after that he came, thus sad, away?","Julius Caesar"
"273",1100356,1101633,"Ay.","Julius Caesar"
"274",1101700,1103074,"Did Cicero say anything?","Julius Caesar"
"275",1103139,1105311,"- Ay, he spoke Greek.- To what effect?","Julius Caesar"
"276",1105508,1108028,"Nay, an I tell you that,I'll never look you in the face again,","Julius Caesar"
"277",1108099,1110914,"but those that understood him smiledat one another and shook their heads,","Julius Caesar"
"278",1110979,1113151,"but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.","Julius Caesar"
"279",1113220,1115129,"I could tell you more news, too.","Julius Caesar"
"280",1115427,1119770,"Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarvesoff Caesar's images, are put to silence.","Julius Caesar"
"281",1121060,1122489,"Fare you well.","Julius Caesar"
"282",1123075,1126207,"There was more foolery yet,if I could remember it.","Julius Caesar"
"283",1129475,1131711,"Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?","Julius Caesar"
"284",1132292,1134015,"No, I am promised forth.","Julius Caesar"
"285",1135587,1137791,"Will you dine with me tomorrow?","Julius Caesar"
"286",1138787,1142943,"Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold,and your dinner worth the eating.","Julius Caesar"
"287",1143011,1145018,"Good. I will expect you.","Julius Caesar"
"288",1145763,1147585,"Do so. Farewell, both.","Julius Caesar"
"289",1150915,1153216,"What a blunt fellow is this grown to be.","Julius Caesar"
"290",1153283,1155006,"He was quick metalwhen he went to school.","Julius Caesar"
"291",1155075,1158206,"So is he now in executionof any bold or noble enterprise.","Julius Caesar"
"292",1159074,1161496,"This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,","Julius Caesar"
"293",1161570,1165400,"which gives men stomach to digesthis words with better appetite.","Julius Caesar"
"294",1166339,1167746,"And so it is.","Julius Caesar"
"295",1168098,1170302,"For this time I will leave you.","Julius Caesar"
"296",1170370,1172825,"Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,I will come home to you.","Julius Caesar"
"297",1172898,1176346,"Or, if you will, come home to me,and I will wait for you.","Julius Caesar"
"298",1176482,1179962,"I will do so. Till then, think of the world.","Julius Caesar"
"299",1185474,1187165,"Well, Brutus, thou art noble,","Julius Caesar"
"300",1187234,1190943,"yet I see thy honorable metalmay be wrought from that it is disposed.","Julius Caesar"
"301",1191906,1195135,"Therefore, it is meet that noble mindskeep ever with their likes,","Julius Caesar"
"302",1195201,1197852,"for who so firm that cannot be seduced?","Julius Caesar"
"303",1198978,1202207,"Caesar doth bear me hard,yet he loves Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"304",1203105,1207361,"If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,he should not humor me.","Julius Caesar"
"305",1208322,1211355,"I will this night, in several hands,","Julius Caesar"
"306",1211425,1214720,"in at his windows throw,as if they came from several citizens,","Julius Caesar"
"307",1214785,1218909,"writings all tending to the great opinionthat Rome holds of his name,","Julius Caesar"
"308",1218977,1223734,"wherein obscurely Caesar's ambitionshall be glanced at.","Julius Caesar"
"309",1224385,1227036,"And after this let Caesar seat him sure,","Julius Caesar"
"310",1227232,1228988,"for we will shake him,","Julius Caesar"
"311",1229056,1231609,"or worse days endure.","Julius Caesar"
"312",1292511,1294420,"Good even, Casca.","Julius Caesar"
"313",1294655,1297077,"Why are you breathless?And why stare you so?","Julius Caesar"
"314",1297215,1301176,"Are not you moved, when all the swayof earth shakes like a thing unfirm?","Julius Caesar"
"315",1301247,1302589,"O Cicero, I have seen tempests,","Julius Caesar"
"316",1302655,1304924,"when the scolding winds have rivedthe knotty oaks,","Julius Caesar"
"317",1304991,1307325,"and I have seen the ambitiousocean swell and rage and foam,","Julius Caesar"
"318",1307391,1309431,"to be exalted with the threatening clouds.","Julius Caesar"
"319",1309503,1313496,"But never till tonight, never till now,did I go through a tempest dropping fire.","Julius Caesar"
"320",1313567,1315356,"Either there is a civil strife in heaven,","Julius Caesar"
"321",1315423,1319219,"or else the world, too saucy with the gods,incenses them to send destruction.","Julius Caesar"
"322",1319294,1321563,"Why, saw you anything more wonderful?","Julius Caesar"
"323",1321630,1323867,"A common slave,you know him well by sight,","Julius Caesar"
"324",1323934,1325046,"held up his left hand,","Julius Caesar"
"325",1325118,1328086,"which did flame and burnlike 20 torches joined.","Julius Caesar"
"326",1328158,1329336,"And there were drawn upon a heap","Julius Caesar"
"327",1329406,1332024,"100 ghastly women,transformed with their fear,","Julius Caesar"
"328",1332094,1335542,"who swore they saw men all in firewalk up and down the streets.","Julius Caesar"
"329",1335614,1338778,"And yesterday the bird of night did sit,even at noonday, upon the marketplace,","Julius Caesar"
"330",1338846,1340023,"hooting and shrieking.","Julius Caesar"
"331",1340094,1342233,"When these prodigiesdo so conjointly meet,","Julius Caesar"
"332",1342302,1345237,"let not men say, ""These are their reasons,they are natural.""","Julius Caesar"
"333",1345310,1349499,"For, I believe, they are portentous thingsunto the climate that they point upon.","Julius Caesar"
"334",1350365,1352853,"Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?","Julius Caesar"
"335",1356637,1361110,"He doth, for he did bid Antonius send wordto you he would be there tomorrow.","Julius Caesar"
"336",1361214,1362970,"Good night then, Casca.","Julius Caesar"
"337",1363582,1366135,"This disturbed sky is not to walk in.","Julius Caesar"
"338",1366622,1368083,"Farewell, Cicero.","Julius Caesar"
"339",1388252,1390521,"- Who's there?- A Roman.","Julius Caesar"
"340",1390589,1392247,"Casca, by your voice.","Julius Caesar"
"341",1392829,1396342,"- Cassius, what night is this?- A very pleasing night to honest men.","Julius Caesar"
"342",1396413,1397874,"Who ever knew the heavens menace so?","Julius Caesar"
"343",1397949,1400535,"Those that have knownthe earth so full of faults.","Julius Caesar"
"344",1400605,1402230,"You are dull, Casca,","Julius Caesar"
"345",1402300,1404439,"and those sparks of lifethat should be in a Roman","Julius Caesar"
"346",1404509,1406745,"you do want, or else you use not.","Julius Caesar"
"347",1406845,1410140,"You look pale and gaze and put on fearand cast yourself in wonder,","Julius Caesar"
"348",1410204,1413019,"to see the strange impatienceof the heavens.","Julius Caesar"
"349",1413757,1418012,"Now could I, Casca, name to theea man most like this dreadful night","Julius Caesar"
"350",1418524,1421688,"that thunders, lightens,opens graves and roars.","Julius Caesar"
"351",1421756,1424276,"A man no mightier than thyself or me.","Julius Caesar"
"352",1424348,1426039,"'Tis Caesar that you mean,is it not, Cassius?","Julius Caesar"
"353",1426108,1427056,"Let it be who it is.","Julius Caesar"
"354",1427132,1430481,"Indeed, they say the senators tomorrowmean to establish Caesar as a king.","Julius Caesar"
"355",1430556,1432595,"And he shall wear his crownby sea and land,","Julius Caesar"
"356",1432667,1434577,"in every place save here in Italy.","Julius Caesar"
"357",1434652,1436953,"I know where I will wear this dagger, then.","Julius Caesar"
"358",1437019,1439703,"Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.","Julius Caesar"
"359",1439836,1442967,"That part of tyranny that I do bearI can shake off at pleasure.","Julius Caesar"
"360",1443035,1445457,"So can I, so every bondmanin his own hand","Julius Caesar"
"361",1445532,1448150,"bears the power to cancel his captivity.","Julius Caesar"
"362",1448955,1451322,"And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?","Julius Caesar"
"363",1451835,1454137,"Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf","Julius Caesar"
"364",1454203,1456592,"but that he knowsthe Romans are but sheep.","Julius Caesar"
"365",1457147,1459798,"He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.","Julius Caesar"
"366",1460059,1463768,"They that with haste will makea mighty fire begin it with weak straws.","Julius Caesar"
"367",1464059,1467671,"What trash is Rome,what rubbish and what offal,","Julius Caesar"
"368",1467739,1470357,"that it serves for the basematter to illuminate","Julius Caesar"
"369",1470427,1472728,"so vile a thing as Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"370",1474619,1476757,"But, O grief, where hast thou led me?","Julius Caesar"
"371",1477019,1479921,"I, per chance, speak thisbefore a willing bondman.","Julius Caesar"
"372",1481563,1485108,"You speak to Casca, and to such a manthat is no fleering tell-tale.","Julius Caesar"
"373",1485243,1486617,"Here's my hand.","Julius Caesar"
"374",1486682,1489235,"And I will set this foot of mineas far as who goes farthest.","Julius Caesar"
"375",1489306,1491029,"There's a bargain made!","Julius Caesar"
"376",1492090,1493912,"Stand close awhile.","Julius Caesar"
"377",1495867,1498801,"'Tis Cinna. I do know him by his gait.He is a friend.","Julius Caesar"
"378",1501082,1503896,"- Cinna, where haste you so?- To find out you.","Julius Caesar"
"379",1503994,1505336,"Who's that? Metellus Cimber?","Julius Caesar"
"380",1505402,1507573,"No, it is Casca,one incorporate to our attempts.","Julius Caesar"
"381",1507642,1509911,"- Am I not stayed for, Cinna?- Yes, you are.","Julius Caesar"
"382",1509978,1512792,"Cassius, if you could but win the nobleBrutus to our party...","Julius Caesar"
"383",1512858,1515792,"Be you content.Good Cinna, take this paper,","Julius Caesar"
"384",1515866,1518615,"and look you lay it in the praetor'schair, where Brutus may but find it,","Julius Caesar"
"385",1518682,1522610,"and throw this in at his window,set this up in wax upon old Brutus' statue.","Julius Caesar"
"386",1522682,1525529,"All this done, repair to Pompey's porch,where you shall find us.","Julius Caesar"
"387",1525593,1527317,"Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?","Julius Caesar"
"388",1527386,1530801,"All but Metellus Cimber,and he's gone to seek you at your house.","Julius Caesar"
"389",1531545,1534960,"Now, Casca, you and I will yet ere dayseek Brutus at his house.","Julius Caesar"
"390",1535193,1536982,"Three parts of him is ours already,","Julius Caesar"
"391",1537049,1540594,"and the man entireupon the next encounter yields him ours.","Julius Caesar"
"392",1580024,1583985,"I cannot, by the progress of the stars,give guess how near to day.","Julius Caesar"
"393",1590807,1592018,"Lucius.","Julius Caesar"
"394",1594104,1596438,"Awake, I say. Lucius.","Julius Caesar"
"395",1601240,1604207,"I would it were my faultto sleep so soundly.","Julius Caesar"
"396",1612311,1613740,"Called you, my lord?","Julius Caesar"
"397",1613815,1617427,"Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.When it is lighted, come and call me here.","Julius Caesar"
"398",1617495,1618989,"I will, my lord.","Julius Caesar"
"399",1632599,1634900,"It must be by his death,","Julius Caesar"
"400",1636182,1640754,"and, for my part, I know no personal causeto spurn at him but for the general.","Julius Caesar"
"401",1641686,1643508,"He would be crowned.","Julius Caesar"
"402",1644534,1647382,"How that might change his nature,there's the question.","Julius Caesar"
"403",1647446,1649835,"For it is the bright daythat brings forth the adder,","Julius Caesar"
"404",1649911,1651918,"and that craves wary walking.","Julius Caesar"
"405",1652214,1654385,"Crown him. That.","Julius Caesar"
"406",1655286,1659476,"And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,that at his will he may do danger with.","Julius Caesar"
"407",1660886,1664846,"The abuse of greatness iswhen it disjoins remorse from power.","Julius Caesar"
"408",1666006,1667348,"And, to speak truth of Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"409",1667414,1670709,"I have not known when his affectionsswayed more than his reason.","Julius Caesar"
"410",1670774,1675313,"But 'tis a common proofthat lowliness is young ambition's ladder,","Julius Caesar"
"411",1676118,1678125,"whereto the climber upward turnshis face,","Julius Caesar"
"412",1678198,1680686,"but when he once attainsthe upmost round,","Julius Caesar"
"413",1680757,1683921,"he then unto the ladder turns his back,looks in the clouds,","Julius Caesar"
"414",1684758,1687856,"scorning the base degreesby which he did ascend.","Julius Caesar"
"415",1688789,1690218,"So Caesar may.","Julius Caesar"
"416",1692085,1693908,"Then lest he may, prevent.","Julius Caesar"
"417",1694934,1699025,"And, since the quarrel will bear no colorfor the thing he is, fashion it thus,","Julius Caesar"
"418",1699285,1703114,"that what he is, augmented,would run to these and these extremities.","Julius Caesar"
"419",1704277,1706928,"And therefore think him as a serpent's egg","Julius Caesar"
"420",1707669,1710669,"which, hatched, would, as his kind,grow mischievous,","Julius Caesar"
"421",1711764,1714993,"and kill him in the shell.","Julius Caesar"
"422",1720021,1722192,"The taper burneth in your closet, sir.","Julius Caesar"
"423",1722261,1725741,"Searching the window for a flint,I found this paper thus sealed up,","Julius Caesar"
"424",1725812,1728594,"and I am sure it did not lie therewhen I went to bed.","Julius Caesar"
"425",1728660,1730449,"Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?","Julius Caesar"
"426",1730516,1731498,"I know not, sir.","Julius Caesar"

"437",1766964,1768305,"What, Rome?","Julius Caesar"
"438",1769044,1771793,"My ancestors did from the streets of Romethe Tarquin drive,","Julius Caesar"

"445",1788659,1790961,"Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.","Julius Caesar"
"446",1791795,1792940,"'Tis good.","Julius Caesar"
"447",1797267,1799372,"Go to the gate. Somebody knocks.","Julius Caesar"
"448",1803218,1807080,"Since Cassius first did whet meagainst Caesar, I have not slept.","Julius Caesar"
"449",1808659,1810863,"Between the acting of a dreadful thingand the first motion,","Julius Caesar"
"450",1810931,1813320,"all the interim is like a phantasma,","Julius Caesar"
"451",1813971,1815378,"or a hideous dream.","Julius Caesar"
"452",1816339,1819655,"The genius and the mortal instrumentsare then in council,","Julius Caesar"
"453",1820083,1822090,"and the state of man,","Julius Caesar"
"454",1822162,1825991,"like to a little kingdom,suffers then the nature of an insurrection.","Julius Caesar"
"455",1831986,1833644,"I fear we are too bold upon your rest.","Julius Caesar"
"456",1833714,1835470,"Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?","Julius Caesar"
"457",1835538,1837927,"I have been up this hour, awake all night.","Julius Caesar"
"458",1838514,1840336,"Know I these menthat come along with you?","Julius Caesar"
"459",1840401,1842987,"Yes, every one of them.And no man here but honors you.","Julius Caesar"
"460",1843058,1845229,"And every one doth wishyou had but that opinion of yourself","Julius Caesar"
"461",1845298,1847403,"which every noble Roman bears of you.","Julius Caesar"
"462",1847474,1848816,"This is Trebonius.","Julius Caesar"
"463",1849041,1850797,"- He is welcome hither.- This, Decius Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"464",1850865,1853004,"- He is welcome, too.- This, Casca. This, Cinna.","Julius Caesar"
"465",1853074,1855791,"- And this, Metellus Cimber.- They are all welcome.","Julius Caesar"
"466",1856369,1858508,"What watchful caresdo interpose themselves","Julius Caesar"
"467",1858578,1860520,"betwixt your eyes and the night?","Julius Caesar"
"468",1861137,1862959,"Shall I entreat a word?","Julius Caesar"
"469",1870513,1873547,"Here lies the east.Doth not the day break here?","Julius Caesar"
"470",1873937,1876523,"- No.- O pardon, sir, it doth.","Julius Caesar"
"471",1877169,1880333,"Yon gray lines that fret the cloudsare messengers of day.","Julius Caesar"
"472",1880401,1882637,"You shall confessthat you are both deceived.","Julius Caesar"
"473",1882704,1886000,"Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises.","Julius Caesar"
"474",1892977,1896457,"- Give me your hands all over, one by one.- And let us swear our resolution.","Julius Caesar"
"475",1896529,1897958,"No, not an oath.","Julius Caesar"
"476",1898449,1901994,"If not the face of men, the sufferanceof our souls, the time's abuse,","Julius Caesar"
"477",1902064,1904137,"if these be motives weak,break off betimes,","Julius Caesar"
"478",1904209,1906063,"and every man hence to his idle bed.","Julius Caesar"
"479",1906128,1908103,"So let high-sighted tyranny range on","Julius Caesar"
"480",1908176,1910031,"till each man drop by lottery.","Julius Caesar"
"481",1910352,1913668,"What need we any spur but our own causeto prick us to redress?","Julius Caesar"
"482",1913967,1916302,"What other bond than secret Romansthat have spoke the word","Julius Caesar"
"483",1916368,1918026,"and will not palter?","Julius Caesar"
"484",1918256,1920361,"What other oaththan honesty to honesty engaged,","Julius Caesar"
"485",1920432,1922799,"that this shall be or we will fall for it?","Julius Caesar"
"486",1923088,1925509,"Swear priests and cowardsand men cautelous,","Julius Caesar"
"487",1926095,1929510,"old feeble carrions and such sufferingsouls that welcome wrongs.","Julius Caesar"
"488",1929839,1933003,"Unto bad causes swearsuch creatures as men doubt,","Julius Caesar"
"489",1933391,1936042,"but do not stain the even virtueof our enterprise,","Julius Caesar"
"490",1936111,1938380,"nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirit,","Julius Caesar"
"491",1938447,1941764,"to think that or our causeor our performance did need an oath.","Julius Caesar"
"492",1942415,1944749,"But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?","Julius Caesar"
"493",1944847,1946635,"I think he will stand very strong with us.","Julius Caesar"
"494",1946704,1950282,"O let us have him, for his silver hairswill purchase us a good opinion","Julius Caesar"
"495",1950351,1952423,"and buy men's voicesto commend our deeds.","Julius Caesar"
"496",1952495,1954251,"Let us not leave him out.","Julius Caesar"
"497",1954351,1957733,"O name him not. For he will never followanything that other men begin.","Julius Caesar"
"498",1957807,1960196,"- Then leave him out.- Indeed, he is not fit.","Julius Caesar"
"499",1962351,1964839,"Shall no man else be touchedbut only Caesar?","Julius Caesar"
"500",1965231,1966889,"Decius, well urged.","Julius Caesar"
"501",1967182,1969833,"I think it is not meet Mark Antony,so well beloved of Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"502",1969902,1971429,"should outlive Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"503",1971599,1973387,"We shall find in him a shrewd contriver,","Julius Caesar"
"504",1973454,1975277,"and, you know, his means,if he improve them,","Julius Caesar"
"505",1975343,1977710,"may well stretch so far as to annoy us all,","Julius Caesar"
"506",1977775,1980458,"which to prevent,let Antony and Caesar fall together.","Julius Caesar"
"507",1980526,1983112,"Our course will seem too bloody,Caius Cassius,","Julius Caesar"
"508",1983310,1985285,"to cut the head offand then hack the limbs,","Julius Caesar"
"509",1985358,1987496,"like wrath in death and envy afterwards.","Julius Caesar"
"510",1987566,1989835,"For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"511",1989902,1992488,"Let us be sacrificers,but not butchers, Caius.","Julius Caesar"
"512",1993646,1995784,"We all stand upagainst the spirit of Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"513",1995854,1998276,"And in the spirit of men there is no blood.","Julius Caesar"
"514",1998574,2000167,"O that we then could comeby Caesar's spirit,","Julius Caesar"
"515",2000238,2003499,"and not dismember Caesar.But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.","Julius Caesar"
"516",2003982,2007113,"And, gentle friends,let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.","Julius Caesar"
"517",2007182,2011492,"Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.","Julius Caesar"
"518",2011630,2013605,"And for Mark Antony, think not of him,","Julius Caesar"
"519",2013677,2016645,"for he can do no more than Caesar's armwhen Caesar's head is off.","Julius Caesar"
"520",2016718,2017895,"Yet I do fear him,","Julius Caesar"
"521",2017965,2021478,"- for the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar.- Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.","Julius Caesar"
"522",2021549,2024331,"If he love Caesar,all that he can do is to himself.","Julius Caesar"
"523",2024525,2026467,"Take thought and die for Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"524",2026734,2029068,"And that were much he should,for he is given to sports,","Julius Caesar"
"525",2029133,2030627,"to wildness and much company.","Julius Caesar"
"526",2030701,2032970,"There is no fear in him. Let him not die,","Julius Caesar"
"527",2033037,2035557,"for he will live and laugh at this hereafter.","Julius Caesar"
"528",2035981,2037891,"'Tis time to part.The morning comes upon us.","Julius Caesar"
"529",2037965,2039623,"We'll leave you, Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"530",2042381,2045196,"But it is doubtful yet whether Caesarwill come forth today or no,","Julius Caesar"
"531",2045261,2047628,"for he is superstitious grown of late.","Julius Caesar"
"532",2047693,2050726,"It may be, these apparent prodigies,the unaccustomed terror of the night,","Julius Caesar"
"533",2050796,2053731,"and the persuasion of his augurers,may hold him from the Capitol today.","Julius Caesar"
"534",2053805,2058060,"Never fear that.If he be so resolved, I can oversway him,","Julius Caesar"
"535",2058253,2061897,"for he loves to hear that unicorns may bebetrayed with trees,","Julius Caesar"
"536",2061964,2064964,"lions with toils and men with flatterers.","Julius Caesar"
"537",2065100,2067588,"But when I tell him he hates flatterers,","Julius Caesar"
"538",2067661,2070410,"he says he does,being then most flattered.","Julius Caesar"
"539",2070508,2072929,"Let me work,and I will bring him to the Capitol.","Julius Caesar"
"540",2073004,2076070,"Nay, we will all of us be thereto fetch him.","Julius Caesar"
"541",2077932,2080135,"By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?","Julius Caesar"
"542",2080204,2082342,"Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.","Julius Caesar"
"543",2082412,2084746,"Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,","Julius Caesar"
"544",2084812,2086437,"who rated himfor speaking well of Pompey.","Julius Caesar"
"545",2086508,2088068,"I wonder none of you have thought of him.","Julius Caesar"
"546",2088139,2089765,"Now, good Metellus, go along by him.","Julius Caesar"
"547",2089836,2091494,"He loves me well,and I have given him reasons.","Julius Caesar"
"548",2091563,2093800,"Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.","Julius Caesar"
"549",2093868,2097283,"And friends, disperse yourselves,but all remember what you have said,","Julius Caesar"
"550",2097899,2099907,"and show yourselves true Romans.","Julius Caesar"
"551",2099979,2101670,"Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.","Julius Caesar"
"552",2101739,2103943,"Let not our looks put on our purposes.","Julius Caesar"
"553",2104588,2105994,"And so, good morrow to you, everyone.","Julius Caesar"
"554",2116843,2119712,"Portia, what mean you?Wherefore rise you now?","Julius Caesar"
"555",2120555,2122922,"It is not for your health thusto commit your weak condition","Julius Caesar"
"556",2122987,2125987,"- to the raw cold morning.- Nor for yours neither.","Julius Caesar"
"557",2126763,2129184,"You've ungently, Brutus,stole from my bed,","Julius Caesar"
"558",2130059,2133026,"and yesternight at supperyou suddenly arose and walked about","Julius Caesar"
"559",2133098,2135432,"musing and sighingwith your arms across.","Julius Caesar"
"560",2135530,2136992,"And when I asked youwhat the matter was,","Julius Caesar"
"561",2137067,2139336,"you stared upon me with ungentle looks.","Julius Caesar"
"562",2140138,2141829,"I urged you further,","Julius Caesar"
"563",2142090,2145439,"and then you scratched your head andtoo impatiently stamped with your foot.","Julius Caesar"
"564",2145515,2147337,"Yet I insisted, yet you answered not,","Julius Caesar"
"565",2147402,2151111,"but, with an angry wafture of your hand,gave sign for me to leave you.","Julius Caesar"
"566",2151370,2152548,"So I did,","Julius Caesar"
"567",2152938,2156583,"fearing to strengthen that impatiencewhich seemed too much enkindled,","Julius Caesar"
"568",2156778,2159233,"and withal hoping it wasbut an effect of humor,","Julius Caesar"
"569",2159306,2161728,"which sometime hath his hourwith every man.","Julius Caesar"
"570",2162857,2165989,"It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep.","Julius Caesar"
"571",2166953,2168514,"And, could it workso much upon your shape","Julius Caesar"
"572",2168586,2170440,"as it hath much prevailedon your condition,","Julius Caesar"
"573",2170506,2172480,"I should not know you, Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"574",2173898,2177313,"Dear my lord, make me acquaintedwith your cause of grief.","Julius Caesar"
"575",2177386,2179774,"I am not well in health, and that is all.","Julius Caesar"
"576",2180393,2182695,"Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,","Julius Caesar"
"577",2182761,2185663,"he would embrace the meansto come by it.","Julius Caesar"
"578",2185738,2187264,"Why, so I do.","Julius Caesar"
"579",2188841,2190630,"Good Portia, go to bed.","Julius Caesar"
"580",2192106,2193415,"Is Brutus sick?","Julius Caesar"
"581",2193481,2195423,"And is it physical to walk unbraced","Julius Caesar"
"582",2195497,2198147,"and suck up the humorsof the dank morning?","Julius Caesar"
"583",2198281,2199557,"What, is Brutus sick?","Julius Caesar"
"584",2199625,2201535,"And will he stealout of his wholesome bed","Julius Caesar"
"585",2201608,2205121,"to dare the vile contagion of the night,and add unto his sickness?","Julius Caesar"
"586",2206249,2207558,"No, my Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"587",2207624,2210374,"You have some sick offensewithin your mind,","Julius Caesar"
"588",2210921,2214237,"which, by the right and virtue of my place,I ought to know of.","Julius Caesar"
"589",2214696,2216965,"And, upon my knees, I charm you","Julius Caesar"
"590",2217032,2218854,"by my once-commended beauty,","Julius Caesar"
"591",2218952,2220992,"by all your vows of loveand that great vow","Julius Caesar"
"592",2221064,2223136,"which did incorporate and make us one,","Julius Caesar"
"593",2223208,2226885,"that you unfold to me, yourself, your half,why you are heavy,","Julius Caesar"
"594",2228168,2230852,"and what men tonighthave had resort to you,","Julius Caesar"
"595",2231016,2235206,"for here have been some six or seven whodid hide their faces even from darkness.","Julius Caesar"
"596",2235720,2237542,"Kneel not, gentle Portia.","Julius Caesar"
"597",2237608,2240128,"I should not needif you were gentle Brutus.","Julius Caesar"
"598",2241064,2243552,"Within the bond of marriage,tell me, Brutus,","Julius Caesar"
"599",2243847,2247109,"is it excepted I should know no secretsthat appertain to you?","Julius Caesar"
"600",2247591,2250887,"Am I yourself but, as it were,in sort or limitation,","Julius Caesar"
"601",2251496,2253667,"to keep with you at meals,comfort your bed,","Julius Caesar"
"602",2253736,2255263,"and talk to you sometimes.","Julius Caesar"
"603",2256264,2258981,"Dwell I but in the suburbsof your good pleasure?","Julius Caesar"
"604",2259719,2263134,"If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot,not his wife.","Julius Caesar"
"605",2266503,2268805,"You are my true and honorable wife,","Julius Caesar"
"606",2269447,2272676,"as dear to me as are the ruddy dropsthat visit my sad heart.","Julius Caesar"
"607",2273191,2276126,"If this were true,then should I know this secret.","Julius Caesar"
"608",2276871,2278245,"I grant I am a woman,","Julius Caesar"
"609",2278311,2280994,"but withal a womanthat Lord Brutus took to wife.","Julius Caesar"
"610",2281063,2284740,"I grant I am a woman, but withal a womanwell-reputed, Cato's daughter.","Julius Caesar"
"611",2285703,2290176,"Think you I am no stronger than my sex,being so fathered and so husbanded?","Julius Caesar"
"612",2290630,2293597,"Tell me your counsels.I will not disclose them.","Julius Caesar"
"613",2296423,2298016,"Portia, go in a while.","Julius Caesar"
"614",2298087,2301348,"And by and by thy bosom shall partakethe secrets of my heart.","Julius Caesar"
"615",2301479,2303486,"All my engagementsI will construe to thee,","Julius Caesar"
"616",2303559,2305926,"all the charactery of my sad brows.","Julius Caesar"
"617",2314182,2316931,"Here is a sick manthat would speak with you.","Julius Caesar"
"618",2319558,2321980,"Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.","Julius Caesar"
"619",2322118,2323132,"Boy, stand aside.","Julius Caesar"
"620",2323206,2325628,"Vouchsafe good morrowfrom a feeble tongue.","Julius Caesar"
"621",2325701,2329084,"What a time have you chose out,brave Caius, to wear a kerchief.","Julius Caesar"
"622",2329285,2331936,"- Would you were not sick.- I am not sick,","Julius Caesar"
"623",2332006,2335202,"if Brutus have in hand any exploitworthy the name of honor.","Julius Caesar"
"624",2335270,2337058,"Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,","Julius Caesar"
"625",2337125,2339013,"had you a healthful ear to hear of it.","Julius Caesar"
"626",2339078,2342689,"By all the gods that Romans bow before,I here discard my sickness.","Julius Caesar"
"627",2342822,2345724,"Bid me run,and I will strive with things impossible.","Julius Caesar"
"628",2345798,2347586,"Yea, get the better of them.","Julius Caesar"
"629",2347653,2350304,"For it sufficeth that Brutus leads me on.","Julius Caesar"
"630",2350469,2351876,"What's to do?","Julius Caesar"
"631",2352933,2355453,"A piece of workthat will make sick men whole.","Julius Caesar"
"632",2355685,2358238,"But are not some wholebut we must make sick?","Julius Caesar"
"633",2358949,2360542,"That must we also.","Julius Caesar"
"634",2375941,2378362,"Caesar! Help!","Julius Caesar"
"635",2378596,2380156,"Help!","Julius Caesar"
"636",2380932,2385471,"They murder Caesar! They murder Caesar!","Julius Caesar"
"637",2385700,2387610,"They murdered Caesar!","Julius Caesar"
"638",2387844,2390146,"They murdered Caesar!","Julius Caesar"
"639",2392741,2394334,"Who's within?","Julius Caesar"
"640",2395108,2396734,"Who's within?","Julius Caesar"
"641",2398308,2399290,"My lord.","Julius Caesar"
"642",2399364,2402942,"Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,and bring me their opinions of success.","Julius Caesar"
"643",2403012,2404419,"I will, my lord.","Julius Caesar"
"644",2419556,2423003,"Nor heaven nor earthhave been at peace tonight.","Julius Caesar"
"645",2426467,2428639,"What mean you, Caesar?","Julius Caesar"
"646",2428899,2430722,"Think you to walk forth?","Julius Caesar"
"647",2430915,2433468,"You shall not stir out of your house today.","Julius Caesar"
"648",2433827,2435288,"Caesar shall forth.","Julius Caesar"
"649",2435459,2437761,"The things that threatened menever looked but at my back,","Julius Caesar"
"650",2437827,2439965,"when they shall see the face of Caesar,they are vanished.","Julius Caesar"
"651",2440035,2441344,"Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"652",2441987,2444126,"I never stood on ceremonies.","Julius Caesar"
"653",2444579,2446140,"Yet now they fright me.","Julius Caesar"
"654",2446563,2449824,"There is one within, besidesthe things that we have heard and seen,","Julius Caesar"
"655",2449890,2452672,"recounts most horrid sightsseen by the watch.","Julius Caesar"
"656",2452995,2455296,"A lioness hath whelped in the streets,","Julius Caesar"
"657",2455523,2459232,"and graves have yawnedand yielded up their dead.","Julius Caesar"

"1089",4219479,4221715,"He hath brought many captiveshome to Rome,","Julius Caesar"
"1090",4221783,4225842,"whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?","Julius Caesar"
"1091",4227639,4230225,"When that the poor have cried,Caesar hath wept.","Julius Caesar"
"1092",4231415,4234382,"Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.","Julius Caesar"
"1093",4235446,4237934,"Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,","Julius Caesar"
"1094",4238743,4240881,"and Brutus is an honorable man.","Julius Caesar"
"1095",4242678,4247151,"You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crown,","Julius Caesar"
"1096",4247478,4249649,"which he did thrice refuse.","Julius Caesar"
"1097",4250198,4252303,"Was this ambition?","Julius Caesar"
"1098",4253398,4257173,"Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,and, sure, he is an honorable man.","Julius Caesar"
"1099",4260566,4263697,"I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,","Julius Caesar"
"1100",4264534,4267251,"but here I am to speak what I do know.","Julius Caesar"
"1101",4268310,4271092,"You all did love him once,not without cause.","Julius Caesar"
"1102",4271958,4274641,"What cause withholdsyou then to mourn for him?","Julius Caesar"
"1103",4275798,4278645,"O judgment!Thou art fled to brutish beasts,","Julius Caesar"
"1104",4278870,4281008,"and men have lost their reason!","Julius Caesar"
"1105",4287222,4289939,"Bear with me.My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"1106",4290006,4292340,"and I must pause till it come back to me.","Julius Caesar"
"1107",4299637,4302419,"Methinks there is much reasonin his saying.","Julius Caesar"
"1108",4304693,4308337,"If thou consider rightly of the matter,Caesar has had great wrong.","Julius Caesar"
"1109",4308725,4310252,"Has he, masters?","Julius Caesar"
"1110",4310549,4312970,"I fear there will a worse come in his place.","Julius Caesar"
"1111",4313109,4314635,"Marked ye his words?","Julius Caesar"
"1112",4314868,4316275,"He would not take the crown.","Julius Caesar"
"1113",4316340,4318610,"Therefore it is certainhe was not ambitious.","Julius Caesar"
"1114",4318677,4321394,"If it be found so, some will dear abide it.","Julius Caesar"
"1115",4322581,4325036,"There's not a nobler manin Rome than Antony.","Julius Caesar"
"1116",4325461,4329257,"Now mark him, he begins again to speak.","Julius Caesar"
"1117",4329780,4333075,"Poor soul.His eyes are red as fire with weeping.","Julius Caesar"
"1118",4334165,4338158,"But yesterday, the word of Caesarmight have stood against the world.","Julius Caesar"
"1119",4339124,4343085,"Now lies he there, and noneso poor to do him reverence.","Julius Caesar"
"1120",4345044,4346866,"O masters!","Julius Caesar"
"1121",4348276,4353032,"If I were disposed to stir your heartsand minds to mutiny and rage,","Julius Caesar"
"1122",4353204,4355954,"I should do Brutus wrongand Cassius wrong,","Julius Caesar"
"1123",4357011,4359695,"who, you all know, are honorable men.","Julius Caesar"
"1124",4361524,4363531,"I will not do them wrong.","Julius Caesar"
"1125",4364212,4366186,"I rather choose to wrong the dead,","Julius Caesar"
"1126",4366259,4369740,"to wrong myself and you,than I will wrong such honorable men.","Julius Caesar"
"1127",4370644,4372432,"But here's a parchment","Julius Caesar"
"1128",4372787,4376399,"with the seal of Caesar.I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will.","Julius Caesar"
"1129",4376819,4379186,"Let but the commons hear this testament,","Julius Caesar"
"1130",4380403,4383086,"which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,","Julius Caesar"
"1131",4383539,4386506,"and they would goand kiss dead Caesar's wounds,","Julius Caesar"
"1132",4387155,4389544,"and dip their napkins in his sacred blood,","Julius Caesar"
"1133",4389843,4393902,"yea, beg a hair of him for memory,and, dying, mention it within their wills,","Julius Caesar"
"1134",4394099,4396881,"bequeathing it as a rich legacyunto their issue.","Julius Caesar"
"1135",4396947,4399281,"We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony!","Julius Caesar"
"1136",4399346,4401234,"We will hear Caesar's will!","Julius Caesar"
"1137",4401299,4402826,"- The will!- The will!","Julius Caesar"
"1138",4402899,4403847,"We'll hear it, Antony!","Julius Caesar"
"1139",4403923,4406640,"Have patience, gentle friends.I must not read it.","Julius Caesar"
"1140",4407378,4410193,"It is not meet you knowhow Caesar loved you.","Julius Caesar"
"1141",4410578,4413360,"You are not wood,you are not stones, but men.","Julius Caesar"
"1142",4413906,4416143,"And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"1143",4416211,4418349,"it will inflame you, it will make you mad.","Julius Caesar"
"1144",4418866,4421517,"It is good you know notthat you are his heirs.","Julius Caesar"
"1145",4421842,4424231,"For if you should,O what would come of it?","Julius Caesar"
"1146",4424306,4426193,"Read the will. We'll hear it, Antony!","Julius Caesar"
"1147",4426258,4428746,"You shall read us the will, Caesar's will!","Julius Caesar"
"1148",4428850,4430225,"Read us the will!","Julius Caesar"
"1149",4431442,4433831,"Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?","Julius Caesar"
"1150",4433938,4436272,"I have overshot myself to tell you of it.","Julius Caesar"
"1151",4436498,4440775,"I fear I wrong the honorable menwhose daggers have stabbed Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"1152",4440850,4442606,"They were traitors. Honorable men!","Julius Caesar"
"1153",4442674,4444299,"- They were villains, murderers!- The will!","Julius Caesar"
"1154",4444369,4445744,"The will!","Julius Caesar"
"1155",4450098,4452432,"You will compel me then to read the will?","Julius Caesar"
"1156",4452594,4454765,"Then make a ring aroundthe corpse of Caesar,","Julius Caesar"
"1157",4454833,4456938,"and let me show you himthat made the will.","Julius Caesar"
"1158",4457009,4459246,"Shall I descend,and will you give me leave?","Julius Caesar"
"1159",4459314,4463470,"- Come down!- Come down!","Julius Caesar"
"1160",4482672,4484974,"If you have tears,","Julius Caesar"
"1161",4485489,4487856,"prepare to shed them now.","Julius Caesar"
"1162",4491824,4493864,"You all do know this mantle.","Julius Caesar"
"1163",4494544,4497511,"I remember the first time everCaesar put it on.","Julius Caesar"
"1164",4497872,4501766,"It was on a summer's evening in his tentthat day he overcame the Nervii.","Julius Caesar"
"1165",4502576,4505227,"Look, in this place ranCassius' dagger through.","Julius Caesar"
"1166",4505840,4507880,"See what a rent the envious Casca made.","Julius Caesar"
"1167",4507952,4511400,"Through thisthe well-beloved Brutus stabbed,","Julius Caesar"
"1168",4512272,4516549,"and, as he plucked his cursed steel away,mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,","Julius Caesar"
"1169",4517008,4521198,"as rushing out of doors, to be resolvedif Brutus so unkindly knocked or no.","Julius Caesar"
"1170",4521680,4524101,"For Brutus, as you know,was Caesar's angel.","Julius Caesar"
"1171",4524655,4527721,"Judge, O you gods,how dearly Caesar loved him!","Julius Caesar"
"1172",4528176,4530893,"This was the most unkindest cut of all.","Julius Caesar"
"1173",4531119,4534599,"For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,ingratitude,","Julius Caesar"
"1174",4534992,4538025,"more strong than traitors' arms,quite vanquished him,","Julius Caesar"
"1175",4538351,4540107,"then burst his mighty heart,","Julius Caesar"
"1176",4540175,4542379,"and, in his mantle muffling up his face,","Julius Caesar"
"1177",4542671,4546316,"even at the base of Pompey's statue,which all the while ran blood,","Julius Caesar"
"1178",4547247,4549287,"great Caesar fell.","Julius Caesar"
"1179",4550863,4554475,"O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!","Julius Caesar"
"1180",4555375,4556684,"Then I,","Julius Caesar"
"1181",4557007,4559789,"and you, and all of us fell down,","Julius Caesar"
"1182",4559887,4562669,"whilst bloody treason flourished over us.","Julius Caesar"
"1183",4566990,4568364,"Oh.","Julius Caesar"
"1184",4569103,4571143,"Now you weep.","Julius Caesar"
"1185",4572015,4575048,"And I perceive you feel the dint of pity.","Julius Caesar"
"1186",4576558,4578566,"These are gracious drops.","Julius Caesar"
"1187",4580430,4584903,"Kind souls, what, weep you when youbut behold our Caesar's vesture wounded?","Julius Caesar"
"1188",4586031,4587557,"Look you here.","Julius Caesar"
"1189",4587790,4590954,"Here is himself, marred,as you see, with traitors.","Julius Caesar"
"1190",4595150,4596710,"O noble Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"1191",4596942,4598731,"O most bloody sight.","Julius Caesar"
"1192",4609166,4611555,"- Traitors.- Villains.","Julius Caesar"
"1193",4616973,4620551,"- We will be revenged!- Let not a traitor live!","Julius Caesar"
"1194",4621550,4623273,"Stay, countrymen!","Julius Caesar"
"1195",4627853,4632261,"Good friends, sweet friends,let me not stir you up","Julius Caesar"
"1196",4632333,4634471,"to such a sudden flood of mutiny.","Julius Caesar"
"1197",4635309,4637730,"They that have done this deedare honorable.","Julius Caesar"
"1198",4639213,4641668,"What private griefs they have, alas,I know not","Julius Caesar"
"1199",4641741,4643148,"that made them do it.","Julius Caesar"
"1200",4643213,4644969,"They are wise and honorable,","Julius Caesar"
"1201",4645037,4647590,"and will, no doubt,with reasons answer you.","Julius Caesar"
"1202",4649389,4651756,"I come not, friends,to steal away your hearts.","Julius Caesar"
"1203",4651820,4653925,"I am no orator, as Brutus is,","Julius Caesar"
"1204",4654637,4656971,"but, as you know me all,a plain blunt man","Julius Caesar"
"1205",4657036,4660233,"that loved my friend,and that they know full well","Julius Caesar"
"1206",4660301,4662472,"that gave me public leave to speak of him.","Julius Caesar"
"1207",4662540,4666249,"For I have neither wit, nor words,nor worth, action, nor utterance,","Julius Caesar"
"1208",4666317,4668804,"nor the power of speechto stir men's blood.","Julius Caesar"
"1209",4669036,4672582,"I only speak right on. I tell you thatwhich you yourselves do know,","Julius Caesar"
"1210",4672844,4676772,"show you sweet Caesar's wounds,poor, poor dumb mouths,","Julius Caesar"
"1211",4676844,4678600,"and bid them speak for me.","Julius Caesar"
"1212",4679436,4682752,"But were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony,","Julius Caesar"
"1213",4683532,4686827,"there were an Antonywould ruffle up your spirits,","Julius Caesar"
"1214",4687243,4689731,"and put a tonguein every wound of Caesar","Julius Caesar"
"1215",4689804,4692422,"that should move the stones of Rometo rise and mutiny.","Julius Caesar"
"1216",4692491,4694630,"We'll mutiny!We'll burn the house of Brutus!","Julius Caesar"
"1217",4694700,4696707,"- Yet hear me, countrymen!- We'll mutiny!","Julius Caesar"
"1218",4696780,4698405,"Yet hear me speak!","Julius Caesar"
"1219",4699019,4701736,"Why, friends, you goto do you know not what.","Julius Caesar"
"1220",4702540,4704645,"Wherein hath Caesarthus deserved your love?","Julius Caesar"
"1221",4704716,4707945,"Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.","Julius Caesar"
"1222",4708011,4709767,"You have forgot the will I told you of.","Julius Caesar"
"1223",4709835,4710947,"The will!","Julius Caesar"
"1224",4713163,4716512,"Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.","Julius Caesar"

"1226",4722475,4724297,"75 drachmas!","Julius Caesar"
"1227",4727179,4730495,"Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,","Julius Caesar"
"1228",4731115,4734911,"his private arbors and new-plantedorchards on this side Tiber.","Julius Caesar"
"1229",4736043,4738978,"He hath left them youand to your heirs forever.","Julius Caesar"
"1230",4739723,4743497,"Common pleasures,to walk abroad and recreate yourselves.","Julius Caesar"
"1231",4746026,4747782,"Here was a Caesar.","Julius Caesar"
"1232",4749354,4752005,"When comes such another?","Julius Caesar"
"1233",4752074,4753448,"Never, never!","Julius Caesar"
"1234",4756074,4757350,"Go fetch fire!","Julius Caesar"
"1235",4757418,4760200,"Come away, away!","Julius Caesar"
"1236",4829096,4831485,"These many then shall die.Their names are pricked.","Julius Caesar"
"1237",4831560,4833218,"Your brother too must die.","Julius Caesar"
"1238",4833704,4835809,"- Consent you, Lepidus?- I do consent.","Julius Caesar"
"1239",4836424,4837406,"Prick him down, Antony.","Julius Caesar"
"1240",4837480,4839717,"Upon condition Publius shall not live,","Julius Caesar"
"1241",4840552,4842723,"who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.","Julius Caesar"
"1242",4843336,4846205,"He shall not live.Look, with a spot, I damn him.","Julius Caesar"
"1243",4848136,4850557,"But, Lepidus, go you fetch Caesar's will,","Julius Caesar"
"1244",4850728,4853957,"and we then shall determinehow to cut off some charge in legacies.","Julius Caesar"
"1245",4854023,4855332,"What, shall I meet you here?","Julius Caesar"
"1246",4855399,4857341,"Or here, or at the Capitol.","Julius Caesar"
"1247",4863560,4868099,"This is a slight unmeritable man,meet to be sent on errands.","Julius Caesar"
"1248",4869063,4870973,"Is it fit, the three-fold world divided,","Julius Caesar"
"1249",4871047,4873250,"he should standone of the three to share it?","Julius Caesar"
"1250",4873320,4874726,"So you thought him.","Julius Caesar"
"1251",4874919,4876992,"And took his voicewho should be pricked to die","Julius Caesar"
"1252",4877063,4879332,"in our black sentence and prescription.","Julius Caesar"
"1253",4880359,4882977,"Octavius, I have seen more days than you.","Julius Caesar"
"1254",4883239,4885278,"And though we lay these honorson this man","Julius Caesar"
"1255",4885350,4887903,"to ease ourselvesof diverse slanderous loads,","Julius Caesar"
"1256",4888230,4891045,"he shall but bear themas the ass bears gold,","Julius Caesar"
"1257",4891431,4895621,"to groan and sweat under the business,either led or driven, as we point the way.","Julius Caesar"
"1258",4895847,4897756,"And having brought our treasurewhere we will,","Julius Caesar"
"1259",4897830,4900318,"then take we down his loadand turn him off,","Julius Caesar"
"1260",4900487,4903999,"like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,and graze in common.","Julius Caesar"
"1261",4904102,4907648,"You may do your will,but he's a tried and valiant soldier.","Julius Caesar"
"1262",4908038,4912315,"So is my horse, Octavius, and for thatI do appoint him store of provender.","Julius Caesar"
"1263",4912390,4914975,"And now, Octavius, listen great things.","Julius Caesar"
"1264",4916166,4917889,"Brutus and Cassius are levying powers.","Julius Caesar"
"1265",4917958,4919168,"We must straight make head.","Julius Caesar"
"1266",4919238,4921573,"Therefore let our alliance be combined,","Julius Caesar"
"1267",4921702,4923262,"and let us presently go sit in council,","Julius Caesar"
"1268",4923334,4925723,"how covert mattersmay be best disclosed","Julius Caesar"
"1269",4925798,4927586,"and open perils surest answered.","Julius Caesar"
"1270",4927654,4932290,"Let us do so, for we are at the stake,and bayed about with many enemies,","Julius Caesar"
"1271",4932389,4936480,"and some that smile have in their hearts,I fear, millions of mischiefs.","Julius Caesar"
"1272",5001860,5004642,"Stand, ho!","Julius Caesar"
"1273",5005476,5008792,"Give the word, ho!","Julius Caesar"
"1274",5008996,5010588,"Stand, ho!","Julius Caesar"
"1275",5010659,5011936,"Stand, ho.","Julius Caesar"
"1276",5023139,5025114,"What now, Lucilius? Is Cassius near?","Julius Caesar"
"1277",5025188,5028984,"He is at hand, and Pindarus is cometo do you salutation from his master.","Julius Caesar"
"1278",5031971,5033564,"He greets me well.","Julius Caesar"
"1279",5034083,5036702,"Your master, Pindarus,in his own change, or by ill officers,","Julius Caesar"
"1280",5036771,5039967,"hath given me some worthy causeto wish things done, undone,","Julius Caesar"
"1281",5040035,5041661,"but if he be at hand, I shall be satisfied.","Julius Caesar"
"1282",5041731,5044545,"I do not doubt but thatmy noble master will appear,","Julius Caesar"
"1283",5044611,5046618,"such as he is, full of regard and honor.","Julius Caesar"
"1284",5046691,5048284,"He is not doubted.","Julius Caesar"
"1285",5048835,5052894,"A word, Lucilius.How he received you, let me be resolved.","Julius Caesar"
"1286",5053219,5056535,"With courtesy and with respect enough,but not with such familiar instances,","Julius Caesar"
"1287",5056611,5059807,"nor with such free and friendlyconference, as he hath used of old.","Julius Caesar"
"1288",5059874,5062460,"Thou has described a hot friend cooling.","Julius Caesar"
"1289",5062594,5065441,"Ever note, Lucilius, when love beginsto sicken and decay,","Julius Caesar"
"1290",5065507,5067612,"it useth an enforced ceremony.","Julius Caesar"
"1291",5067746,5069688,"There are no tricksin plain and simple faith.","Julius Caesar"
"1292",5069762,5071191,"Stand, ho!","Julius Caesar"
"1293",5084290,5086265,"Most noble brother,you have done me wrong.","Julius Caesar"
"1294",5086337,5088923,"Judge me, you gods!Wrong I mine enemies?","Julius Caesar"
"1295",5088994,5090368,"And, if not so,how should I wrong a brother?","Julius Caesar"
"1296",5090433,5093216,"Brutus, this sober form of yourshides wrongs, and when you do them...","Julius Caesar"
"1297",5093282,5095802,"Cassius, be content.Speak your griefs softly.","Julius Caesar"
"1298",5095906,5097149,"I do know you well.","Julius Caesar"

"590",3034031,3035031,"Important, huh?","Rear Window"
"591",3035116,3036616,"Well, it's probablynothing important at all.","Rear Window"
"592",3036701,3038785,"It's just a little neighborhoodmurder, that's all.","Rear Window"
"593",3038869,3039950,"Did you say ""murder"", Jeff?","Rear Window"
"594",3039954,3041579,"Yes, as a matter of fact,I did say ""murder"".","Rear Window"

"599",3051298,3052966,"This happens to be my day off.","Rear Window"

"607",3070985,3071985,"You called the police.","Rear Window"
"608",3072069,3073987,"Well, not exactly.","Rear Window"
"609",3074071,3077782,"Not an official call. It'sjust an old friend of mine.","Rear Window"
"610",3077867,3080910,"An old, ornery friend of mine.","Rear Window"
"611",3080995,3083830,"Just where do you suppose he cut her up?","Rear Window"
"612",3085499,3088001,"Of course. The bathtub.","Rear Window"
"613",3088878,3092922,"That's the only place where hecould have washed away the blood.","Rear Window"
"614",3101807,3105685,"He better get that trunk out ofthere before it starts to leak.","Rear Window"
"615",3127208,3128625,"Harry?","Rear Window"
"616",3134006,3136049,"Look, look, Mr. Jefferies.","Rear Window"
"617",3173754,3176035,"I thought Doyle would be hereby the time the trunk left,","Rear Window"

"622",3198028,3199654,"Long distance.","Rear Window"
"623",3224805,3228391,"You didn't see the killing or the body.How do you know there was a murder?","Rear Window"
"624",3228475,3231519,"Because everything this fellow'sdone has been suspicious.","Rear Window"
"625",3231604,3235356,"Trips at night in the rain, andknives and saws and trunks with rope","Rear Window"
"626",3235441,3237692,"and now this wife that isn't there anymore.","Rear Window"
"627",3237776,3242572,"I admit it all has a mysterious sound.It could be any number of things.","Rear Window"
"628",3242656,3243990,"Murder's the least plausible.","Rear Window"
"629",3244074,3246492,"Doyle, don't tell me he'san unemployed magician,","Rear Window"
"630",3246577,3249579,"amusing the neighborhood with hissleight of hand. Don't tell me that.","Rear Window"
"631",3249663,3252081,"It's too obvious and stupida way to commit murder.","Rear Window"
"632",3252166,3253791,"In full view of 50 windows?","Rear Window"
"633",3253876,3255084,"Then sit over there smoking a cigar,","Rear Window"
"634",3255169,3256753,"waiting for the policeto come and pick him up?","Rear Window"
"635",3256837,3259255,"All right, Officer, do your duty.Go over and pick him up.","Rear Window"
"636",3259340,3262592,"Jeff, you've got a lotto learn about homicide.","Rear Window"
"637",3262676,3264886,"Why, morons have committedmurder so shrewdly,","Rear Window"
"638",3264970,3268222,"it's taken a hundred trainedpolice minds to catch them.","Rear Window"
"639",3268307,3270934,"That salesman wouldn't justknock his wife off after dinner","Rear Window"
"640",3271018,3273519,"and toss her in the trunkand put her in storage.","Rear Window"
"641",3273604,3274938,"I'll bet it's been done.","Rear Window"
"642",3275022,3278232,"Most everything's been done, under panic.","Rear Window"
"643",3278317,3280401,"This is a thousand-to-one shot.","Rear Window"
"644",3280486,3283780,"He's still sitting around the apartment.That man's not panicked.","Rear Window"
"645",3283864,3285949,"You think I made all this up?","Rear Window"
"646",3286033,3287951,"Well, I think you saw something.","Rear Window"
"647",3288035,3290662,"There's probably a verysimple explanation for that.","Rear Window"
"648",3290746,3292288,"For instance?","Rear Window"
"649",3292373,3293915,"Wife took a trip.","Rear Window"
"650",3293999,3296000,"His wife was sick in bed.","Rear Window"
"651",3297461,3299253,"Yeah, so you told me.","Rear Window"
"652",3300839,3303299,"Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.","Rear Window"
"653",3304551,3309806,"I won't report this to the department.Let me poke into it a little on my own.","Rear Window"
"654",3309890,3312642,"No sense in your getting alot of ridiculous publicity.","Rear Window"
"655",3312726,3314060,"Thank you.","Rear Window"
"656",3316271,3319232,"We know the wife is gone, so I'llsee if I can find out where.","Rear Window"
"657",3319316,3320566,"Do that.","Rear Window"
"658",3321777,3324278,"You had any headaches lately?","Rear Window"
"659",3324363,3325738,"Not until you showed up.","Rear Window"
"660",3326782,3329784,"It'll wear off, alongwith the hallucinations.","Rear Window"
"661",3329868,3331452,"See you around.","Rear Window"
"662",3355853,3357311,"Get along.","Rear Window"
"663",3378584,3380084,"He has a six months' lease.","Rear Window"
"664",3380169,3383129,"Used up a little more thanfive and a half months of it.","Rear Window"
"665",3383213,3385631,"He's quiet, drinks, but not to drunkenness.","Rear Window"

"911",4476639,4479307,"Mr. Doyle, that can onlylead to one conclusion.","Rear Window"
"912",4479392,4480433,"Namely?","Rear Window"
"913",4480518,4484479,"That it was not Mrs. Thorwald thatleft with him yesterday morning.","Rear Window"
"914",4484564,4485981,"You figured that out, eh?","Rear Window"
"915",4486065,4488525,"Well, it's simply that womendon't leave their jewelry behind","Rear Window"
"916",4488609,4490610,"when they go on a trip.","Rear Window"
"917",4490903,4491903,"Come on, come on, Tom.","Rear Window"
"918",4491988,4495615,"Now you don't really need anyof this information, do you?","Rear Window"
"919",4501497,4503748,"As a matter of fact, I don't.","Rear Window"
"920",4509630,4512924,"Lars Thorwald is no morea murderer than I am.","Rear Window"

"923",4520975,4522851,"No, neither can you.","Rear Window"
"924",4522935,4525937,"That's a secret, private worldyou're looking into out there.","Rear Window"

"926",4529066,4530942,"Like disposing of their wives?","Rear Window"
"927",4531027,4533778,"You get that idea out of your mind.It'll only lead in the wrong direction.","Rear Window"
"928",4533863,4536323,"What about theknife and the saw?","Rear Window"
"929",4536407,4537991,"Did you ever own a saw?","Rear Window"
"930",4538075,4540744,"Well, at home inthe garage I had...","Rear Window"
"931",4540828,4543121,"How many peopledid you cut up with it?","Rear Window"
"932",4543206,4547626,"Or with the couple of hundred knivesyou've probably owned in your lifetime?","Rear Window"
"933",4548377,4550045,"Well, your logic is backward.","Rear Window"
"934",4550129,4554007,"You can't ignore the wife disappearingand the trunk and the jewelry.","Rear Window"
"935",4554091,4556843,"I checked the railroad station.He bought a ticket.","Rear Window"
"936",4556928,4558887,"Ten minutes later, he puthis wife on a train.","Rear Window"

"938",4562183,4565227,"That might have been a woman, but itcouldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.","Rear Window"
"939",4565311,4566853,"- That jewelry...- Look, Miss Fremont.","Rear Window"
"940",4566938,4569731,"That feminine intuitionstuff sells magazines.","Rear Window"
"941",4569815,4572776,"But in real life,it's still a fairy tale.","Rear Window"

"943",4574654,4577239,"tracking down leads basedon female intuition.","Rear Window"
"944",4577323,4579950,"All right. I take it youdidn't find the trunk,","Rear Window"
"945",4580034,4583536,"and all this is from an old speech youonce made at the Policemen's Ball.","Rear Window"
"946",4583621,4586122,"I found the trunk a half-hourafter I left here.","Rear Window"
"947",4586207,4589876,"I suppose it's normal for a man totie up a trunk with heavy rope?","Rear Window"
"948",4589961,4591962,"Well, if the lockis broken, yes.","Rear Window"
"949",4592046,4595173,"And what did you find inside the trunk?A surly note to me?","Rear Window"
"950",4595258,4597342,"Mrs. Thorwald's clothes.","Rear Window"

"953",4602848,4605725,"I sent them on theirmerry and legal way.","Rear Window"
"954",4605810,4608603,"Why, when a woman is takinga simple, short trip,","Rear Window"
"955",4608688,4610605,"does she takeeverything she owns?","Rear Window"
"956",4610690,4614401,"Let's let the female psychologydepartment handle that one.","Rear Window"
"957",4615361,4617821,"I would say it looked asif she wasn't coming back.","Rear Window"
"958",4617905,4619614,"That's what's knownas a family problem.","Rear Window"
"959",4619699,4622534,"And if she wasn't coming back,why didn't he tell his landlord?","Rear Window"
"960",4622618,4627414,"I'll tell you why he didn't tell hislandlord. Because he was hiding something.","Rear Window"
"961",4629500,4632002,"Do you tell yourlandlord everything?","Rear Window"
"962",4632086,4633795,"I told you to be careful, Tom.","Rear Window"
"963",4633879,4637080,"Look, if I'd have been careful pilotingthat reconnaissance plane during the war,","Rear Window"
"964",4637133,4638633,"you wouldn't have had thechance to take the pictures","Rear Window"
"965",4638718,4643138,"that won you a medal, and agood job, and fame and money.","Rear Window"
"966",4645433,4650020,"What do you say we all sit down andhave a nice, friendly drink, too? Hmm?","Rear Window"

"224",1176650,1180279,"- Careful, dearest.- She wore this glove in Romeo and Juliet...","Gaslight"
"225",1180349,1183250,"at the command performanceat Covent Garden.","Gaslight"
"226",1184619,1186680,"Gounod signed it for her afterwards.","Gaslight"
"227",1186759,1188779,"I never knew what happenedto the other glove.","Gaslight"
"228",1188859,1190089,"I used to ask her sometimes...","Gaslight"
"229",1190160,1192630,"but she'd only laughand say she'd given it away.","Gaslight"
"230",1192700,1195900,"A very great admirer.She would never tell me who.","Gaslight"
"231",1196000,1198059,"I wish I could have seen her.","Gaslight"
"232",1198140,1199829,"Let me show her to you.","Gaslight"
"233",1214190,1216480,"That's as the Empress Theodora.","Gaslight"
"234",1218119,1220220,"That was her greatest role.","Gaslight"
"235",1220829,1222450,"When she sang it in St. Petersburg...","Gaslight"
"236",1222529,1225160,"the Czar used to cometo every performance.","Gaslight"
"237",1225230,1228599,"She was very beautiful,very much like you.","Gaslight"
"238",1230170,1235000,"It was there that I found her,there in front of the fire...","Gaslight"
"239",1236109,1238009,"under her own portrait.","Gaslight"
"240",1239250,1242940,"I was in bed, and something woke me.I've never known what.","Gaslight"
"241",1243220,1245619,"I came running down the stairs...","Gaslight"
"242",1246519,1249319,"frightened, as if I knewwhat had happened.","Gaslight"
"243",1250160,1252059,"She had been strangled.","Gaslight"
"244",1257700,1261660,"She had been strangled.Her lovely face was all...","Gaslight"
"245",1266710,1268539,"No, I can't stay here.","Gaslight"
"246",1275880,1280720,"Then how would it be if we took awayall these things that remind you so of her?","Gaslight"
"247",1280890,1285349,"The painting, all this furniture.Shut it away so you can't even see it?","Gaslight"
"248",1285420,1288759,"Suppose we make it a new housewith new things, beautiful things...","Gaslight"
"249",1288829,1290390,"for a new, beautiful life for us.","Gaslight"
"250",1290460,1294299,"Yes, and then later,we'll have people here and parties again.","Gaslight"
"251",1297069,1301839,"- Don't you want to?- Later, yes, but not just at once.","Gaslight"
"252",1302369,1305779,"Let us have our honeymoon hereby ourselves for a little longer.","Gaslight"

"255",1312319,1315119,"Now, where should we putall these things?","Gaslight"
"256",1315450,1317180,"There is an attic under the roof.","Gaslight"
"257",1317259,1319690,"All her trunks are up thereand all her costumes.","Gaslight"
"258",1319759,1323089,"Then we'll put all these there, too,and then we'll board it up...","Gaslight"
"259",1323160,1326960,"so you'll never have to see it again,never even think of it.","Gaslight"
"260",1327130,1330759,"That piano traveled with her everywherein the great days.","Gaslight"
"261",1332470,1336430,"It will need tuning terribly.Look, here's some of her music.","Gaslight"
"262",1337109,1339269,"Her score of Theodora, just as she left it.","Gaslight"
"263",1339349,1341400,"We'll send those upstairs with all the rest.","Gaslight"
"264",1341480,1344509,"No, not her music.Perhaps later I might like to study again.","Gaslight"
"265",1344579,1347420,"I'd like to have her scores to study from.","Gaslight"
"266",1349920,1352410,"- What makes you play that?- Why not?","Gaslight"
"267",1352859,1354690,"That was her great song.","Gaslight"
"268",1354759,1357990,"She always used it in her concertsfor her last encore.","Gaslight"
"269",1358059,1360190,"It was everybody's favorite.","Gaslight"
"270",1369039,1370910,"Here's an old letter.","Gaslight"
"271",1371809,1375079,"""Dear Miss Alquist,I beg of you to see me just once more.","Gaslight"

"278",1396599,1398900,"I didn't mean to be so violent.","Gaslight"
"279",1399099,1400769,"It's just that...","Gaslight"
"280",1401539,1403970,"Why does this letter upset you so?","Gaslight"
"281",1404039,1408910,"It's not the letter.It's just that I am upset for you.","Gaslight"
"282",1409819,1412109,"All these things are reminding you of her.","Gaslight"
"283",1412180,1415950,"You said that you had lost your fears,and now everything you touch here...","Gaslight"
"284",1416019,1418220,"brings them back.","Gaslight"
"285",1418819,1422450,"While you are afraid of anything,there cannot be any happiness for us.","Gaslight"
"286",1422529,1424359,"You must forget her.","Gaslight"
"287",1424759,1426289,"No, not her.","Gaslight"
"288",1428029,1430059,"Only what happened to her.","Gaslight"

"317",1520730,1522559,"That's why she left.","Gaslight"
"318",1523630,1525930,"It may seem a little unusual...","Gaslight"
"319",1526000,1530769,"but your mistress is inclinedto be rather highly strung.","Gaslight"
"320",1531970,1533700,"Elizabeth, come in.","Gaslight"

"370",1725529,1728190,"I don't know. Not as I can see.","Gaslight"
"371",1729230,1731960,"But the master keeps telling her she is.","Gaslight"

"391",1838109,1840809,"I have no idea who he is.He seemed to know me and...","Gaslight"
"392",1840880,1842970,"Do you usually bowto people you don't know?","Gaslight"
"393",1843049,1844910,"No. I supposed I'd met him somewhere.","Gaslight"
"394",1844980,1848279,"- Are you telling me the truth?- Of course. Why should I lie?","Gaslight"
"395",1848349,1851720,"- I don't know who he is.- Yet you smiled at him. Why?","Gaslight"
"396",1852059,1855390,"I tell you, I wasn't thinking.I don't know why I did it.","Gaslight"

"433",2002410,2005970,"I'm sorry I spoiled the dayby bringing you home so soon.","Gaslight"
"434",2007079,2010069,"You should lie downand rest for a little, Paula.","Gaslight"
"435",2010150,2012450,"Should I stay with youand not go out this evening?","Gaslight"
"436",2012519,2014710,"No. You go and work as usual.","Gaslight"
"437",2015190,2017250,"Can you really workin that room you rented?","Gaslight"
"438",2017319,2019690,"I wish you'd let me see itand make it attractive.","Gaslight"
"439",2019759,2022849,"I never notice my surroundingswhen I'm working.","Gaslight"
"440",2027400,2030960,"You might give me your broachso I can have it repaired.","Gaslight"
"441",2032099,2034539,"What's the matter? Anything wrong?","Gaslight"
"442",2040410,2042140,"I can't find it.","Gaslight"
"443",2042950,2044039,"What?","Gaslight"
"444",2045980,2048650,"I missed it when we were in the Tower.","Gaslight"
"445",2051559,2053679,"I must turn everything out.","Gaslight"
"446",2059099,2062400,"I know it was here. I can't understand it.","Gaslight"
"447",2062969,2065769,"I couldn't have lost it. It must be here.","Gaslight"
"448",2065900,2067699,"I'm sure it's there.","Gaslight"
"449",2069010,2070300,"It's not.","Gaslight"
"450",2071510,2075880,"Paula, didn't I tell you?How did you come to lose it?","Gaslight"
"451",2079449,2081920,"I must have pulled it outwith something, I suppose.","Gaslight"
"452",2081989,2085079,"- I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me.- Forgive, my dear?","Gaslight"
"453",2085159,2088590,"It's not as serious as that.It's not valuable.","Gaslight"
"454",2090460,2094460,"Your present to me, your mother's broach.I wanted to wear it always.","Gaslight"
"455",2096300,2099829,"I don't remember opening my bag.I suppose I must have.","Gaslight"
"456",2099940,2101929,"You did put it in there?","Gaslight"
"457",2102409,2104599,"Don't you even remember that?","Gaslight"
"458",2106780,2108610,"Yes, of course, I do.","Gaslight"
"459",2110250,2113880,"But suddenly, I am beginningnot to trust my memory at all.","Gaslight"
"460",2116219,2119090,"I tell you, you're just tired, that's all.","Gaslight"
"461",2119460,2123150,"It doesn't mean anything.I'm sure it doesn't.","Gaslight"
"462",2124159,2127760,"Don't worry so, Paula. Don't worry.","Gaslight"
"463",2139539,2142780,"- Nancy, has the master left?- Yes, ma'am. A little while ago.","Gaslight"
"464",2142849,2145840,"Please see that he has plenty of coalon the fire in his room.","Gaslight"
"465",2145920,2148039,"You already told me that, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"466",2160829,2163559,"Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there?","Gaslight"
"467",2164139,2166159,"Turn it up? No, why?","Gaslight"
"468",2166239,2169210,"I thought it went down in here,as if you had.","Gaslight"
"469",2169409,2172599,"- I never touched it.- But this went down.","Gaslight"
"470",2174949,2177920,"Perhaps Elizabethlit another jet in the kitchen.","Gaslight"
"471",2177980,2180510,"Couldn't have been her.She's been in bed for an hour.","Gaslight"
"472",2180590,2182579,"I could hear her snoring.","Gaslight"
"473",2183789,2185190,"That's odd.","Gaslight"
"474",2188389,2191119,"- Good night, Nancy.- Good night, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"475",2221789,2224349,"- Yes, that's it.- I beg your pardon?","Gaslight"
"476",2224429,2227059,"I said that's it. That's the Alquist house.","Gaslight"
"477",2229369,2232960,"It happened in the drawing room, upstairs.That window.","Gaslight"
"478",2233340,2236829,"I live just across the square.My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites.","Gaslight"
"479",2236909,2238710,"- How do you do?- How do you do?","Gaslight"
"480",2238780,2241610,"Perhaps you could tell me,has the house been occupied long?","Gaslight"
"481",2241679,2244510,"About four or five months now.Come along.","Gaslight"
"482",2245250,2248409,"You don't happen to knowwho's living in the house, do you?","Gaslight"
"483",2248489,2252650,"Yes. A foreign couple. Anton's the name.Something mysterious there.","Gaslight"
"484",2253360,2256119,"- What do you mean, mysterious?- Never have visitors...","Gaslight"
"485",2256190,2259159,"never go out anywhere.At least, she doesn't.","Gaslight"
"486",2259460,2260949,"I think you're wrong.","Gaslight"
"487",2261030,2264369,"There aren't as many as usual here today.Come along, pigeons.","Gaslight"
"488",2264440,2266670,"Come along, sparrows. What did you say?","Gaslight"
"489",2266739,2270110,"You seem to be wrongabout her not going out.","Gaslight"
"490",2285960,2287719,"How very surprising.","Gaslight"
"491",2289860,2292960,"It's you, ma'am.I never knew you'd gone out.","Gaslight"
"492",2293329,2295889,"I went for a walk,but it looks as if it might rain...","Gaslight"
"493",2295969,2299159,"- so I thought I should have my umbrella.- Of course, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"494",2302210,2305469,"Suppose the master comes backand asks where you've gone?","Gaslight"
"495",2305539,2308980,"- Tell him I just went for a walk.- By yourself, ma'am?","Gaslight"
"496",2309309,2313179,"- Of course. Why not?- Suppose the master asks where?","Gaslight"
"497",2316250,2318750,"Tell him I just...","Gaslight"
"498",2331139,2334329,"Now do you see what I mean?Goes out, goes back, goes in.","Gaslight"
"499",2334409,2336199,"Odd. Definitely odd.","Gaslight"
"500",2337340,2341179,"It's an odd household, too.That maidservant, most impertinent.","Gaslight"
"501",2341480,2344309,"I can't get a thing out of her.She won't talk to me...","Gaslight"
"502",2344380,2347550,"though she would quick enoughif I wore trousers.","Gaslight"
"503",2348590,2351559,"The way she carries onwith that policeman on the beat.","Gaslight"
"504",2351619,2353219,"It's scandalous!","Gaslight"
"505",2354829,2359659,"There, that's all there is.Fly away, pigeons. More tomorrow.","Gaslight"
"506",2361570,2362659,"Well!","Gaslight"
"507",2365070,2367369,"Paper! Thank you, sir. There you are, sir.","Gaslight"
"508",2367440,2371199,"Extra. Special. Special edition.Read all about it.","Gaslight"
"509",2374780,2377750,"Here you are, governor. Paper?Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.","Gaslight"
"510",2380820,2384949,"Put that file back where you got it.I tell you, the case is dead.","Gaslight"
"511",2385019,2387820,"I'm not going to have it all dug up againfor nothing.","Gaslight"
"512",2387889,2391159,"Do you understand?You had no right to go through that file.","Gaslight"
"513",2391429,2394190,"- Budge had no right to let you get at it.- Sorry, General.","Gaslight"
"514",2394269,2397670,"- Mr. Cameron is your assistant...- Then it's his job to assist me...","Gaslight"
"515",2397739,2401800,"not go digging into 10-year-old caseson wild suspicions of his own.","Gaslight"
"516",2401909,2405309,"- Now then, Budge, you get along.- Very good, General.","Gaslight"
"517",2411550,2413519,"What's your interest in this case, anyway?","Gaslight"
"518",2413579,2415309,"It was rather a famous case...","Gaslight"
"519",2415389,2417679,"and it impressed me very muchat the time.","Gaslight"
"520",2417760,2419150,"Besides...","Gaslight"
"521",2420119,2422960,"I once met Alice Alquist.I was taken to hear her...","Gaslight"
"522",2423030,2426019,"at a command performancewhen I was 12 years old...","Gaslight"
"523",2426099,2429260,"and afterwardsto meet her in the artists' room.","Gaslight"
"524",2430599,2434039,"It sounds silly, but I still thinkshe was the most beautiful woman...","Gaslight"
"525",2434110,2436900,"I ever saw, and I've never forgotten her.","Gaslight"
"526",2437840,2440329,"- And now...- You've seen someone who looks like her.","Gaslight"
"527",2440409,2442570,"- Living in the same house.- Why shouldn't she?","Gaslight"
"528",2442650,2445079,"If she's the niece,the house probably belongs to her.","Gaslight"
"529",2445150,2447619,"And if you're trying to meeta pretty woman...","Gaslight"
"530",2447690,2450519,"you've no right to use official businessas an excuse.","Gaslight"
"531",2450619,2452590,"It's not that, sir.","Gaslight"
"532",2452690,2457090,"But I tell you, sir, I have a feelingthere's something peculiar going on there.","Gaslight"
"533",2457730,2459289,"Perhaps even more than peculiar.","Gaslight"
"534",2459360,2463059,"Look here, Brian, once and for all,the case was given up as hopeless.","Gaslight"
"535",2463130,2467159,"As for the matter of the jewels,that was dropped by order...","Gaslight"
"536",2468139,2470070,"of a most important personage.","Gaslight"
"537",2471039,2472269,"Jewels?","Gaslight"
"538",2474349,2476780,"There's nothing here about jewels.","Gaslight"
"539",2481320,2484780,"There were some jewels.They were given to her...","Gaslight"
"540",2485760,2488059,"by somebody very highly placed.","Gaslight"
"541",2488889,2491329,"Some of the crown jewels of his...","Gaslight"
"542",2492030,2495659,"- Of another country, as a matter of fact.- What happened to them?","Gaslight"
"543",2495730,2499170,"- They disappeared.- That's why she was murdered.","Gaslight"
"544",2499599,2501800,"That was the official theory.","Gaslight"
"545",2501969,2505500,"Though what the murdererwanted the jewels for I can't imagine.","Gaslight"
"546",2505579,2508039,"They were too famousfor him to be able to sell them.","Gaslight"
"547",2508110,2510880,"- Have they never shown up since?- Not as far as I know.","Gaslight"
"548",2510949,2513280,"Well then, where are they?","Gaslight"
"549",2514349,2517809,"I don't know. The murder part of the casewas pursued to the utmost...","Gaslight"
"550",2517889,2522260,"as you can see for yourself from that file.There was never any case against anyone.","Gaslight"
"551",2522360,2524389,"There were the usual blind-alley suspects.","Gaslight"
"552",2524460,2527059,"You've read all their names therein that stuff.","Gaslight"
"553",2527130,2530360,"And there was never anythingto prove against any of them.","Gaslight"
"554",2530440,2533369,"Now run along, there's a good fellow.I'm busy.","Gaslight"
"555",2534409,2535900,"Very well, sir.","Gaslight"
"556",2539579,2541070,"Good day, sir.","Gaslight"
"557",2551489,2553389,"- Afternoon, Mr. Cameron.- Williams.","Gaslight"
"558",2558199,2560289,"- Did you want me, sir?- Yes.","Gaslight"
"559",2562230,2565099,"Tell me, you're not a married man,are you?","Gaslight"
"560",2565340,2566599,"No, sir.","Gaslight"
"561",2567840,2571300,"- Where are you on duty now?- Down in the East End, sir.","Gaslight"
"562",2571380,2573469,"How would you likea more fashionable locality?","Gaslight"
"563",2573539,2577280,"- I'd like it very much, sir.- We'll see what can be done about it.","Gaslight"
"564",2578250,2581050,"Don't say anything to anybodyfor the moment.","Gaslight"
"565",2631070,2634940,"If you want coal on the fire, Paula,why don't you ring for the maid?","Gaslight"
"566",2635010,2638199,"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.Go back to sleep, dear.","Gaslight"
"567",2638280,2639610,"No, Paula.","Gaslight"
"568",2640039,2643280,"Now that you have wakened me,we might as well be comfortable.","Gaslight"
"569",2643349,2646079,"- Ring for the maid.- I can put it on myself.","Gaslight"
"570",2646179,2648980,"We've had this subject out before.","Gaslight"
"571",2651860,2654829,"Please, pull the bell cord.","Gaslight"
"572",2657800,2659960,"It seems so unnecessary.","Gaslight"
"573",2660130,2662929,"What do you suppose the servants are for?","Gaslight"
"574",2664199,2667539,"Answer me.What do you suppose the servants are for?","Gaslight"
"575",2670170,2672940,"To do things. To serve us, I suppose.","Gaslight"
"576",2674010,2675139,"Exactly.","Gaslight"
"577",2675210,2678380,"It's only that I thinkwe should consider them a little.","Gaslight"
"578",2681820,2683750,"Don't be cross with me.","Gaslight"
"579",2684820,2686949,"I'm not cross with you.","Gaslight"
"580",2689360,2691449,"There are a lot of things...","Gaslight"
"581",2696869,2699769,"- Did you ring, sir?- No. Your mistress rang.","Gaslight"
"582",2702670,2706130,"Go on. Why don't you tell Nancywhat you rang for?","Gaslight"
"583",2706280,2710110,"- A little coal on the fire, please, Nancy.- Very good, madam.","Gaslight"
"584",2714190,2717050,"You're looking very pretty this afternoon,do you know that?","Gaslight"
"585",2717119,2719559,"I don't know it at all, sir, I'm sure.","Gaslight"
"586",2719619,2722289,"- Tonight is your night out, isn't it?- That's right, sir.","Gaslight"
"587",2722360,2726389,"Whom are you meeting tonight?You might light the gas, too, Nancy.","Gaslight"
"588",2726599,2729000,"I see they've changedthe policeman on the beat.","Gaslight"
"589",2729070,2733130,"Is his heart going to be addedto the list of those you've broken?","Gaslight"
"590",2733239,2736429,"- I didn't know I'd broken any, sir.- I'm sure that's not true.","Gaslight"
"591",2736510,2738840,"And that complexion of yours...","Gaslight"
"592",2739940,2742170,"that's somethingthat's not quite true, either.","Gaslight"
"593",2742250,2744869,"You do it very cleverly, I grant you.","Gaslight"
"594",2746519,2750420,"In fact, I was wonderingwhether you might not care...","Gaslight"
"595",2750489,2753050,"to pass some of your secretson to your mistress...","Gaslight"
"596",2753119,2755289,"and help her get rid of her pallor.","Gaslight"
"597",2755360,2758659,"Sure. I'd be very pleasedto do anything I can, sir.","Gaslight"
"598",2759429,2763590,"- Will that be all you're wanting?- Yes, except tea when it's ready.","Gaslight"
"599",2763699,2765230,"Very good, sir.","Gaslight"
"600",2772639,2775170,"How can you talk to Nancy like that?","Gaslight"
"601",2776880,2779849,"You seem so anxiousto regard the servants as your equals.","Gaslight"
"602",2779920,2783510,"I thought I would treat her as one.Besides, I was only trifling with her.","Gaslight"
"603",2783590,2786679,"No wonder that girl despises me,the way you encourage her.","Gaslight"
"604",2786789,2789889,"Despises you?Whatever makes you think that?","Gaslight"
"605",2789960,2791760,"Her whole manner!","Gaslight"
"606",2791829,2795389,"The way she talks to me,the way she looks at me.","Gaslight"
"607",2797170,2798639,"Looks at you?","Gaslight"
"608",2801909,2805170,"I hope you're not startingto imagine things again.","Gaslight"
"609",2805309,2808400,"- You're not, are you, Paula?- Of course I'm not.","Gaslight"
"610",2808480,2813139,"I hope you're not, but if you start talkingabout the way Nancy looks at you...","Gaslight"
"611",2813219,2816579,"Don't turn away, Paula.We must have this out.","Gaslight"
"612",2818860,2821550,"Do you really think Nancy despises you?","Gaslight"
"613",2823489,2825889,"Answer me, Paula. Do you?","Gaslight"
"614",2828369,2829389,"No, Gregory.","Gaslight"
"615",2830429,2834500,"I'm glad of that.It hurts me when you're ill and fanciful.","Gaslight"
"616",2835010,2836300,"Come in.","Gaslight"
"617",2837909,2839340,"What is it now?","Gaslight"
"618",2839409,2842280,"If you please, sir,Miss Thwaites is downstairs.","Gaslight"
"619",2842349,2844780,"She wanted to knowif the mistress was at home.","Gaslight"
"620",2844880,2847210,"You mean that old busybodyfrom across the square?","Gaslight"
"621",2847280,2849150,"Yes, sir. She has her nephew with her.","Gaslight"
"622",2849219,2851619,"I don't thinkwe need bore ourselves with them.","Gaslight"
"623",2851690,2855590,"- Tell her your mistress is not at home.- Gregory, really, she's been...","Gaslight"
"624",2855960,2858860,"My dear, if you let her in once,you'll always have her here.","Gaslight"
"625",2858929,2861900,"But she's called so often,and we've never been at home to her...","Gaslight"
"626",2861969,2864760,"I do not want people all over this house!","Gaslight"
"627",2872079,2874269,"Bringing her family with her.","Gaslight"
"628",2874880,2876940,"You tell Miss Thwaites...","Gaslight"
"629",2877050,2880210,"that your mistress is sorry,but she's not well enough to see her.","Gaslight"
"630",2880280,2881719,"Very good, sir.","Gaslight"
"631",2886690,2891130,"Gregory, why did you do that?I would've liked to have seen her.","Gaslight"
"632",2891559,2894119,"I thought you were only tryingto be polite.","Gaslight"
"633",2894199,2897030,"Why didn't you tell meyou really wanted to see her?","Gaslight"
"634",2897329,2899800,"I couldn't in front of that girl.","Gaslight"
"635",2899869,2903309,"You must get overthis ridiculous fear of the servants.","Gaslight"
"636",2903610,2907130,"If you really wanted to see her,all you had to say was:","Gaslight"
"637",2907210,2909340,"""Show her up, Nancy,"" wasn't it?","Gaslight"

"851",4378250,4380880,"Are you trying to tell me I'm insane?","Gaslight"
"852",4381979,4385850,"- That's what I'm trying not to tell myself.- But that's what you think, isn't it?","Gaslight"
"853",4385920,4389619,"That's what you've been hintingand suggesting for months, ever since...","Gaslight"
"854",4389689,4393319,"- Since what?- Since the day I lost your broach.","Gaslight"
"855",4394460,4396399,"Yes, that's when it all began.","Gaslight"
"856",4396869,4400430,"No, it began before that.","Gaslight"
"857",4400840,4403399,"The first day here,when I found that letter.","Gaslight"
"858",4407010,4410569,"- What letter?- The one I found among the music...","Gaslight"
"859",4411010,4414140,"from that man called Bauer.","Gaslight"
"860",4414220,4417670,"Sergis Bauer. Yes, I remember.","Gaslight"
"861",4417819,4420550,"Yes, you're right. That's when it began.","Gaslight"
"862",4420819,4424520,"I can see you still,standing there and saying:","Gaslight"
"863",4424590,4428550,"""Look at this letter,""and staring at nothing.","Gaslight"
"864",4429369,4431630,"- What?- You had nothing in your hand.","Gaslight"
"865",4432369,4433390,"What?","Gaslight"
"866",4433939,4436630,"I was staggered, but I didn't know then...","Gaslight"
"867",4436710,4438369,"how much reason I had to be.","Gaslight"
"868",4438439,4442340,"- I don't know. What reason?- I didn't know then about your mother.","Gaslight"
"869",4442649,4444170,"What about my mother?","Gaslight"
"870",4446649,4448449,"Your mother was mad.","Gaslight"
"871",4450449,4453149,"She died in an asylumwhen you were a year old.","Gaslight"
"872",4453890,4455250,"That's not true.","Gaslight"
"873",4455689,4458819,"I've been making inquiriesabout Alice Alquist's sister.","Gaslight"
"874",4459000,4461520,"I've talked to the doctor who attended her.","Gaslight"
"875",4461630,4463119,"- Would you like to see him?- No.","Gaslight"
"876",4463199,4466430,"He described her symptoms to me.Would you like to hear them?","Gaslight"
"877",4466500,4470729,"It began with her imagining things,that she heard noises, footsteps, voices...","Gaslight"
"878",4470810,4473300,"and then the voices began to speak to her.","Gaslight"
"879",4473939,4476640,"In the end, she died in an asylumwith no brain at all.","Gaslight"
"880",4476710,4478409,"No! Please stop.","Gaslight"
"881",4482420,4486220,"Now perhaps you will understanda lot of things about yourself and me.","Gaslight"
"882",4486390,4490380,"Now perhaps you will understandwhy I cannot let you meet people.","Gaslight"
"883",4492130,4496460,"He must have been rather disappointedthat you left before he could talk to you.","Gaslight"
"884",4497500,4498489,"Who?","Gaslight"
"885",4499039,4501159,"The man who was sitting behind us.","Gaslight"
"886",4502840,4504199,"- Where?- Tonight.","Gaslight"
"887",4504670,4507140,"You only went because you knewhe would be there.","Gaslight"
"888",4507210,4508680,"What, Gregory? Who?","Gaslight"
"889",4508939,4511670,"The man who bowed to you that dayat the Tower.","Gaslight"
"890",4512109,4515810,"Who is he, someone from the past?Someone you refused, perhaps?","Gaslight"
"891",4516050,4518949,"I never met him.I have no idea who he is.","Gaslight"
"892",4519390,4522189,"Who is he?Why is he dogging my footsteps?","Gaslight"
"893",4522859,4524550,"I don't know that he is.","Gaslight"
"894",4525689,4529289,"- You lie. Why do you lie to me?- I never lie to you.","Gaslight"
"895",4533199,4536369,"I'm sorry. I should not have said that.","Gaslight"
"896",4538470,4542500,"I know you never lie to me. I believe you.","Gaslight"
"897",4546319,4549220,"You're not lying. It's worse than lying.","Gaslight"
"898",4549520,4552850,"You've forgotten. You've forgotten himas you forget everything.","Gaslight"
"899",4552920,4556380,"But perhaps I'm wrongto try to handle this myself.","Gaslight"
"900",4557930,4560989,"The case is one for peoplewho know about those things.","Gaslight"
"901",4563729,4566569,"We shall have visitors, and shortly.","Gaslight"
"902",4568699,4570300,"- A doctor?- Two.","Gaslight"
"903",4571310,4573539,"I believe two is the required number.","Gaslight"
"904",4612819,4613800,"Yes?","Gaslight"
"905",4642010,4643739,"It's you, Constable.","Gaslight"
"906",4645479,4646880,"Good evening, sir.","Gaslight"
"907",4646949,4650210,"- Nasty night to be out, isn't it?- Very nasty, sir, indeed.","Gaslight"
"908",4702670,4703729,"Where'd he go?","Gaslight"
"909",4703810,4705930,"He didn't get past me asI came through the alley.","Gaslight"
"910",4706010,4709069,"He certainly turned in here.You must have missed him in the fog.","Gaslight"
"911",4709140,4712199,"I'd have heard his footstepsas he passed, Mr. Cameron.","Gaslight"
"912",4713880,4716109,"He must've goneinto the rear of one of these houses.","Gaslight"
"913",4716189,4717949,"Yes, but which? And why?","Gaslight"
"914",4719050,4721579,"Do you think he could have goneinto his own house?","Gaslight"
"915",4721659,4725989,"- Lf he did, sir, that's not against the law.- No, but it's against common sense.","Gaslight"
"916",4726199,4729789,"Why should he walk out of his own houseand all the way around the corner...","Gaslight"
"917",4729869,4731989,"just to get back to where he started from?","Gaslight"
"918",4732069,4734539,"But the service entrance to Number 9is out front.","Gaslight"
"919",4734600,4737159,"There's no way into Number 9from back here.","Gaslight"
"920",4738310,4741369,"- Then where did he go?- Number 5 is empty.","Gaslight"
"921",4742750,4745710,"But what would he want to gointo an empty house for?","Gaslight"
"922",4746250,4747880,"I don't know, Williams.","Gaslight"
"923",4807340,4808810,"Just coming, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"924",4817250,4818649,"What is it, ma'am?","Gaslight"
"925",4822090,4825579,"- I want you to help me. I'm so tired.- Yes, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"926",4844250,4846409,"Did you turn on the gas?","Gaslight"
"927",4846920,4849850,"Did you turn on the gasanywhere downstairs just now?","Gaslight"
"928",4849949,4853750,"Why, no, ma'am. I've had it onin the kitchen all evening, that's all.","Gaslight"
"929",4855560,4858029,"I thought it went down in there,as if someone...","Gaslight"
"930",4858090,4860579,"had turned it onin some other part of the house.","Gaslight"
"931",4860659,4864189,"There's no one in the housebut me, ma'am. Nancy's not back yet.","Gaslight"
"932",4868340,4870460,"But the gas comes in pipes, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"933",4870539,4874029,"And I expect they get more gasin the pipes at some times...","Gaslight"
"934",4874109,4875840,"than they does at others.","Gaslight"
"935",4878779,4881050,"Yes, I suppose that could explain it.","Gaslight"
"936",4894600,4897000,"- Do you hear anything?- Hear anything, ma'am?","Gaslight"
"937",4897069,4900130,"- Yes. Up there. Listen.- Listen to what, ma'am?","Gaslight"
"938",4900600,4904159,"Those sounds. Those noises up there.","Gaslight"
"939",4904569,4905630,"No, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"940",4908739,4911409,"But there are sounds.Sounds like someone moving about.","Gaslight"
"941",4912279,4916220,"- Elizabeth, listen, please.- There are no noises up there, ma'am.","Gaslight"
"942",4916289,4920050,"How could there be?The whole floor is boarded up.","Gaslight"
"943",4920189,4923819,"You know that as well as I do.No one can't get in up there.","Gaslight"
"944",4924529,4926930,"You know, ma'am,you just imagine things.","Gaslight"
"945",4954260,4958090,"Williams, come in. You're early.Get another cup, will you?","Gaslight"
"946",4958890,4961920,"- Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.- Thank you, sir.","Gaslight"
"947",4962000,4963159,"Well?","Gaslight"
"948",4968699,4972069,"I don't know what it means,but this morning around 3:00...","Gaslight"
"949",4972140,4976130,"I was standing on the corner ofThornton Square, looking both ways-like...","Gaslight"
"950",4976250,4979909,"and suddenly, who should I see turning up,but our friend again.","Gaslight"
"951",4979979,4982579,"- Coming out of the mews, it looked like.- Yes?","Gaslight"
"952",4982649,4985090,"I got a good look at himunder the lamppost.","Gaslight"
"953",4985149,4987850,"I tell you, that manhad been up to something.","Gaslight"
"954",4987920,4988909,"What?","Gaslight"
"955",4988989,4991859,"I wouldn't undertake to say what exactly...","Gaslight"
"956",4992159,4993890,"but he was kind of in a mess.","Gaslight"
"957",4994260,4998859,"Clothes untidy, tie all on one side.Dirt and dust all over, even on his face.","Gaslight"
"958",4999100,5002229,"- Had he been in a fight?- He didn't look like that, sir.","Gaslight"
"959",5002670,5005899,"More as though he'd been diggingin a cellar or something.","Gaslight"
"960",5007239,5008329,"Have some coffee.","Gaslight"
"961",5008409,5010670,"Thank you, sir.I've had my breakfast already.","Gaslight"
"962",5010750,5013720,"Had it in the kitchen at Number 9,as a matter of fact.","Gaslight"
"963",5013779,5015409,"Nancy tell you anything this morning?","Gaslight"
"964",5015479,5018539,"If you ask me, Nancy's getting ideasabove her station.","Gaslight"
"965",5018750,5019979,"Seems the master told her...","Gaslight"
"966",5020060,5023460,"that her mistress might be going awayfor quite a long time...","Gaslight"
"967",5023760,5026189,"and that he wanted her to stayand look after him.","Gaslight"
"968",5026260,5028729,"The master told herher mistress might be going away?","Gaslight"
"969",5028800,5030199,"That's right, sir.","Gaslight"
"970",5034170,5036260,"- A long time, you said?- Yes, sir.","Gaslight"
"971",5037039,5038869,"What do you think that means?","Gaslight"
"972",5038939,5042739,"From all you've told me these last weeks,I should say it could mean...","Gaslight"
"973",5042810,5045579,"any one of a numberof quite unpleasant things.","Gaslight"
"974",5047449,5050750,"- I've got to get into that house tonight.- Not while he's there.","Gaslight"
"975",5051090,5053050,"- He goes out every evening?- Right, sir.","Gaslight"
"976",5053119,5054250,"Tonight after dinner.","Gaslight"
"977",5054319,5057050,"Nancy says he's told hernot to let her mistress see anyone.","Gaslight"
"978",5057130,5060119,"Then you'll have to seethat Nancy isn't home tonight.","Gaslight"
"979",5060199,5064260,"- Any little thing I can do for the Yard, sir.- I thought you wouldn't mind.","Gaslight"
"980",5064569,5066189,"There's just one thing more though.","Gaslight"
"981",5066270,5068899,"How do you know the lady herselfwill see you?","Gaslight"
"982",5069710,5070930,"I don't know.","Gaslight"
"983",5072609,5073630,"Yes.","Gaslight"
"984",5075279,5077140,"I think there's a way.","Gaslight"

"1030",5306340,5309329,"He has taken a studiowhere he can work on his composing.","Gaslight"
"1031",5309409,5312779,"He can't work in this house.He has to have it quiet.","Gaslight"
"1032",5312880,5317510,"Tell me, is there anyone elsein the house now except us and Elizabeth?","Gaslight"
"1033",5319319,5322920,"- No. Why?- The gas just went down.","Gaslight"
"1034",5324890,5327159,"- You saw that, too?- Why, yes.","Gaslight"
"1035",5328659,5331500,"Then it really happens.I thought I imagined it.","Gaslight"
"1036",5331569,5334029,"That only meansthat someone else has turned it on.","Gaslight"
"1037",5334100,5337399,"I thought that, too, but every night,I've been all over the house...","Gaslight"
"1038",5337470,5340170,"and there's never beenanother light turned on.","Gaslight"
"1039",5340710,5344770,"At last I can tell this to someone.Every night when my husband goes out...","Gaslight"

"1043",5361000,5363260,"I watch and wait.","Gaslight"
"1044",5365329,5368460,"- Later on, the gas goes up again.- And he comes back.","Gaslight"
"1045",5370069,5372600,"Yes. Quite soon after.","Gaslight"
"1046",5373409,5374880,"Always quite soon after.","Gaslight"

"1057",5428560,5430590,"and then across the roof.","Gaslight"
"1058",5430770,5432029,"Why?","Gaslight"
"1059",5435300,5438569,"- You said there's old furniture up there.- My aunt's.","Gaslight"
"1060",5439369,5442640,"And her clothes, stage costumes, trunks,all of her things.","Gaslight"
"1061",5443750,5445180,"All of her things?","Gaslight"
"1062",5454220,5455689,"And they said the case was dead.","Gaslight"
"1063",5507180,5509640,"Tell me, has he any weapons in the house?","Gaslight"
"1064",5509939,5513710,"- He has a revolver. Why shouldn't he?- Do you know where he keeps it?","Gaslight"
"1065",5516220,5518579,"I think he has it in his desk in there.","Gaslight"
"1066",5527829,5529659,"You can't open his desk.","Gaslight"
"1067",5530399,5533729,"No. You have no right to.Whoever you are, you have no right to!","Gaslight"
"1068",5533800,5537760,"He'll know. He'll think that I...What should I say to him?","Gaslight"
"1069",5538039,5540029,"You won't have to say anything.","Gaslight"
"1070",5551090,5553949,"Perhaps it's a good thing I came tonight.","Gaslight"
"1071",5554060,5555579,"I was right.","Gaslight"
"1072",5557960,5559689,"There was a letter.","Gaslight"
"1073",5560430,5562520,"- And it was from Sergis Bauer.- What was that?","Gaslight"
"1074",5562600,5564760,"- What was that name you said?- Sergis Bauer.","Gaslight"
"1075",5564829,5568960,"I found this, but my husband saidI dreamed, and now it's here.","Gaslight"
"1076",5569039,5571600,"- Bauer.- It's been here the whole time.","Gaslight"
"1077",5571739,5575300,"There was a Sergis Bauerconnected with Alice Alquist.","Gaslight"
"1078",5577380,5581140,"He was a young pianist who playedfor her in Prague. Let me see that.","Gaslight"

"1086",5610409,5613239,"He said there was no letter,that I was going out of my mind!","Gaslight"
"1087",5613310,5616479,"No. You're slowly and systematicallybeing driven out of your mind.","Gaslight"
"1088",5616550,5617539,"Why?","Gaslight"
"1089",5617619,5620750,"Perhaps because you found this letterand know too much.","Gaslight"
"1090",5621060,5625390,"Or because then he would have controlof your property, of this house...","Gaslight"
"1091",5625989,5629260,"and could search in the openinstead of the dark like this.","Gaslight"
"1092",5629430,5631300,"Search? What is there to search for?","Gaslight"
"1093",5631369,5635100,"For the things for whichAlice Alquist was murdered: Her jewels.","Gaslight"

"1100",5652590,5653579,"Me.","Gaslight"
"1101",5662699,5665600,"So he was here that night, but he never...","Gaslight"
"1102",5665770,5667500,"He never knew her.","Gaslight"
"1103",5667739,5671539,"You're wrong. You're making a mistake.","Gaslight"
"1104",5672170,5674329,"I know him. He's my husband.","Gaslight"

"1110",5693029,5695500,"So you see, he must have plannedthe whole thing...","Gaslight"
"1111",5695560,5697460,"step by step from that night.","Gaslight"
"1112",5699699,5703689,"If that were true, then from the beginningthere would have been nothing.","Gaslight"
"1113",5705869,5708239,"Nothing real, from the beginning.","Gaslight"
"1114",5708380,5711369,"I'm sorry to take everything awayfrom you like this.","Gaslight"

"1122",5823260,5824989,"You can count on me, sir.","Gaslight"
"1123",5825159,5828460,"But what am I going to say to the masterwhen he comes back?","Gaslight"
"1124",5828600,5830890,"He won't come back anymore, Elizabeth.","Gaslight"

"1164",6152220,6153310,"I know it.","Gaslight"
"1165",6155220,6157520,"But he was here. I know it!","Gaslight"

"1176",6215250,6217810,"- My mind is going.- Haven't I told you?","Gaslight"
"1177",6217890,6219909,"- It was a dream.- Like all the rest.","Gaslight"

"1179",6222590,6225789,"It was a dream. Take me away.","Gaslight"
"1180",6226989,6230229,"Was I any part of this curious dreamof yours, Mrs. Anton?","Gaslight"
"1181",6232100,6233119,"You.","Gaslight"
"1182",6235500,6238439,"Perhaps my presence heremight help you to recall it.","Gaslight"
"1183",6238510,6240100,"Who the devil are you?","Gaslight"
"1184",6241239,6243939,"Apparently a mere figmentof your wife's imagination.","Gaslight"
"1185",6244010,6247810,"- How did you get into this house?- Through the skylight, like you...","Gaslight"
"1186",6250350,6253180,"and down these stairs.You made it very easy.","Gaslight"
"1187",6253390,6255319,"Will you tell me what you're doing here?","Gaslight"
"1188",6255390,6258520,"Mrs. Anton, I think you'd bettergo to bed. You must be tired.","Gaslight"
"1189",6258590,6260649,"You'd better explain your business, sir.","Gaslight"
"1190",6260729,6264359,"As a mere figment, as a mere ghostexisting in your wife's mind...","Gaslight"
"1191",6264430,6266960,"I could hardly be saidto have any business.","Gaslight"
"1192",6268039,6270029,"Paula, go to your room, please.","Gaslight"
"1193",6283550,6285380,"So you found them after all.","Gaslight"
"1194",6287560,6288920,"I was right about you.","Gaslight"
"1195",6288989,6292079,"I knew from the moment I saw youthat you were dangerous to me.","Gaslight"
"1196",6292159,6295489,"I knew from the first moment I saw youthat you were dangerous to her.","Gaslight"
"1197",6295560,6299470,"I should have followed my instinctabout you, as you followed yours.","Gaslight"
"1198",6299529,6301970,"I thought she was Alice Alquistcome back to life.","Gaslight"
"1199",6302039,6305699,"I didn't know then that she was walkingwith Sergis Bauer.","Gaslight"
"1200",6306569,6310029,"- I'm afraid I don't know your name.- Cameron. Want my address, too?","Gaslight"
"1201",6310109,6314050,"- No. I think I can guess it.- So we both ended our search tonight.","Gaslight"
"1202",6315350,6317180,"This is where Alice Alquist hid them.","Gaslight"
"1203",6317250,6320689,"Where the world could see them,yet no one would know where they were...","Gaslight"
"1204",6320750,6323850,"except the man who gave them to her,watching from the royal box.","Gaslight"
"1205",6323920,6328260,"Pretty clever of her to put four pricelessjewels among a lot of paste and tape.","Gaslight"
"1206",6328630,6332000,"- For the last time, what do you want?- The jewels, and justice.","Gaslight"
"1207",6332069,6336130,"How does it feel, Bauer, to have plannedand killed and tortured for something...","Gaslight"
"1208",6336199,6339470,"- and then to know it's been for nothing?- For nothing?","Gaslight"
"1209",6358289,6360920,"- What is it, ma'am?- I thought I heard a shot.","Gaslight"
"1210",6364600,6366729,"Help! Mr. Williams, come quick!","Gaslight"
"1211",6368500,6369560,"Up there!","Gaslight"
"1212",6386250,6387619,"Anybody at home?","Gaslight"
"1213",6432470,6434659,"Well, Mrs. Anton, you believe me now.","Gaslight"
"1214",6435670,6438039,"Perhaps you'd like to see these things.","Gaslight"
"1215",6438670,6441729,"They cost a woman's life.They cost you something, too.","Gaslight"
"1216",6457220,6461319,"- I want to speak to my husband.- Mrs. Anton, I don't think that's advisable.","Gaslight"
"1217",6461399,6464359,"- I want to speak to him alone.- I'm afraid that's impossible.","Gaslight"
"1218",6464430,6468199,"- I assure you, I'm quite helpless.- Please.","Gaslight"
"1219",6472210,6474140,"I'll be waiting on the stairs.","Gaslight"
"1220",6482520,6484680,"Go and see if he's listening.","Gaslight"
"1221",6488619,6492390,"- He is not listening.- You have got confidence in him.","Gaslight"
"1222",6492689,6495029,"- Did he tell you a lot of things about me?- Yes.","Gaslight"
"1223",6495100,6497289,"- They were lies.- Why should he lie to me?","Gaslight"
"1224",6497359,6500960,"Because he's in love with you.I can tell. I feel it.","Gaslight"
"1225",6501569,6505130,"Do you? Do you really, Gregory?Or shall I call you Sergis?","Gaslight"
"1226",6505569,6508300,"So he told you that, too. What of it?","Gaslight"
"1227",6508579,6512310,"Have you never heard of an artisttaking a stage name? Sergis Bauer's mine.","Gaslight"
"1228",6512380,6516149,"It was a part of my life I didn't care to tellyou about. I was a failure then.","Gaslight"
"1229",6516220,6520449,"- They don't hang a man for that, do they?- No, they don't hang a man for that.","Gaslight"
"1230",6522520,6525819,"You remember our first days.You remember Italy?","Gaslight"
"1231",6526029,6529479,"There have been timeswhen I thought I only dreamed those days.","Gaslight"
"1232",6530100,6531560,"Come closer, Paula.","Gaslight"
"1233",6535640,6536899,"Closer.","Gaslight"
"1234",6542109,6543510,"Look into my eyes.","Gaslight"
"1235",6544239,6547369,"If I ever meant anything to you,and I believe I did...","Gaslight"
"1236",6549119,6553020,"then help me, Paula.Give me another chance.","Gaslight"
"1237",6557829,6561630,"Look, in the drawer of that cupboardthere is a knife.","Gaslight"
"1238",6562260,6563890,"Get it and cut me free.","Gaslight"
"1239",6570869,6573739,"Be quick, Paula.Get me the knife. Cut me free.","Gaslight"
"1240",6575180,6577970,"Would you get it, Paula?Would you get it for me?","Gaslight"
"1241",6578750,6582310,"Yes, I'll get it. I'll get it for you.","Gaslight"
"1242",6583149,6584380,"Hurry, Paula.","Gaslight"
"1243",6587649,6589680,"- There's no knife here.- Yes. I put it there.","Gaslight"
"1244",6589760,6592489,"- I don't see any knife.- I put it there tonight.","Gaslight"
"1245",6592630,6595859,"No, it isn't here.You must have dreamed you put it there.","Gaslight"
"1246",6598100,6601229,"Are you suggesting that this is a knifeI hold in my hand?","Gaslight"
"1247",6601300,6603270,"Have you gone mad, my husband?","Gaslight"
"1248",6604340,6607329,"Or is it I who am mad?Yes, of course. That's it.","Gaslight"
"1249",6608180,6609470,"I am mad.","Gaslight"
"1250",6611579,6613739,"I'm always losing things and hiding things.","Gaslight"
"1251",6613810,6616310,"I can never find them.I don't know where I put them.","Gaslight"
"1252",6616380,6618819,"That was a knife, wasn't it?And I have lost it.","Gaslight"
"1253",6618890,6621289,"- Paula...- I must look for it, mustn't I?","Gaslight"
"1254",6621359,6624260,"If I don't find it,you will put me in the madhouse.","Gaslight"
"1255",6624420,6628289,"Where could it be, now?Perhaps it's behind this picture.","Gaslight"
"1256",6628359,6632489,"Yes, it must be here.No. Where shall I look now?","Gaslight"
"1257",6632569,6635630,"Perhaps I put it over here.Yes, I must have done that.","Gaslight"
"1258",6639340,6643069,"My broach. The broach I lost at the Tower.","Gaslight"
"1259",6644109,6647079,"I found it at last!You see? But it doesn't help you, does it?","Gaslight"
"1260",6647149,6649479,"And I'm trying to help you to escape,aren't I?","Gaslight"
"1261",6649550,6652109,"- How can a madwoman help you escape?- But you're not mad.","Gaslight"

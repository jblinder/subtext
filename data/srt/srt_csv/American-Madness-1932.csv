"233",826247,828363,"Hey, Pat, come here. Look!","American Madness"
"234",841807,844401,"That's Dude Finlay.I've seen his picture in the papers.","American Madness"
"235",844487,846876,"- I wonder what he's doing with Mr Cluett.- I'm scared.","American Madness"
"236",846967,849527,"He's one of the toughest gangsters in town.","American Madness"
"237",852767,855998,"Gentlemen, you're only wasting your time.There'll be no merger.","American Madness"
"238",856087,858203,"Why should I turn this bank overto anybody else?","American Madness"
"239",858287,859925,"I've worked 25 years to build it up","American Madness"
"240",860007,862123,"and now you ask meto dump it into somebody's lap.","American Madness"
"241",862207,863196,"Nothing doing.","American Madness"
"242",863287,865243,"You could make a handsome profiton your stock.","American Madness"
"243",865327,867887,"I'm not interested in profits.I'm interested in the bank.","American Madness"
"244",867967,869286,"The depositors are my friends.","American Madness"
"245",869367,871517,"They need my protection.I won't walk out on them.","American Madness"
"246",871607,874883,"How are you protecting your depositors?By making a lot of idiotic loans?","American Madness"
"247",874967,876002,"Take it easy, Clark.","American Madness"
"248",876087,877486,"- My dear friends...- It's all right.","American Madness"
"249",877567,879603,"Let him speak his piece. I like it. Go on.","American Madness"
"250",879687,881279,"All right, I'll speak my piece.","American Madness"
"251",881367,883437,"Dickson, you've got to change your policy.","American Madness"
"252",883527,885006,"What's the matter with my policy?","American Madness"
"253",885087,887647,"How many losses has this bank takenin the last 25 years?","American Madness"
"254",887727,889160,"I'll tell you, not a single one.","American Madness"
"255",889247,891477,"- What's wrong with that kind of banking?- Pure luck.","American Madness"
"256",891567,893842,"Conditions have changed.These are precarious times.","American Madness"
"257",893927,897636,"Banks today have got to be careful.And you've been more liberal than ever.","American Madness"
"258",897727,899445,"Yes, and I'll continue to be liberal.","American Madness"
"259",899527,902360,"The trouble with this country isthere's too much hoarded cash.","American Madness"
"260",902447,904119,"Idle money is no good to industry.","American Madness"
"261",904207,906641,"Where's all the money today? In the banks,","American Madness"
"262",906727,909639,"vaults, socks,old tin cans buried in the ground.","American Madness"
"263",909727,911843,"We've got to get the money in circulation","American Madness"
"264",911927,914043,"before you'll get this countryback to prosperity.","American Madness"
"265",914127,916243,"Who are we going to give it to?Men like Jones?","American Madness"
"266",916327,919876,"Last week you made him an extra loanof $50,000. Is that intelligent banking?","American Madness"
"267",919967,923084,"Can't pay his bills.How do you expect him to pay us?","American Madness"
"268",923167,925078,"That's a fair question, Schultz.","American Madness"
"269",925807,928879,"Let's see how bad a risk Jones is.What's his history?","American Madness"
"270",928967,931162,"He's been a successful businessmanfor 35 years.","American Madness"
"271",931247,933636,"Two years ago, business started falling off.","American Madness"
"272",933727,935126,"Today, Jones needs money.","American Madness"
"273",935207,937437,"And if he doesn't get it,he goes into bankruptcy","American Madness"
"274",937527,938880,"and throws 900 men out of work.","American Madness"
"275",938967,940685,"Answer: unemployment.","American Madness"
"276",941567,944400,"It also means his creditors aren't paid.They're in trouble.","American Madness"
"277",944487,947684,"They go to the banks and are turned down.More bankruptcies.","American Madness"
"278",947767,949246,"It's a vicious circle, my friends,","American Madness"
"279",949327,951887,"and the only place to cure itis right here at the source.","American Madness"
"280",951967,954322,"Help Jones and you help the whole circle.","American Madness"
"281",954447,956722,"When Jones comes to me,I ask myself two questions,","American Madness"
"282",956807,958957,"first, is he honest? Yes.","American Madness"
"283",959047,961356,"Second, is he as good a businessmanas he was before?","American Madness"
"284",961447,964359,"And the answer is, he's better.He is not only older and wiser","American Madness"
"285",964447,966961,"but his present troublehas taught him precaution.","American Madness"
"286",967047,970039,"In my estimation, gentlemen,Jones is no risk.","American Madness"
"287",970367,973120,"Neither are the thousands of other Jonesesacross the country.","American Madness"
"288",973207,975767,"It's they who made this nationthe richest in the world","American Madness"
"289",975847,978486,"and it's up to the banksto give them a break.","American Madness"
"290",980087,982601,"Disraeli said,""Security is the prosperity of a nation.""","American Madness"
"291",982687,984439,"Disraeli didn't say anything of the kind.","American Madness"
"292",984527,986518,"He should have.It's as true now as it was then.","American Madness"
"293",986607,988359,"But let's get the right kind of security.","American Madness"
"294",988447,990483,"Not stocks and bondsthat zigzag up and down.","American Madness"
"295",990567,992205,"Not collateral on paper, but character.","American Madness"
"296",992287,993686,"Character. That's your idea.","American Madness"
"297",993767,996964,"It's Alexander Hamilton's idea.The finest banking mind of this country.","American Madness"
"298",997047,998639,"Those were his exact words, gentlemen,","American Madness"
"299",998727,1000638,"""Character is the only thingyou can bank on","American Madness"
"300",1000727,1004356,"""and it's the only thing that'llpull this country out of the doldrums.""","American Madness"
"301",1009847,1012566,"You know what we do to welchers, Cluett,don't you?","American Madness"
"302",1012647,1014205,"I know, Dude.","American Madness"
"303",1014767,1017725,"I must have been crazy.I lost my head completely.","American Madness"
"304",1017967,1019525,"That's your funeral.","American Madness"
"305",1019607,1021484,"We've got $50,000 coming to us.","American Madness"
"306",1021567,1024604,"- I haven't got it.- Then what did you want to gamble for?","American Madness"
"307",1024687,1027838,"If you'd have beat us out of $50,000,you'd have been paid.","American Madness"
"308",1027967,1029764,"Well, we want our dough.","American Madness"
"309",1029847,1032281,"- I'm sorry, Dude, but I...- That don't do us any good.","American Madness"
"310",1032367,1035006,"After all, you can't take blood from a stone.","American Madness"
"311",1035087,1038318,"We can take blood from anythingif it's coming to us.","American Madness"
"312",1042127,1044561,"Perhaps if you'll wait a little while","American Madness"
"313",1044647,1046524,"- I might be able...- We've waited long enough.","American Madness"
"314",1046607,1047756,"Nix. Lay off.","American Madness"
"315",1047847,1050486,"What's the use of getting excited, Cluett?","American Madness"
"316",1050607,1054202,"It ought to be easy for youto lay your mitts on that kind of dough.","American Madness"
"317",1054287,1057484,"There's plenty of it in this banklaying around loose.","American Madness"
"318",1057887,1059479,"Good Heavens, man!","American Madness"
"319",1060287,1062642,"- You're not suggesting that I...- Why not?","American Madness"
"320",1062807,1065958,"- I couldn't do that.- You don't have to do nothing.","American Madness"
"321",1067847,1069405,"What do you mean?","American Madness"
"322",1069487,1072285,"All you gotta do is fix a few things for us","American Madness"
"323",1072847,1074838,"and we'll do the rest, see?","American Madness"
"324",1079727,1082764,"No. No, I couldn't.","American Madness"
"325",1084527,1086757,"I couldn't do anything like it.","American Madness"
"326",1092287,1093436,"All right.","American Madness"
"327",1093527,1095245,"- Good morning, Helen.- Good morning.","American Madness"

"330",1100247,1101566,"Board meeting?","American Madness"
"331",1103367,1104959,"That means hours, I suppose.","American Madness"
"332",1105047,1106241,"I'm afraid so.","American Madness"
"333",1106447,1109325,"Helen, did you ever trycompeting with a bank?","American Madness"
"334",1109447,1110436,"No.","American Madness"
"335",1110527,1113325,"Take my word for it, and don't try it.It's useless.","American Madness"
"336",1113567,1116035,"If it were another woman,I could handle her,","American Madness"
"337",1116127,1119085,"but after all, you can't scratcha bank's eyes out, now, can you?","American Madness"
"338",1119167,1120486,"Hardly.","American Madness"
"339",1120567,1122956,"Oh, well, I guessthe only other thing for me to do","American Madness"

"393",1305287,1309280,"I don't believe in it. The law demandsthat I carry a certain legal reserve, and I do.","American Madness"

"395",1312847,1315236,"Meanwhile, you're jeopardizingthe safety of the bank.","American Madness"

"397",1318967,1320241,"You'll have to stand for it.","American Madness"
"398",1320327,1321521,"But my dear friends...","American Madness"

"401",1325487,1328081,"I'm running this bank my way.Get that clear!","American Madness"
"402",1328407,1332002,"Gentlemen, you'll notice that Mr Dicksonrefuses to consider our wishes.","American Madness"
"403",1332087,1334476,"He refuses an offer to mergewith the New York Trust,","American Madness"
"404",1334567,1336762,"the only thing that'll put this bankon safe ground.","American Madness"

"410",1352047,1354686,"When I start going wrong,you won't have to take any action.","American Madness"
"411",1354767,1358043,"I'll turn the bank over to you,and then you can merge all you want to.","American Madness"
"412",1358127,1360402,"I won't be the fellow to run it then.","American Madness"
"413",1360727,1362399,"Good day, gentlemen.","American Madness"

"487",2686717,2689050,"You see, once their roomsare completed,","Winchester"
"488",2689052,2691054,"their presence grows stronger.","Winchester"
"489",2692454,2694324,"Hence, the housethat spirits built?","Winchester"
"490",2694623,2695659,"Yes.","Winchester"
"491",2696490,2698559,"The shadows that follow me,","Winchester"
"492",2698561,2701094,"they have unfinished business.","Winchester"
"493",2701097,2703934,"You saw what I did last night,didn't you?","Winchester"
"494",2704500,2705501,"I did.","Winchester"
"495",2707536,2709472,"At the chime of midnight,they clamor.","Winchester"
"496",2710574,2713641,"The bells summon them.","Winchester"
"497",2713643,2718612,"They communicatethrough plans, drawings.","Winchester"
"498",2718614,2722481,"They want me to reconstructthe rooms that they died in,","Winchester"
"499",2722483,2726054,"then they can enter our world.","Winchester"
"500",2726056,2727487,"And the trouble is,I don't always know","Winchester"
"501",2727489,2729123,"who it is I'm speaking with.","Winchester"
"502",2729126,2731661,"It could be someinnocent bystander","Winchester"
"503",2732695,2735666,"or a victim of a crime,","Winchester"
"504",2738333,2740202,"or someone else.","Winchester"
"505",2740204,2741706,"Who else, Mrs. Winchester?","Winchester"
"506",2743172,2746373,"Last night,a spirit more powerful","Winchester"
"507",2746375,2750581,"than any I've encounteredendangered my family.","Winchester"
"508",2752481,2754085,"Who are you?","Winchester"
"509",2755753,2760523,"Doctor, who do you seein this room at this moment?","Winchester"
"510",2761592,2762626,"Just you.","Winchester"
"511",2764094,2765494,"Only me?","Winchester"
"512",2774503,2775572,"Just you.","Winchester"
"513",2778108,2779775,"It will take time.","Winchester"
"514",2779777,2781679,"You still need to clearyour head.","Winchester"
"515",2802065,2803496,"Oh, sir!","Winchester"
"516",2803498,2804498,"I would like to check in","Winchester"
"517",2804500,2807101,"on Mrs. Marriottand Master Henry, if I may.","Winchester"
"518",2807103,2809070,"I will inquire, sir.","Winchester"
"519",2809072,2811208,"Perhaps, may Iask you a question?","Winchester"
"520",2812375,2813440,"A question, sir?","Winchester"
"521",2813442,2816311,"Yes. I mean, tell me,have you ever seen any...","Winchester"
"522",2817146,2818514,"Any ghosts?","Winchester"
"523",2819114,2820382,"No, sir.","Winchester"
"524",2821684,2824686,"But you have heardthe rumors, the stories?","Winchester"
"525",2824688,2828222,"I have heard tall tales.","Winchester"
"526",2828224,2831224,"Some taller than others.","Winchester"
"527",2831226,2833764,"Have you ever witnessedanything out of the ordinary?","Winchester"
"528",2841771,2844572,"So display cabinetsalong the walls,","Winchester"
"529",2844574,2846710,"and then a line of themdown the middle of the room.","Winchester"
"530",2847777,2848943,"Yes, ma'am.","Winchester"
"531",2848945,2852447,"And what type of Winchesterwould you like delivered?","Winchester"
"532",2854550,2857318,"Every type, every model.","Winchester"
"533",2859320,2861822,"Okay, let's go back.","Winchester"
"534",2861824,2865159,"Tell me please what happensonce these rooms are finished?","Winchester"
"535",2865161,2867228,"Well, the spirit'spresence grows","Winchester"
"536",2867230,2869230,"more powerful and more...","Winchester"
"537",2869231,2870864,"More focused.","Winchester"
"538",2870867,2872565,"Their voices get stronger.","Winchester"
"539",2872568,2873869,"And we converse.","Winchester"
"540",2873871,2876737,"Converse how?About what?","Winchester"
"541",2876739,2880708,"I show them my deep remorse.","Winchester"
"542",2880710,2884376,"I want to help them let go oftheir grief and their anger.","Winchester"
"543",2884378,2885679,"And how do they react?","Winchester"
"544",2885681,2889184,"Favorably. Yes, mostly.","Winchester"
"545",2889186,2891483,"Once they are at peace,then they can move on.","Winchester"
"546",2891485,2895222,"We can tear down their room,and then we start again.","Winchester"
"547",2895224,2898161,"And are there those thatdon't react so favorably?","Winchester"
"548",2899594,2901394,"Yes.","Winchester"
"549",2901396,2903797,"Yes, we lock them away.","Winchester"
"550",2903800,2905833,"How does one lock a spirit away?","Winchester"
"551",2905835,2908670,"Thirteen nails seals them in.","Winchester"
"552",2908672,2910905,"Once they find peace,we can release them,","Winchester"
"553",2910907,2912806,"and they can leave this house.","Winchester"
"554",2912809,2914375,"So 13 is","Winchester"
"555",2914376,2916376,"a devilish number toprotect you from devils?","Winchester"
"556",2916378,2919244,"No, no, no.That is a divine number,","Winchester"
"557",2919246,2921815,"to protect the cycleof life and death.","Winchester"
"558",2921818,2923684,"And does this divine numberalways work?","Winchester"
"559",2923686,2928125,"I mean, what if a spirit simplydoesn't want to be locked away?","Winchester"
"560",2929626,2931726,"The unmendable souls","Winchester"
"561",2931728,2935327,"prey upon the innocentand the pure.","Winchester"
"562",2935329,2938135,"And by the innocent and pure,you mean Master Henry?","Winchester"
"563",2941302,2942905,"We can stand between them.","Winchester"
"564",2943773,2945541,"I and you.","Winchester"
"565",2946543,2948275,"With your assistance,","Winchester"
"566",2948277,2951181,"I can help this spiritfind peace.","Winchester"
"567",2956619,2958887,"You don't believe any of this.I understand.","Winchester"
"568",2958889,2960621,"Ma'am, I do not.","Winchester"
"569",2960623,2965726,"I do not believe in anythingI cannot see or study.","Winchester"
"570",2965728,2967963,"Mrs. Winchester,you have built this house,","Winchester"
"571",2967965,2969929,"this place, this reality.","Winchester"
"572",2969931,2972333,"Therefore, you can control it,can you not?","Winchester"
"573",2973235,2974936,"Yes, perhaps.","Winchester"
"574",2974938,2976402,"We all have the ability","Winchester"
"575",2976403,2978572,"to create and controlour own reality.","Winchester"
"576",2978574,2981976,"But for some, for you,Mrs. Winchester, for you,","Winchester"
"577",2981978,2983813,"that will mean letting goof the past.","Winchester"
"578",2985447,2987552,"Make your assessment, Doctor.","Winchester"
"579",2989552,2993755,"Say what you feel is the truthabout Sarah Winchester.","Winchester"
"580",2993757,2996226,"And if that means you losecontrol of your company?","Winchester"
"581",2997760,3001396,"There are worse things in thisworld to lose than that, Doctor.","Winchester"
"582",3008704,3010063,"I see you've finishedthe new room.","Winchester"
"583",3011041,3013041,"Of course.","Winchester"
"584",3013043,3014777,"Must be very profitable for you,","Winchester"
"585",3015911,3018579,"all this workinground the clock.","Winchester"
"586",3018581,3020313,"We all appreciate","Winchester"
"587",3020315,3023317,"Mrs. Winchester'songoing employment","Winchester"
"588",3023318,3024922,"and her creativity.","Winchester"
"589",3025856,3027320,"I must say, that creativity","Winchester"
"590",3027322,3030824,"certainly leads to somerather odd designs.","Winchester"
"591",3030827,3033326,"Do you think it possiblea woman of advancing years","Winchester"
"592",3033327,3035996,"may be susceptibleto flights of fancy?","Winchester"
"593",3035998,3038668,"No, sir. I do not.","Winchester"
"594",3042039,3044838,"Could I see insidethe garden room, please?","Winchester"
"595",3044840,3046675,"I had one similar, and I wouldbe much obliged if...","Winchester"
"596",3046677,3048878,"No, sir. That room is sealed.","Winchester"
"597",3050047,3052016,"Therefore, it's off limits.","Winchester"
"598",3052715,3054719,"Good day, Doctor.","Winchester"
"599",3059922,3062590,"Well, Eric,that's going really well.","Winchester"
"600",3076672,3077775,"How is he?","Winchester"
"601",3078940,3080974,"Fine. Resting.","Winchester"
"602",3080976,3083913,"Has he ever been prone tobehavior like that in the past?","Winchester"
"603",3084581,3085813,"No.","Winchester"
"604",3085815,3086882,"Never?","Winchester"
"605",3089786,3093623,"She told you, didn't she,about the Winchester curse?","Winchester"
"606",3093922,3095621,"Yes.","Winchester"
"607",3095623,3098391,"Do you believe her,or do you think she's crazy?","Winchester"
"608",3098393,3101728,"I think crazyis a dangerous word.","Winchester"
"609",3101731,3103898,"People have certainmedical conditions","Winchester"
"610",3103900,3106534,"and with the rightdiagnosis and treatment,","Winchester"
"611",3106536,3107938,"they can be helped.","Winchester"
"612",3112576,3114811,"I do not believein curses, Doctor.","Winchester"
"613",3115643,3117878,"Good. Nor do I.","Winchester"
"614",3117880,3119813,"I think perhapsyour son's behavior","Winchester"
"615",3119815,3122483,"has been triggered by thesudden death of his father.","Winchester"
"616",3122985,3124818,"Yes.","Winchester"
"617",3124820,3127356,"Could you tell mehow your husband died?","Winchester"
"618",3127791,3130090,"He had demons,","Winchester"
"619",3130092,3134065,"but not the kind that my auntbelieves haunt her.","Winchester"
"620",3136900,3138800,"Go on.","Winchester"
"621",3138802,3142835,"Aunt Sarah's husbanddied suddenly of tuberculosis.","Winchester"
"622",3142838,3145041,"And then she lost poor Annie.","Winchester"
"623",3146610,3149079,"She believes our family curseis spreading.","Winchester"
"624",3159556,3162023,"My husband loved the drink","Winchester"
"625",3162025,3164525,"more than his wife and child.","Winchester"
"626",3164527,3166463,"I believe that was his curse.","Winchester"
"627",3168431,3172666,"Now he is gone, and I'm alone,","Winchester"
"628",3172668,3174739,"better off in so many wayswithout him.","Winchester"
"629",3176503,3178005,"But it terrifies me.","Winchester"
"630",3178007,3180476,"Don't let that fear control you.","Winchester"
"631",3181610,3183880,"Fear only exists in your mind.","Winchester"
"632",3184947,3187014,"When we fear the most,","Winchester"
"633",3187016,3189949,"we must take control.","Winchester"
"634",3189952,3192686,"You can be a fighter.You can be a protector.","Winchester"
"635",3192688,3194757,"I do not feel like a protector.","Winchester"
"636",3195992,3197594,"Aunt Sarah is the fighter.","Winchester"
"637",3199195,3201097,"- Yes.- She would die to save us.","Winchester"
"638",3201864,3203530,"Perhaps.","Winchester"
"639",3203532,3206467,"Have you ever loved someone somuch you would die to save them?","Winchester"
"640",3208503,3210670,"I have.","Winchester"
"641",3210672,3216577,"I also knew someone who washaunted by demons, voices.","Winchester"
"642",3216579,3219548,"And did the time ever comewhen you had to protect them?","Winchester"
"643",3220217,3221719,"It did.","Winchester"
"644",3223619,3224887,"What did you do?","Winchester"
"645",3226755,3227958,"I died.","Winchester"
"646",3253717,3254818,"Henry!","Winchester"
"647",3255885,3256887,"Ahh!","Winchester"
"648",3260922,3261925,"Henry.","Winchester"
"649",3262523,3263590,"Henry!","Winchester"
"650",3278806,3280041,"Henry.","Winchester"
"651",3280043,3281811,"Henry! It's me!","Winchester"
"652",3309873,3310907,"No.","Winchester"
"653",3311608,3313210,"Ah!","Winchester"
"654",3318914,3320884,"Henry! Henry!","Winchester"
"655",3322184,3325588,"- Henry! Henry!- Stop it! Stop!","Winchester"
"656",3326121,3327286,"Stop, Henry, stop!","Winchester"
"657",3327288,3329291,"- Who are you?- Die!","Winchester"
"658",3340936,3342005,"Mother?","Winchester"
"659",3343940,3345974,"Oh, Henry.","Winchester"
"660",3345976,3347744,"Henry. Henry.","Winchester"
"661",3355784,3357083,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.","Winchester"
"662",3357085,3358753,"I've let you down,and I've let Henry down.","Winchester"
"663",3358755,3361121,"No, no.","Winchester"
"664",3361123,3364289,"This spirit has a powerwe've not seen before.","Winchester"
"665",3364291,3365996,"Oh, my God.","Winchester"
"666",3366862,3368731,"It can take over a mind.","Winchester"
"667",3371264,3373365,"John, send everyone home.","Winchester"
"668",3373367,3375335,"Only we in this roommust remain.","Winchester"
"669",3375336,3376434,"Yes, ma'am.","Winchester"
"670",3376436,3379139,"This child must be takento a hospital immediately.","Winchester"

"672",3380809,3381943,"To a hospital immediately.","Winchester"
"673",3381945,3383677,"No. No one elsewill understand.","Winchester"
"674",3383679,3385079,"- He must stay here.- This is insanity.","Winchester"
"675",3385081,3386213,"We will watch over him.","Winchester"
"676",3386215,3388018,"Dr. Price may be right.","Winchester"
"677",3388952,3390851,"No. No. We will protect him.","Winchester"
"678",3390853,3392351,"We will protect himat all costs.","Winchester"
"679",3392353,3393655,"John, come with me.","Winchester"
"680",3393657,3394858,"Aunt Sarah!","Winchester"

"687",3417244,3419413,"You speak with me.","Winchester"
"688",3426387,3428320,"Let's just think this through.","Winchester"
"689",3428322,3430257,"Please, Mrs. Marriott,be rational.","Winchester"
"690",3430259,3432927,"Henry clearly has a traumaand needs help.","Winchester"
"691",3432929,3434326,"Your aunt is caughtin a superstition.","Winchester"
"692",3434327,3435862,"We need...","Winchester"

"698",3493523,3495088,"Oh, I feel its hatred...","Winchester"
"699",3495090,3496224,"Oh, enough with the games!","Winchester"
"700",3496226,3498159,"We're taking this boyto a hospital.","Winchester"

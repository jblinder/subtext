"443",2132422,2133672,"You know, I'm tired.","Notorious"
"444",2133840,2137301,"The worst thing about businessis it makes you feel old and look old.","Notorious"
"445",2137636,2139053,"You seem to have escaped all of that.","Notorious"
"446",2139220,2141722,"Four years of dullnessand disintegration.","Notorious"
"447",2141890,2142890,"Awful.","Notorious"
"448",2143058,2145476,"Alex, you look youngerthan you did in Washington.","Notorious"
"449",2145644,2148979,"It's a temporary improvemententirely due to your presence, my dear.","Notorious"
"450",2149147,2150898,"You always affected me like a tonic.","Notorious"
"451",2152233,2153817,"Perhaps now, with you here in Rio,","Notorious"
"452",2153985,2157112,"unless you insiston running away from me again.","Notorious"
"453",2158740,2160324,"- Would you like another drink?- Yes, thank you.","Notorious"
"454",2169793,2171168,"You know him?","Notorious"
"455",2172212,2174171,"No, I don't think so,but he seems familiar.","Notorious"
"456",2174339,2176131,"Captain Prescott. Intelligence man.","Notorious"
"457",2176299,2178300,"He's down hereas part of the Washington espionage.","Notorious"
"458",2178468,2180636,"The American Embassy'sloaded with them.","Notorious"
"459",2180804,2181804,"Really?","Notorious"
"460",2183807,2185307,"He's rather handsome, isn't he?","Notorious"
"461",2185475,2187893,"I'm allergic to American agents.","Notorious"
"462",2188561,2190896,"Their fine pointsdon't particularly appeal to me.","Notorious"
"463",2191064,2193691,"They've bothered yousince you came down?","Notorious"
"464",2193858,2195943,"No, not yet.","Notorious"
"465",2197112,2199113,"They were troublesome in Miami?","Notorious"
"466",2200865,2204410,"Yes, that's why I left after the trial,to get away from their snooping.","Notorious"
"467",2205578,2208080,"I wondered why you left your father.","Notorious"
"468",2209666,2211667,"He insisted. He was so unselfish.","Notorious"
"469",2211835,2214795,"He kept worrying about me,begging me to leave.","Notorious"
"470",2215964,2217965,"I had no idea he was going to die.","Notorious"
"471",2218133,2222469,"Many things have died for all of us.We mustn't let our spirit die with them.","Notorious"
"472",2225432,2227641,"Perhaps I can help you to forget.I'd like to.","Notorious"
"473",2228768,2230185,"It's odd,","Notorious"
"474",2232272,2235023,"but I feel at home with you.","Notorious"
"475",2235650,2240154,"You know, my dear,I knew this was going to happen.","Notorious"
"476",2240321,2243490,"I knew, when we met the other day","Notorious"
"477",2243658,2245909,"that if I saw you again,I'd feel what I used to for you.","Notorious"
"478",2247537,2249037,"The same hunger.","Notorious"
"479",2250540,2252332,"You're so lovely, my dear.","Notorious"
"480",2253960,2255961,"Now I'm going to makea fool of myself again.","Notorious"
"481",2256129,2259006,"There's someone else, of course.Who is it this time?","Notorious"
"482",2259174,2261341,"That Mr. Devlin you were with?","Notorious"
"483",2261509,2263635,"There is no one.","Notorious"
"484",2263803,2265512,"He seemed attentive.","Notorious"
"485",2267599,2270809,"Mr. Devlin has pestered me with hisattentiveness ever since I arrived.","Notorious"
"486",2270977,2273061,"I met him on a plane from Miami.","Notorious"
"487",2273229,2274313,"You made a pretty couple.","Notorious"
"488",2274481,2278525,"Oh, no, Alex.Mr. Devlin doesn't interest me.","Notorious"
"489",2279903,2284156,"I was so lonely that day, I could havegone riding with Peter Rabbit.","Notorious"
"490",2285950,2287910,"You'll let me help your loneliness?","Notorious"
"491",2290497,2294374,"You're very sweet to forgetwhat a brat I was once.","Notorious"

"497",2310558,2312017,"She won't mind an extra guest?","Notorious"
"498",2312185,2315020,"An old friend is never an extra guest.","Notorious"
"499",2317816,2321068,"- Well, should we order now?- Yes, I'm starved.","Notorious"
"500",2322570,2324655,"Now, let's see.","Notorious"

"572",2631754,2633380,"He's very sentimental.","Notorious"
"573",2636843,2639678,"It takes nearly as longto go from the city to the airport,","Notorious"
"574",2639846,2641805,"as it does to cross the...","Notorious"
"575",2655570,2658321,"I'm afraid, gentlemen,that something must be done about Emil.","Notorious"
"576",2659365,2661408,"I don't know.","Notorious"
"577",2661576,2664411,"It was an understandable slip.The man was tired.","Notorious"
"578",2664579,2667455,"No. But it was a very dangerous slip.","Notorious"
"579",2667623,2670792,"It's not the first one. There have beenseveral other lapses before.","Notorious"
"580",2670960,2673336,"There will be more if you permit him.","Notorious"
"581",2673504,2676047,"That's bad. That's very bad.","Notorious"
"582",2676215,2678633,"I think, gentlemen,you can leave it to me to find some way.","Notorious"
"583",2678801,2682512,"When you drive up to Petr�polis,the road winds quite a bit.","Notorious"
"584",2682680,2684389,"It is very high.","Notorious"
"585",2684557,2687017,"There are some very awkward turns.","Notorious"
"586",2687935,2691938,"I'm sure I will not have any difficultyin getting Emil to give me a lift.","Notorious"
"587",2692106,2694191,"It's quite a trick to jump clear.","Notorious"
"588",2695484,2697611,"I'll just have to be careful,that is all.","Notorious"
"589",2698654,2700864,"Turned my ankle the last time.","Notorious"
"590",2710750,2715420,"Madame says will you join the others,or will you take your coffee in here?","Notorious"
"591",2715588,2718381,"I think we'll take coffee in here, Emil.","Notorious"
"592",2720092,2722594,"I'm very sorry, gentlemen,","Notorious"
"593",2722762,2724679,"to make such an exhibition.","Notorious"
"594",2724847,2727891,"Nonsense. We all have nerves.","Notorious"
"595",2728726,2730644,"You have been overworking.","Notorious"

"601",2744784,2747244,"Alex, for my leaving so early, then I...","Notorious"
"602",2747411,2750622,"Maybe, Emil, it would be betterif I came with you.","Notorious"
"603",2750790,2753833,"Perhaps if you tried to drive yourselfall the way up to Petr�polis,","Notorious"
"604",2754001,2756211,"it might be too much for you.","Notorious"
"605",2756379,2758213,"I shall drive you.","Notorious"
"606",2758506,2759881,"No.","Notorious"
"607",2760049,2762801,"That would be too much for you.All that way, it is too much to ask.","Notorious"
"608",2762969,2765262,"Nonsense. I'd love to go.","Notorious"
"609",2765429,2767472,"Come on, Emil.","Notorious"
"610",2767640,2769099,"Good night, gentlemen.","Notorious"

"617",2783155,2786491,"And please tell your mother for methat the dessert was superb.","Notorious"
"618",2798504,2800672,"Miss Huberman has been gonea long time.","Notorious"
"619",2800840,2804134,"Mother, is it necessary for you toalways address Alicia as Miss Huberman?","Notorious"
"620",2804302,2806303,"I do wish you'd bea little more cordial to her.","Notorious"
"621",2806470,2808805,"Really? I thought I was behavingvery well.","Notorious"
"622",2808973,2811099,"- Has she been complaining about me?- No.","Notorious"
"623",2811267,2812434,"I'm grateful.","Notorious"
"624",2812601,2814394,"You might smile at her.","Notorious"
"625",2814562,2817856,"Wouldn't it be a little too muchif we both grinned at her like idiots?","Notorious"
"626",2818024,2819774,"Please, Mother, I want to enjoy myself.","Notorious"
"627",2819942,2823862,"- Is it so boring to sit with me alone?- Not at all.","Notorious"

"671",2951907,2954075,"- You're rotten.- That's why I didn't try to stop you.","Notorious"

"673",2957621,2958621,"That's right.","Notorious"
"674",2960291,2961666,"You never believed in me, anyway,","Notorious"
"675",2961834,2964294,"- so what's the difference?- Lucky for both of us I didn't.","Notorious"
"676",2964462,2967088,"It wouldn't have been pretty if I hadbelieved in you, if I'd figured,","Notorious"
"677",2967256,2970675,"""She'd never go through with this,she's been made over by love.""","Notorious"
"678",2971343,2975430,"If you only once had saidthat you love me. Oh, Dev.","Notorious"

"684",2989487,2991779,"Dry your eyes, baby.It's out of character.","Notorious"
"685",2991947,2994824,"Except keep on your toes,it's a tough job we're on.","Notorious"

"698",3027066,3028775,"Don't be absurd.","Notorious"

"702",3036534,3039661,"I thought maybe you're in love with him.","Notorious"
"703",3039828,3042580,"- Don't talk like that, I detest him.- Really?","Notorious"
"704",3043624,3046209,"- He's very good-looking.- Alex,","Notorious"
"705",3046377,3049337,"I've told you before.Mr. Devlin doesn't mean a thing to me.","Notorious"
"706",3049505,3051297,"I'd like to be convinced.","Notorious"
"707",3052174,3054300,"Would you, maybe,care to convince me, Alicia,","Notorious"
"708",3054468,3057011,"that Mr. Devlin means nothing to you?","Notorious"
"709",3061267,3064727,"Pleased to hear, Se�or Barbosa, that ourlittle theatrical plan is working.","Notorious"
"710",3064895,3067105,"We've got hold of something concretefor a change.","Notorious"
"711",3067273,3069274,"I'm delighted, gentlemen. What is it?","Notorious"
"712",3069441,3072735,"Professor Wilhelm Otto Renzeleris working here in Brazil.","Notorious"

"727",3109273,3112525,"Miss Huberman is first, last,and always not a lady.","Notorious"
"728",3112693,3115903,"She may be risking her life,but when it comes to being a lady,","Notorious"
"729",3116071,3119991,"she doesn't hold a candle to your wife,sitting in Washington, playing bridge","Notorious"

"739",3145726,3147477,"I promise not to break the rules again.","Notorious"
"740",3147645,3150521,"But I need some advice,and I couldn't find Mr. Devlin.","Notorious"

"748",3177341,3178466,"Yes, if you wish.","Notorious"
"749",3180260,3181719,"What do you think of this, Devlin?","Notorious"
"750",3183764,3185723,"I think it's a useful idea.","Notorious"
"751",3185891,3189435,"Well, you know the situationbetter than any of us.","Notorious"
"752",3189603,3192980,"May I ask what inspiredAlex Sebastian to go this far?","Notorious"
"753",3194316,3195733,"He is in love with me.","Notorious"
"754",3197111,3198736,"And he thinks you're in love with him?","Notorious"
"755",3201990,3203366,"Yes, that's what he thinks.","Notorious"
"756",3203534,3206077,"Gentlemen,it's the cream of the jest.","Notorious"
"757",3209498,3212875,"Then... Then it's all right?","Notorious"
"758",3215295,3217213,"Yes, I'd say so.","Notorious"
"759",3217965,3221259,"Of course,it's a perfect marriage for us.","Notorious"
"760",3221427,3223928,"There's only one thing,won't it delay us a bit?","Notorious"
"761",3224096,3225638,"What do you mean?","Notorious"
"762",3226056,3229600,"Mr. Sebastian is a very romantic fellow,isn't he, Alicia?","Notorious"
"763",3231353,3232437,"Yes.","Notorious"
"764",3232730,3236190,"Then he'll probably want to takehis bride away for a long honeymoon.","Notorious"
"765",3236358,3237483,"Won't that hold us up?","Notorious"
"766",3238068,3239944,"- Devlin's got a point there.- I don't know,","Notorious"
"767",3240112,3243322,"I think we can rely on Miss Hubermanto get back into the house quickly.","Notorious"
"768",3245576,3247577,"Yes, I think I can manage that.","Notorious"
"769",3249288,3251289,"Everything seems to be nicely arranged.","Notorious"
"770",3251457,3254000,"I don't think you need me here anymore,do you, Captain Prescott?","Notorious"
"771",3255836,3259338,"I do want to thank you,Miss Huberman, very much.","Notorious"

"775",3268724,3271225,"To capture the rich Alex Sebastianfor a husband?","Notorious"
"776",3271393,3273561,"Don't be absurd, Mother,she didn't even know I was here.","Notorious"
"777",3273729,3277857,"- We will discuss it more fully tonight.- We will not discuss it tonight.","Notorious"
"778",3284114,3285615,"You know, all these carping questions","Notorious"
"779",3285783,3287450,"are merely the expressionof your own jealousy,","Notorious"
"780",3287618,3289243,"just as you've always been jealousof any woman","Notorious"
"781",3289411,3290661,"I've ever shown any interest in.","Notorious"
"782",3290829,3292747,"In this case,there's nothing more to discuss.","Notorious"

"795",3362192,3363401,"That's all right, Alex.","Notorious"
"796",3363569,3366404,"Well, what shall we do? Shall we haveJoseph arrange for food for us?","Notorious"
"797",3366572,3368781,"Not unless you want to.I'm rather tired myself.","Notorious"

"802",3382212,3385172,"- Joseph, did you have the closets aired?- Yes, madame.","Notorious"
"803",3391471,3394390,"This isn't very large.I'll need more room.","Notorious"
"804",3404192,3405443,"This door is locked.","Notorious"

"845",3577324,3579742,"like the one that rattledthe fellow at dinner that night.","Notorious"
"846",3580619,3583996,"All the bottles look alike to me.I'm no mastermind.","Notorious"
"847",3585123,3586957,"You're doing all right.","Notorious"

"851",3600722,3604350,"so he can introduce his brideto Rio society, say sometime next week?","Notorious"
"852",3604518,3605601,"Why?","Notorious"
"853",3605769,3607478,"Consider me invited,","Notorious"

"861",3632921,3635923,"and I saw how happily married you were,","Notorious"
"862",3636091,3639969,"then the horrid passion I have for youmight be torn out of me.","Notorious"

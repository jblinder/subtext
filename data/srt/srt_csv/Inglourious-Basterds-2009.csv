"2",461711,465380,"I have no way of knowing ifyou are familiar with who I am.","Inglourious Basterds"
"3",466298,468550,"Are you awareof my existence?","Inglourious Basterds"
"4",469552,470552,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"5",470637,471720,"This is good.","Inglourious Basterds"
"6",472305,477007,"Now, are you aware of the jobI've been ordered to carry out in France?","Inglourious Basterds"
"7",478728,479769,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"8",480437,482439,"Please tell mewhat you've heard.","Inglourious Basterds"
"9",483399,484733,"I've heard","Inglourious Basterds"
"10",485276,489572,"that the Führer has put you in chargeof rounding up the Jews left in France","Inglourious Basterds"
"11",489656,492574,"who are either hidingor passing for Gentile.","Inglourious Basterds"
"12",494035,496911,"The Führer couldn't havesaid it better himself.","Inglourious Basterds"
"13",498874,502500,"But the meaningof your visit,","Inglourious Basterds"
"14",502961,507173,"pleasant though it is,is mysterious to me.","Inglourious Basterds"
"15",508841,512094,"The Germans looked through my housenine months ago for hiding Jews","Inglourious Basterds"
"16",512178,513846,"and found nothing.","Inglourious Basterds"
"17",515599,517265,"I'm aware of that.","Inglourious Basterds"
"18",517767,520269,"I've read the reportsof this area.","Inglourious Basterds"
"19",522272,525481,"But like any enterprise,when under new management,","Inglourious Basterds"
"20",525567,528652,"there is always a slightduplication of efforts,","Inglourious Basterds"
"21",529904,534575,"most of it being a complete waste oftime, but needs to be done nevertheless.","Inglourious Basterds"
"22",535576,538620,"I just have a few questions,monsieur LaPadite.","Inglourious Basterds"
"23",540123,542374,"If you can assist mewith answers,","Inglourious Basterds"
"24",542458,545586,"my department can closethe file on your family.","Inglourious Basterds"
"25",554053,555221,"Now,","Inglourious Basterds"
"26",556889,561143,"before the occupation, there werefour Jewish families in this area,","Inglourious Basterds"
"27",561727,564062,"all dairy farmerslike yourself.","Inglourious Basterds"
"28",565899,570485,"Doleracs, Rollins,the Loveitts","Inglourious Basterds"
"29",572322,573989,"and the Dreyfuses.","Inglourious Basterds"
"30",574157,575698,"Is that correct?","Inglourious Basterds"
"31",575783,576783,"To my knowledge,","Inglourious Basterds"
"32",576868,580328,"those were the Jewish familiesamong the dairy farmers.","Inglourious Basterds"
"33",580496,584332,"Herr Colonel, would it disturbyou if I smoked my pipe?","Inglourious Basterds"
"34",584417,585875,"Please,monsieur LaPadite,","Inglourious Basterds"
"35",585961,588962,"this is your house,make yourself comfortable.","Inglourious Basterds"
"36",589297,592258,"Now, accordingto these papers,","Inglourious Basterds"
"37",593176,596595,"all the Jewish families in thisarea have been accounted for","Inglourious Basterds"
"38",596679,599514,"except the Dreyfuses.","Inglourious Basterds"
"39",600975,604394,"Somewhere in the last year itwould appear they've vanished.","Inglourious Basterds"
"40",604479,607773,"Which leads me to the conclusion thatthey've either made good their escape","Inglourious Basterds"
"41",607856,610775,"or someone is verysuccessfully hiding them.","Inglourious Basterds"
"42",611986,615614,"What have you heard about theDreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?","Inglourious Basterds"
"43",615698,616657,"Only rumors.","Inglourious Basterds"
"44",616740,618033,"I love rumors!","Inglourious Basterds"
"45",619619,620952,"Facts could beso misleading,","Inglourious Basterds"
"46",621037,624206,"where rumors, true or false,are often revealing.","Inglourious Basterds"
"47",624624,626082,"So, monsieur LaPadite,","Inglourious Basterds"
"48",626167,629419,"what rumors have you heardregarding the Dreyfuses?","Inglourious Basterds"
"49",632256,635384,"Again,this is just a rumor,","Inglourious Basterds"
"50",635467,641764,"but we heard the Dreyfuseshad made their way into Spain.","Inglourious Basterds"
"51",649649,652359,"So, the rumors you've heardhave been of escape?","Inglourious Basterds"
"52",654070,655153,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"53",658741,662494,"Having never met the Dreyfuses,would you confirm for me","Inglourious Basterds"
"54",662578,665873,"the exact members of thehousehold and their names?","Inglourious Basterds"
"55",671296,673254,"There werefive of them.","Inglourious Basterds"
"56",675466,678134,"The father, Jacob.","Inglourious Basterds"
"57",680013,682514,"Wife, Miram.","Inglourious Basterds"
"58",684558,688144,"And her brother, Bob.","Inglourious Basterds"
"59",695403,696945,"How old is Bob?","Inglourious Basterds"
"60",698572,699907,"Thirty, 31.","Inglourious Basterds"
"61",704162,705412,"Continue.","Inglourious Basterds"
"62",705788,707413,"And the children,","Inglourious Basterds"
"63",709125,710250,"Amos","Inglourious Basterds"
"64",712336,713796,"and Shosanna.","Inglourious Basterds"
"65",715965,717799,"Ages of the children?","Inglourious Basterds"
"66",724890,728476,"Amos was nine or 10.","Inglourious Basterds"
"67",731313,732605,"And Shosanna?","Inglourious Basterds"
"68",732690,734817,"And Shosanna was","Inglourious Basterds"
"69",736485,740279,"18 or 19.I'm not really sure.","Inglourious Basterds"
"70",751125,753460,"Well, I guessthat should do it.","Inglourious Basterds"
"71",759842,764263,"However, before I go, could I haveanother glass of your delicious milk?","Inglourious Basterds"
"72",767307,768808,"But of course.","Inglourious Basterds"
"73",775567,777609,"Monsieur LaPadite,","Inglourious Basterds"
"74",777693,781697,"are you aware of the nickname thepeople of France have given me?","Inglourious Basterds"
"75",785326,787744,"I have no interestin such things.","Inglourious Basterds"
"76",788788,791498,"But you are awareof what they call me.","Inglourious Basterds"
"77",794043,795376,"I'm aware.","Inglourious Basterds"
"78",797129,799005,"What are you aware of?","Inglourious Basterds"
"79",808892,810433,"That they call you""The Jew Hunter.""","Inglourious Basterds"
"80",810518,812059,"Precisely.","Inglourious Basterds"
"81",814397,817024,"I understand yourtrepidation in repeating it.","Inglourious Basterds"
"82",817107,819400,"Heydrich apparentlyhates the moniker","Inglourious Basterds"
"83",819485,822153,"the good people of Praguehave bestowed on him.","Inglourious Basterds"
"84",822238,825490,"Actually, why he would hate thename ""the Hangman"" is baffling to me.","Inglourious Basterds"
"85",825575,828911,"It would appear he has doneeverything in his power to earn it.","Inglourious Basterds"
"86",828995,832246,"Now I, on the other hand,love my unofficial title","Inglourious Basterds"
"87",832331,834750,"precisely becauseI've earned it.","Inglourious Basterds"
"88",836168,840214,"The feature that makes me such aneffective hunter of the Jews is,","Inglourious Basterds"
"89",840298,843008,"as opposed to mostGerman soldiers,","Inglourious Basterds"
"90",843091,845092,"I can think like a Jew","Inglourious Basterds"
"91",845761,848471,"where they can onlythink like a German.","Inglourious Basterds"
"92",848847,851265,"More precisely,a German soldier.","Inglourious Basterds"
"93",857941,862903,"Now, if one were to determine what attributethe German people share with a beast,","Inglourious Basterds"
"94",863446,866990,"it would be the cunning and thepredatory instinct of a hawk.","Inglourious Basterds"
"95",867450,871286,"But if one were to determine whatattributes the Jews share with a beast,","Inglourious Basterds"
"96",871370,873496,"it would bethat of the rat.","Inglourious Basterds"
"97",876292,880128,"The Führer and Goebbels' propagandahave said pretty much the same thing.","Inglourious Basterds"
"98",880212,883215,"But where our conclusionsdiffer,","Inglourious Basterds"
"99",883298,886301,"is I don't considerthe comparison an insult.","Inglourious Basterds"
"100",888804,892640,"Consider for a momentthe world a rat lives in.","Inglourious Basterds"
"101",893559,895769,"It's a hostile world,indeed.","Inglourious Basterds"
"102",896604,899981,"If a rat were to scamper throughyour front door, right now,","Inglourious Basterds"
"103",900066,902484,"would you greet itwith hostility?","Inglourious Basterds"
"104",903485,905320,"I suppose I would.","Inglourious Basterds"
"105",905404,906947,"Has a rat ever doneanything to you","Inglourious Basterds"
"106",907030,910325,"to create this animosityyou feel toward them?","Inglourious Basterds"
"107",911244,913870,"Rats spread disease.They bite people.","Inglourious Basterds"
"108",914413,918207,"Rats were the cause of the bubonicplague, but that's some time ago.","Inglourious Basterds"
"109",918293,920918,"I propose to you any diseasea rat could spread,","Inglourious Basterds"
"110",921004,923462,"a squirrel couldequally carry.","Inglourious Basterds"
"111",923548,925131,"Would you agree?","Inglourious Basterds"
"112",927009,929595,"Yet, I assume you don't sharethe same animosity with squirrels","Inglourious Basterds"
"113",929678,931679,"that you do with rats,do you?","Inglourious Basterds"
"114",931764,932764,"No.","Inglourious Basterds"
"115",932849,935350,"Yet, they're both rodents,are they not?","Inglourious Basterds"
"116",935434,939437,"And except for the tail, theyeven rather look alike, don't they?","Inglourious Basterds"
"117",939855,942691,"It's an interesting thought,Herr Colonel.","Inglourious Basterds"
"118",943400,945443,"However interestingas the thought may be,","Inglourious Basterds"
"119",945528,948779,"it makes not one bit ofdifference to how you feel.","Inglourious Basterds"
"120",951116,955202,"If a rat were to walk in here,right now, as I'm talking","Inglourious Basterds"
"121",956331,960167,"would you greet it with asaucer of your delicious milk?","Inglourious Basterds"
"122",960250,961710,"Probably not.","Inglourious Basterds"
"123",962419,964086,"I didn't think so.","Inglourious Basterds"
"124",964714,966255,"You don't like them.","Inglourious Basterds"
"125",966341,968216,"You don't really knowwhy you don't like them.","Inglourious Basterds"
"126",968301,971052,"All you know isyou find them repulsive.","Inglourious Basterds"
"127",973264,976307,"Consequently, a Germansoldier conducts a search","Inglourious Basterds"
"128",976392,978934,"of a house suspectedof hiding Jews.","Inglourious Basterds"
"129",979854,981437,"Where does the hawk look?","Inglourious Basterds"
"130",981522,984691,"He looks in the barn, he looks inthe attic, he looks in the cellar,","Inglourious Basterds"
"131",984775,987235,"he looks everywherehe would hide.","Inglourious Basterds"
"132",988196,992365,"But there are so many places itwould never occur to a hawk to hide.","Inglourious Basterds"
"133",994619,998288,"However, the reason the Führer hasbrought me off my Alps in Austria","Inglourious Basterds"
"134",998373,1002793,"and placed me in French cow countrytoday is because it does occur to me.","Inglourious Basterds"
"135",1004044,1007380,"Because I'm aware what tremendousfeats human beings are capable of","Inglourious Basterds"
"136",1007465,1009508,"once they abandon dignity.","Inglourious Basterds"
"137",1011259,1013427,"May I smoke my pipeas well?","Inglourious Basterds"
"138",1015764,1018642,"Please, Herr Colonel,make yourself at home.","Inglourious Basterds"
"139",1031405,1036451,"Now, my job dictates","Inglourious Basterds"
"140",1041790,1044459,"that I must have my menenter your home","Inglourious Basterds"
"141",1048381,1050257,"and conducta thorough search","Inglourious Basterds"
"142",1050340,1054135,"before I can officially crossyour family's name off my list.","Inglourious Basterds"
"143",1054886,1058765,"And if there are any irregularitiesto be found, rest assured they will be.","Inglourious Basterds"
"144",1058849,1061058,"That is unless you havesomething to tell me","Inglourious Basterds"
"145",1061144,1064186,"that makes the conductingof a search unnecessary.","Inglourious Basterds"
"146",1064271,1066522,"I might add, also,that any information","Inglourious Basterds"
"147",1066606,1071278,"that makes the performance of my dutyeasier will not be met with punishment.","Inglourious Basterds"
"148",1072113,1075656,"Actually, quite the contrary.It will be met with reward.","Inglourious Basterds"
"149",1076159,1077451,"And that reward will be,","Inglourious Basterds"
"150",1077535,1080327,"your family will ceaseto be harassed in any way","Inglourious Basterds"
"151",1080413,1084833,"by the German military during therest of our occupation of your country.","Inglourious Basterds"
"152",1095510,1098846,"You're sheltering enemiesof the state, are you not?","Inglourious Basterds"
"153",1104186,1105269,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"154",1108191,1112109,"You're sheltering them underneathyour floorboards, aren't you?","Inglourious Basterds"
"155",1114654,1115697,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"156",1118534,1121577,"Point out to me the areaswhere they're hiding.","Inglourious Basterds"
"157",1142599,1143974,"Since I haven't heardany disturbance,","Inglourious Basterds"
"158",1144059,1147770,"I assume, while they're listening,they don't speak English.","Inglourious Basterds"
"159",1149690,1150731,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"160",1152818,1155653,"I'm going to switch back to French now,and I want you to follow my masquerade.","Inglourious Basterds"
"161",1155738,1157196,"Is that clear?","Inglourious Basterds"
"162",1159157,1160241,"Yes.","Inglourious Basterds"
"163",1222179,1223305,"It's the girl.","Inglourious Basterds"
"164",1269559,1272103,"Au revoir, Shosanna!","Inglourious Basterds"
"165",1287536,1288912,"Ten-hut!","Inglourious Basterds"
"166",1295795,1297671,"My name isLieutenant Aldo Raine.","Inglourious Basterds"
"167",1297755,1301715,"And I'm putting together a specialteam, and I need me eight soldiers.","Inglourious Basterds"
"168",1301800,1304927,"Eight JewishAmerican soldiers.","Inglourious Basterds"
"169",1305680,1309473,"Now, you all might've heard rumorsabout the armada happening soon.","Inglourious Basterds"
"170",1309557,1312268,"Well, we'll be leavinga little earlier.","Inglourious Basterds"
"171",1313479,1316772,"We're going to be dropped intoFrance dressed as civilians.","Inglourious Basterds"
"172",1317400,1319692,"Once we'rein enemy territory,","Inglourious Basterds"
"173",1320318,1322278,"as a bushwhackingguerrilla army,","Inglourious Basterds"
"174",1322363,1325740,"we're going to be doing onething and one thing only.","Inglourious Basterds"
"175",1326282,1327741,"Killing Nazis.","Inglourious Basterds"
"176",1329744,1331328,"I don't knowabout you all,","Inglourious Basterds"
"177",1331413,1334332,"but I sure as hell didn't come downfrom the goddamn Smoky Mountains,","Inglourious Basterds"
"178",1334416,1338336,"cross 5, 000 miles of water,fight my way through half of Sicily","Inglourious Basterds"
"179",1338421,1342840,"and jump out of a fucking airplane toteach the Nazis lessons in humanity.","Inglourious Basterds"
"180",1342924,1345009,"Nazi ain't got no humanity.","Inglourious Basterds"
"181",1345760,1349263,"They're the foot soldiers of aJew-hating, mass-murdering maniac","Inglourious Basterds"
"182",1349347,1351598,"and they needto be destroyed.","Inglourious Basterds"
"183",1351976,1356311,"That's why any and every son of abitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,","Inglourious Basterds"
"184",1356771,1358605,"they're going to die.","Inglourious Basterds"
"185",1361568,1364988,"Now, I'm the direct descendentof the mountain man Jim Bridger.","Inglourious Basterds"
"186",1365072,1367198,"That means I gota little Indian in me.","Inglourious Basterds"
"187",1367282,1371536,"And our battle plan will bethat of an Apache resistance.","Inglourious Basterds"
"188",1372621,1374955,"We will be cruelto the Germans.","Inglourious Basterds"
"189",1375332,1378625,"And through our cruelty,they will know who we are.","Inglourious Basterds"
"190",1378794,1381046,"And they will findthe evidence of our cruelty","Inglourious Basterds"
"191",1381130,1383048,"in the disemboweled,dismembered","Inglourious Basterds"
"192",1383132,1386800,"and disfigured bodies of theirbrothers we leave behind us.","Inglourious Basterds"
"193",1386969,1389386,"And the German won't be ableto help themselves","Inglourious Basterds"
"194",1389471,1393223,"but imagine the cruelty theirbrothers endured at our hands,","Inglourious Basterds"
"195",1393893,1397311,"and our boot heelsand the edge of our knives.","Inglourious Basterds"
"196",1398689,1401066,"And the Germanwill be sickened by us.","Inglourious Basterds"
"197",1401150,1403358,"And the Germanwill talk about us.","Inglourious Basterds"
"198",1403443,1405653,"And the Germanwill fear us.","Inglourious Basterds"
"199",1406154,1408655,"And when the Germancloses their eyes at night","Inglourious Basterds"
"200",1408740,1412035,"and they're tortured by theirsubconscious for the evil they have done,","Inglourious Basterds"
"201",1412118,1415829,"it will be with thoughts of usthat they are tortured with.","Inglourious Basterds"
"202",1417374,1418540,"Sound good?","Inglourious Basterds"
"203",1418625,1420250,"Yes, sir!","Inglourious Basterds"
"204",1421586,1423378,"That's what I like to hear.","Inglourious Basterds"
"205",1423588,1427424,"But I got a word of warningfor all you would-be warriors.","Inglourious Basterds"
"206",1427509,1430385,"When you join my command,you take on debit.","Inglourious Basterds"
"207",1430805,1433388,"A debit you owe me,personally.","Inglourious Basterds"
"208",1435392,1439979,"Each and every man under mycommand owes me 100 Nazi scalps.","Inglourious Basterds"

"733",7665742,7667576,"So, the way I see it,","Inglourious Basterds"
"734",7667659,7671872,"since Hitler's death or possiblerescue rests solely on my reaction,","Inglourious Basterds"
"735",7672539,7674123,"if I do nothing,","Inglourious Basterds"
"736",7674542,7677252,"it's as if I'm causing hisdeath even more than yourselves.","Inglourious Basterds"

"745",7705614,7709158,"If you want to winthe war tonight,","Inglourious Basterds"
"746",7710787,7712953,"we have to make a deal.","Inglourious Basterds"

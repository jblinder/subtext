"442",2659000,2661206,"- How do you feel?- I...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"443",2661377,2664960,"I know you're not sleeping.We'll get to that.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"444",2665131,2667836,"Why don't you comeand have a sit this time.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"445",2668551,2672679,"- Maybe I'll stand.- Well, suit yourself.","The Matrix Reloaded"

"449",2694243,2695951,"You're not human, are you?","The Matrix Reloaded"
"450",2696120,2698693,"It's tough to get any more obviousthan that.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"451",2698873,2704708,"If I had to guess, I'd say you'rea program from the machine world.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"452",2705086,2709298,"- So is he.- So far, so good.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"453",2709466,2712633,"But if that's true, that could meanyou're part of this system...","The Matrix Reloaded"

"455",2715556,2717133,"Keep going.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"456",2717307,2720059,"I supposethe most obvious question is...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"457",2720226,2724141,"...how can I trust you?- Bingo.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"458",2725190,2728440,"It is a pickle, no doubt about it.Bad news is...","The Matrix Reloaded"

"460",2732447,2735982,"So it's really up to you. Just haveto make up your own damn mind...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"461",2736159,2740951,"...to either accept whatI'm going to tell you or reject it.","The Matrix Reloaded"

"475",2795301,2800212,"- Are there other programs like you?- Well, not like me, but...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"476",2800389,2803058,"Look. See those birds?","The Matrix Reloaded"
"477",2803308,2806677,"At some point, a program was writtento govern them.","The Matrix Reloaded"

"490",2852690,2855560,"- Why?- They have their reasons...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"491",2855735,2859685,"...but usually a program chooses exilewhen it faces deletion.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"492",2860114,2864029,"- And why would a program be deleted?- Maybe it breaks down.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"493",2864202,2868744,"Maybe a better program is createdto replace it. Happens all the time.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"494",2868914,2873872,"And when it does, a programcan either choose to hide here...","The Matrix Reloaded"

"513",2942236,2944775,"Now you have to understand it.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"514",2945406,2946782,"No.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"515",2946950,2950199,"I can't do that. I won't.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"516",2950911,2953283,"- Well, you have to.- Why?","The Matrix Reloaded"
"517",2953873,2956957,"Because you're the One.","The Matrix Reloaded"

"531",3011972,3014213,"We must go.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"532",3014390,3019764,"Seems like every time we meetI got nothing but bad news.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"533",3020355,3023225,"I'm sorry about that. I surely am.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"534",3023399,3026151,"But for what it's worth...","The Matrix Reloaded"

"543",3074617,3076609,"Our connection.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"544",3076785,3079454,"I don't fully understand how it happened.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"545",3079621,3082990,"Perhaps some part of youimprinted onto me...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"546",3083166,3085836,"...something overwritten or copied.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"547",3086002,3088707,"It is, at this point, irrelevant.What matters is...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"548",3088880,3091965,"...that whatever happened,happened for a reason.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"549",3092134,3093794,"And what reason is that?","The Matrix Reloaded"
"550",3094261,3098210,"I killed you, Mr. Anderson.I watched you die.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"551",3098389,3101640,"With a certain satisfaction,I might add.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"552",3101810,3105309,"And then something happened,something that I knew was impossible...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"553",3105480,3107307,"...but it happened anyway.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"554",3108024,3111191,"You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"555",3113195,3117774,"Afterward, I knew the rules, Iunderstood what I was supposed to do...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"556",3117950,3120951,"...but I didn't.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"557",3121371,3125285,"I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"558",3125750,3129284,"...compelled to disobey.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"559",3129879,3133627,"And now, here I standbecause of you, Mr. Anderson.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"560",3133799,3137749,"Because of you, I'm no longer an agentof this system.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"561",3137929,3141132,"Because of you, I've changed.I'm unplugged.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"562",3141307,3146134,"A new man, so to speak.Like you, apparently free.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"563",3146478,3147854,"Congratulations.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"564",3148605,3150931,"Thank you.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"565",3151525,3156152,"But as you well know,appearances can be deceiving...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"566",3156322,3161481,"...which brings me back to the reasonwhy we're here.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"567",3161660,3166536,"We're not here because we're free.We're here because we are not free.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"568",3166707,3170621,"There's no escaping reason,no denying purpose.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"569",3170794,3174163,"Because as we both know,without purpose...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"570",3174340,3179167,"...we would not exist.- It is purpose that created us.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"571",3179344,3182345,"- Purpose that connects us.- Purpose that pulls us.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"572",3182514,3184341,"- That guides us.- That drives us.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"573",3184516,3189225,"- It is purpose that defines.- Purpose that binds us.","The Matrix Reloaded"

"582",3462706,3463737,"More.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"583",3526018,3528853,"It is inevitable.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"584",3529271,3530682,"Come on, get out of there.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"585",3573898,3576223,"Are you all right?","The Matrix Reloaded"
"586",3577318,3579228,"- It was Smith.- Yes.","The Matrix Reloaded"

"588",3582907,3586691,"- How is that possible?- I don't know.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"589",3586869,3589325,"Somehow, he's found a wayto copy himself.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"590",3589497,3593708,"- Is that what he was doing to you?- I don't know what he was doing...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"591",3593876,3596628,"...but I know what it felt like.- What?","The Matrix Reloaded"
"592",3597547,3601246,"It felt like I was back in that hallway.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"593",3601425,3603010,"It felt like dying.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"594",3603343,3606214,"The machines are tunneling to avoidour defense system.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"595",3606388,3610220,"But I believe they will intersectcertain pipelines to control them.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"596",3610392,3612931,"These points of intersectionare crucial...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"597",3613104,3615891,"...because I believe they'revulnerable to counterattack.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"598",3616065,3620109,"Although it has been suggested thatthis is the same kind of attack...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"599",3620277,3623942,"...we've defended for years,I urge the Council to realize the truth.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"600",3624114,3627448,"This is the single greatest threatwe have ever faced...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"601",3627618,3631450,"...and if we do not act accordingly,we will not survive.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"602",3631622,3635619,"Commander Lock, the Council is wellaware of the seriousness of this attack.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"603",3635917,3640460,"You have our leave to prepare ourdefense by any and all means necessary.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"604",3640630,3643300,"- Thank you, Council.- However...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"605",3643550,3646884,"...we ask if there's been wordfrom the Nebuchadnezzar.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"606",3647137,3649627,"No, councilor. No word. Nothing.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"607",3651265,3655215,"Then we request a ship be dispatchedto ascertain the fate of the One.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"608",3655395,3659143,"I wish that were possible, councilor,but I do not believe our defense...","The Matrix Reloaded"
"609",3659316,3662850,"...can suffer the loss of another ship.- It will, commander, if it must.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"610",3663028,3665353,"It could take one ship daysto find the Nebuchadnezzar.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"611",3665529,3668566,"- Then send two.- This is insane.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"612",3668741,3671742,"Careful, commander.","The Matrix Reloaded"
"613",3671953,3675286,"Forgive my frustration, councilors.","The Matrix Reloaded"

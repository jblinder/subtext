"309",1073956,1077123,"- Why, maybe not.- Absolutely not, my boy.","Jezebel"
"310",1077293,1078621,"Woman, sir, is a chalice...","Jezebel"
"311",1078794,1082293,"...a frail, delicate chalice,to be cherished and protected.","Jezebel"

"314",1090139,1092131,"...to come surginginto his place of business?","Jezebel"
"315",1092308,1093850,"What would he have done, sir?","Jezebel"
"316",1094018,1096473,"He'd have cut him a hickory, sir.A hickory.","Jezebel"
"317",1096645,1098934,"He'd have flailedthe living daylights out of her...","Jezebel"
"318",1099106,1102605,"...and then helped put lard on her weltsand bought her a diamond brooch.","Jezebel"
"319",1102776,1106228,"That's what he'd have done, sir,and she'd have loved it.","Jezebel"

"337",1153369,1156038,"I appreciate your interest,but I believe I can handle this.","Jezebel"
"338",1156205,1161199,"Mr. Preston, Miss Julie say,will you most politely excuse her?","Jezebel"

"803",3322371,3324364,"Everything, I suppose.","Jezebel"
"804",3325541,3327368,"Are you very surprisedabout our getting...?","Jezebel"
"805",3327543,3329582,"We Louisianans are very impulsive.","Jezebel"

"812",3359491,3361899,"Do you think I wanna be wept over?","Jezebel"
"813",3362077,3364995,"I've gotta think, to plan, to fight.","Jezebel"
"814",3365164,3367737,"- But you can't fight marriage.- Marriage, is it?","Jezebel"
"815",3368500,3370992,"To that washed-out little Yankee?","Jezebel"
"816",3371170,3375002,"Pres is mine. He's always been mine.And if I can't have him...","Jezebel"
"817",3376175,3378666,"- Why, Buck.- Miss Julie.","Jezebel"

"820",3384391,3387179,"Most pointedly delighted.","Jezebel"
"821",3389730,3392897,"William Lloyd Garrison is a fanatic.Wendell Phillips is another.","Jezebel"
"822",3393067,3394775,"They've made a mightytouchy situation.","Jezebel"
"823",3394944,3397232,"But I can't believethe intelligent men up North...","Jezebel"
"824",3397404,3400156,"...plot to destroy our sovereign rights.- You sound calm now.","Jezebel"
"825",3400324,3403989,"You were raring to go when you joined upwith Andrew Jackson to fight the British.","Jezebel"
"826",3404161,3406368,"I was a lot younger then,and a lot foolisher.","Jezebel"
"827",3406539,3408946,"What Buck's been sayingdoesn't sound so foolish to me.","Jezebel"
"828",3409124,3412125,"Most of it makes sense.And I'll take the rest on faith.","Jezebel"
"829",3412294,3415129,"Why, that's the first timeyou ever said I talked sense.","Jezebel"
"830",3415548,3417090,"Well, you don't much.","Jezebel"
"831",3417258,3420009,"But it's refreshing to see a manwho knows his own mind.","Jezebel"
"832",3420177,3421422,"Don't you think so, Pres?","Jezebel"
"833",3421595,3423718,"It's hard to know your mind sometimes.","Jezebel"
"834",3423889,3426594,"If only we could put awaythis stale old quarrel.","Jezebel"
"835",3426767,3430468,"Exactly. I always say,""Let sleeping dogs lie.""","Jezebel"
"836",3430646,3433351,"Trouble is, those abolitionistsdon't act like sleeping dogs.","Jezebel"
"837",3433524,3435315,"They're scratching their fleas all over.","Jezebel"
"838",3435484,3438271,"Looks to me like we'll haveto hang a few to get us any peace.","Jezebel"
"839",3438445,3440901,"This William Lloyd Garrisonwould look elegant that way.","Jezebel"
"840",3441073,3444109,"I'm afraid your problems wouldn'tbe solved by hanging Mr. Garrison.","Jezebel"
"841",3444285,3445483,"Why, there's plenty more.","Jezebel"
"842",3445661,3448234,"I named Garrison becausehe's a traitor by his own say-so.","Jezebel"
"843",3448414,3451913,"And there's such meanness in a traitor.Don't you think so, Pres?","Jezebel"
"844",3453127,3455119,"Julie spoke to you, Pres.","Jezebel"
"845",3455296,3457703,"- Excuse me.- Oh, just small talk. Don't trouble.","Jezebel"
"846",3457882,3460337,"I'm sorry. It's... Tonight I'm haunted.","Jezebel"
"847",3460759,3464342,"- Haunted?- Only by memories, Uncle Cato.","Jezebel"
"848",3464597,3466969,"It's just coming back here.All my childhood summers.","Jezebel"
"849",3467141,3468421,"There's so much to remember.","Jezebel"
"850",3468601,3471388,"Remembering?A forward-looking young banker?","Jezebel"
"851",3471562,3473104,"Even a banker has memories.","Jezebel"
"852",3473272,3476024,"Well, he ought to kill them, then,or laugh at them.","Jezebel"
"853",3476192,3479109,"I interrupted you. You wereabout to hang somebody for a traitor.","Jezebel"
"854",3479278,3481021,"Why, for an abolitionist, Miss Julie.","Jezebel"
"855",3481363,3484567,"I think it was Voltaire who said,""I disagree with everything you say...","Jezebel"
"856",3484783,3487239,"...and I will defend to the deathyour right to say it.""","Jezebel"
"857",3489496,3490751,"Pres, that don't make sense.","Jezebel"
"858",3490856,3492948,"Maybe Pres got a little beyond us, Buck.","Jezebel"
"859",3493334,3496785,"We ignorant Southerners simply expecta gentleman to go by his raising.","Jezebel"
"860",3496962,3498540,"I think we're all agreed on that.","Jezebel"
"861",3498714,3500671,"Here's how I see it. Cotton is king.","Jezebel"
"862",3500841,3502715,"Folks are bound to ship cottondown river.","Jezebel"
"863",3502885,3505576,"So how can New Orleans keep frombeing the greatest city in America,...","Jezebel"
"864",3505786,3506752,"...fever or no fever?","Jezebel"
"865",3507014,3509256,"I'm afraid there's more thanfever the matter.","Jezebel"
"866",3509433,3511592,"Being up North changedyour point of view.","Jezebel"
"867",3511936,3515636,"I hate to say this, but in a warof commerce, the North must win.","Jezebel"
"868",3515814,3518056,"That's a curious thingfor a Southerner to say.","Jezebel"
"869",3518234,3519728,"It strikes me that way.","Jezebel"
"870",3519902,3522571,"But maybe Preshas learned why. Up North.","Jezebel"
"871",3522738,3527733,"If you must have it, it will be a victoryof machines over unskilled slave labor.","Jezebel"
"872",3527910,3531077,"- Preston!- I don't know that I like that, Dillard.","Jezebel"
"873",3531247,3533016,"You're not expected to like it.","Jezebel"
"874",3533017,3534995,"You'll like it a lot lesswhen it happens.","Jezebel"
"875",3535167,3537492,"And you talk mightylike a black abolitionist.","Jezebel"
"876",3537795,3541745,"I think you know I'm no abolitionist.I believe the tide has turned against us.","Jezebel"
"877",3541924,3545293,"But I'll swim against that tidejust as far as you will, Cantrell.","Jezebel"
"878",3545469,3547426,"Sure, we're all of one mind here.","Jezebel"
"879",3547596,3549755,"We hate an abolitionistas we hate the devil.","Jezebel"
"880",3549932,3552767,"Naturally, we claim the rightto the customs we were born to.","Jezebel"
"881",3552935,3555687,"Even some of us who questionthe value of those customs.","Jezebel"
"882",3555855,3559270,"I like my convictions undiluted,same as I do my bourbon.","Jezebel"
"883",3559441,3561481,"Frankly, I'm not impressedby Pres' nightmares.","Jezebel"
"884",3561652,3563941,"I've had dreams myself,but they never come to much.","Jezebel"
"885",3564113,3567446,"They slip away from you, and youwonder how you could've been so silly.","Jezebel"
"886",3567616,3568992,"Sure is a fact, Miss Julie.","Jezebel"
"887",3569451,3573745,"- There was one very curious one I had.- I'd certainly admire to hear it.","Jezebel"
"888",3573914,3576785,"Oh, heavens, I wouldn't thinkof boring our guests.","Jezebel"
"889",3576959,3578786,"Shall we go intothe drawing room, ladies?","Jezebel"
"890",3578961,3582045,"- It wouldn't bore me, Miss Julie.- Perhaps to you later.","Jezebel"
"891",3582214,3584041,"To you alone.","Jezebel"
"892",3584508,3586548,"We'll be in the drawing room.You can find us.","Jezebel"
"893",3586719,3588462,"You can lay 10-1 on me,Miss Julie.","Jezebel"
"894",3588637,3590215,"Gentlemen.","Jezebel"

"900",3609283,3611406,"Looks like it.If the Yankees don't let us be...","Jezebel"
"901",3611577,3613155,"...we'll have to teach them manners.","Jezebel"
"902",3613329,3615902,"I'm afraid facts are againstyou doing it as easy as that.","Jezebel"
"903",3616081,3618572,"Your facts are to scare womenand sell Northern bonds.","Jezebel"
"904",3618751,3620411,"- Cantrell.- I don't like to hear that.","Jezebel"
"905",3620586,3624085,"One fact you can't deny: That we'rethe guests of a charming hostess.","Jezebel"
"906",3624924,3627296,"Sorry, general.Most likely I misunderstood you, sir.","Jezebel"
"907",3627468,3630173,"I don't think you misunderstood, sir.I expressed an opinion.","Jezebel"
"908",3630346,3632837,"There was nothing personal about it.Take it as you like.","Jezebel"
"909",3633015,3634890,"Why, if it wasn't personal,I'm satisfied.","Jezebel"
"910",3634891,3636349,"Just understand, Cantrell...","Jezebel"
"911",3636519,3640053,"...the question of being satisfied aboutmy opinions is of no importance to me.","Jezebel"
"912",3640231,3641476,"Gentlemen. Gentlemen.","Jezebel"
"913",3641649,3644222,"Don't look like we're in the moodfor political discussion.","Jezebel"

"938",3821453,3823197,"Why, Pres?","Jezebel"
"939",3823747,3825705,"Because I love her.","Jezebel"
"940",3827334,3831118,"- But you had my love.- And lost it.","Jezebel"
"941",3831589,3835503,"Wasn't that memory more realthan anything she had to give to you?","Jezebel"

"951",3865873,3869705,"I ought to have come to you.I wanted to so terribly.","Jezebel"
"952",3869877,3872831,"It was because I wanted to so muchthat I couldn't.","Jezebel"

"954",3876592,3879462,"I didn't understand.I just knew what you did.","Jezebel"
"955",3879637,3881713,"But you had to come home,didn't you?","Jezebel"

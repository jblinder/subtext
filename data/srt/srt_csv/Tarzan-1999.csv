"495",2871410,2872994,"This is capital!","Tarzan"
"496",2873078,2875162,"Janey-Jane, what a discovery!","Tarzan"
"497",2875247,2877790,"A man with no language,no human behaviour...","Tarzan"
"498",2877875,2880251,"And no respectfor personal boundaries.","Tarzan"

"500",2882754,2884005,"Staring at me.","Tarzan"
"501",2884089,2887341,"He seemed confused at first,","Tarzan"
"502",2887426,2890011,"as if he's never seenanother human before.","Tarzan"
"503",2890095,2895266,"And his eyes were intenseand focused, and...","Tarzan"
"504",2896143,2899520,"I've never seen such eyes.","Tarzan"
"505",2901690,2906027,"Shall I leave you and the blackboardalone for a moment?","Tarzan"

"524",2961333,2963376,"Moves like an ape,looks like a man.","Tarzan"
"525",2963460,2966462,"He could be the missing link.","Tarzan"
"526",2966546,2970216,"Or our link to the gorillas.","Tarzan"
"527",2970300,2972760,"Yes, yes.","Tarzan"

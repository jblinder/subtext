"800",4160197,4164634,"...might not slacken the tensedmuscles of paralyzed patients.","Mr. Sardonicus"
"801",4164835,4167770,"It was only a theory.A flimsy one at that.","Mr. Sardonicus"
"802",4167971,4171634,"- Too dangerous to be used on humans.- I see.","Mr. Sardonicus"
"803",4171842,4175608,"I'm afraid a long period of researchlies ahead of me.","Mr. Sardonicus"
"804",4176480,4180211,"- I wouldn't want to fail.- That is correct.","Mr. Sardonicus"

"824",4272810,4275472,"...and threatened to expose himas an embezzler.","Mr. Sardonicus"
"825",4275679,4279274,"So your father forced you into thisunsavory alliance?","Mr. Sardonicus"
"826",4279483,4281917,"No. The choice was mine.","Mr. Sardonicus"
"827",4282119,4283848,"I did it to save him.","Mr. Sardonicus"

"1096",5150938,5152063,"Here.","Deep Impact"
"1097",5155609,5156734,"Look.","Deep Impact"
"1098",5166370,5167745,"Where's Mom?","Deep Impact"
"1099",5168872,5170540,"Behind the camera.","Deep Impact"
"1100",5171917,5173417,"She took this?","Deep Impact"
"1101",5174044,5175711,"And this one, too.","Deep Impact"
"1102",5177256,5180091,"She was such an artist,don't you think so?","Deep Impact"
"1103",5181927,5183886,"You don't rememberwhen you take them?","Deep Impact"
"1104",5183971,5186973,"I'm five years old. Howwould I remember that?","Deep Impact"
"1105",5187432,5191394,"Well, some people do rememberwhen they were five years old.","Deep Impact"
"1106",5194273,5196399,"It was such a beautiful day.","Deep Impact"
"1107",5196567,5198442,"All alone on the beach.","Deep Impact"
"1108",5200737,5203614,"And of course she wouldhave been in the picture,","Deep Impact"
"1109",5203699,5207118,"but there was no oneelse to hold the camera,","Deep Impact"
"1110",5208036,5210705,"and she insisted.","Deep Impact"
"1111",5211665,5213457,"You know how she is.","Deep Impact"
"1112",5214543,5215960,"How she was.","Deep Impact"
"1113",5217838,5219005,"Jenny.","Deep Impact"
"1114",5224386,5227680,"It was such a good day for all of us.","Deep Impact"
"1115",5228932,5230641,"Don't you remember?","Deep Impact"
"1116",5237608,5238941,"Keep them.","Deep Impact"
"1117",5242321,5243529,"Goodbye.","Deep Impact"
"1118",5277189,5280191,"We have now confirmed the launchof all the Titan missiles","Deep Impact"
"1119",5280275,5283444,"from their positions inNorth Dakota and Wyoming.","Deep Impact"
"1120",5283528,5286238,"The comets are nowapproximately 14 hours","Deep Impact"
"1121",5286323,5288532,"outside of Earth's atmosphere,","Deep Impact"
"1122",5288825,5290952,"and we are told it shouldtake these missiles","Deep Impact"
"1123",5291036,5293871,"less than 20 minutesto reach their target.","Deep Impact"
"1124",5294581,5296707,"Okay, here's what we're looking at.","Deep Impact"
"1125",5296792,5299168,"All of the Titans have been launched.","Deep Impact"
"1126",5299252,5302463,"We still won't know ifthey've made a difference.","Deep Impact"
"1127",5302547,5304799,"The comets have to travel for a while","Deep Impact"
"1128",5304883,5308094,"before the radar tracking stationscan see if they've been pushed","Deep Impact"
"1129",5308178,5310972,"to a safe course that'llbypass the Earth.","Deep Impact"
"1130",5311348,5314392,"So one more time, we have to wait.","Deep Impact"
"1131",5334746,5337248,"Are we on?- We're on, Mr. President.","Deep Impact"
"1132",5347759,5349760,"Our missiles have failed.","Deep Impact"
"1133",5351388,5354015,"The comets are still headed for Earth,","Deep Impact"
"1134",5356893,5359729,"and there's nothing wecan do to stop them.","Deep Impact"
"1135",5362607,5364108,"So this is it.","Deep Impact"
"1136",5365444,5367445,"If the world does go on,","Deep Impact"
"1137",5368238,5370531,"it will not go on for everyone.","Deep Impact"
"1138",5372200,5375953,"We have now been able to calculatethe comets' final trajectories,","Deep Impact"
"1139",5376038,5379331,"and we have determined wherethey're going to strike.","Deep Impact"
"1140",5379708,5383169,"The smaller of the two comets,Biederman, will hit first","Deep Impact"
"1141",5383253,5384879,"somewhere along the Atlantic seaboard,","Deep Impact"
"1142",5384963,5388049,"probably in the waters offthe coast of Cape Hatteras,","Deep Impact"
"1143",5388133,5391802,"in just under 12 hours, at 4:35 p.m.Eastern Daylight Time.","Deep Impact"
"1144",5392846,5395556,"The impact of the comet is going to be,","Deep Impact"
"1145",5396641,5398267,"well, disastrous.","Deep Impact"
"1146",5399394,5401395,"There will be a very large tidal wave","Deep Impact"
"1147",5401480,5403564,"moving quickly throughthe Atlantic Ocean.","Deep Impact"
"1148",5403648,5407735,"It'll be 100 feet high, travelingat 1,100 miles an hour.","Deep Impact"
"1149",5407819,5410488,"That's faster than the speed of sound.","Deep Impact"
"1150",5410822,5413324,"As the wave reaches shallowwater it's going to slow down,","Deep Impact"
"1151",5413408,5417745,"but the wave height, depending on thedepth of the shelf off the coast,","Deep Impact"
"1152",5417829,5421749,"will be anywhere from1,000 to 3,500 feet high.","Deep Impact"
"1153",5423877,5426462,"Where the land is flat,the wave will wash inland","Deep Impact"
"1154",5426546,5428839,"600 to 700 miles.","Deep Impact"
"1155",5430258,5434178,"The wave will hit our nation'scapital 40 minutes after impact.","Deep Impact"
"1156",5435847,5440559,"New York City, Boston,Atlanta, Philadelphia,","Deep Impact"
"1157",5442354,5444188,"all will be destroyed.","Deep Impact"
"1158",5444397,5448234,"If you have any means of gettingaway from the path of this wave,","Deep Impact"
"1159",5448318,5449652,"leave now.","Deep Impact"
"1160",5450278,5452530,"The impact of the larger comet","Deep Impact"
"1161",5452864,5456158,"will be nothing less thanan extinction-level event.","Deep Impact"
"1162",5456701,5460746,"It will strike land in westernCanada three hours after Biederman.","Deep Impact"
"1163",5462249,5465084,"Within a week, the skies will bedark with dust from the impact,","Deep Impact"
"1164",5465168,5467795,"and they will stay dark for two years.","Deep Impact"
"1165",5468672,5471257,"All plant life will be dead within","Deep Impact"
"1166",5472884,5474218,"four weeks.","Deep Impact"
"1167",5475512,5477304,"Animal life within","Deep Impact"
"1168",5479057,5480516,"a few months.","Deep Impact"
"1169",5484020,5485479,"So that's it.","Deep Impact"
"1170",5486940,5488732,"Good luck to us all.","Deep Impact"
"1171",5515177,5519597,"Could I bother everyone for a minute?Now, let's take a look at the big one.","Deep Impact"
"1172",5519681,5523142,"Now, the out-gassing has createda vent a half a mile wide","Deep Impact"
"1173",5523226,5526187,"and at least 2 miles deep.Comet gets closer to the sun,","Deep Impact"
"1174",5526271,5530065,"sun melts ice, ice turns tosteam, we get a big hole. Okay?","Deep Impact"
"1175",5531026,5534987,"So, how many nukes wehave left in the back?","Deep Impact"
"1176",5535155,5536280,"Four.","Deep Impact"
"1177",5537407,5541827,"Okay. if we can get theremaining bombs in that vent,","Deep Impact"
"1178",5542996,5546207,"there shouldn't be anything left ofthat comet bigger than a suitcase.","Deep Impact"
"1179",5546291,5549335,"Now, we can't do anythingabout the little one,","Deep Impact"
"1180",5549669,5552796,"but, you know, it justmight give them a chance.","Deep Impact"
"1181",5553506,5555174,"Now, without the arming codes,we're gonna have to wait","Deep Impact"
"1182",5555258,5559136,"to set the bomb timers until we getcloser to Earth to raise Houston.","Deep Impact"
"1183",5559221,5561180,"We may not have enoughlife support left","Deep Impact"
"1184",5561264,5564183,"to get back into thecargo bay for the nukes,","Deep Impact"
"1185",5564392,5566310,"much less to work down on the comet.","Deep Impact"
"1186",5566394,5568646,"And we sure as hell don't have enoughpropellant left in the Messiah","Deep Impact"
"1187",5568730,5570356,"to maneuver with.","Deep Impact"
"1188",5571900,5574944,"How are we supposed to get backoff the surface once we've...","Deep Impact"
"1189",5575028,5577154,"Once we've gone down there?","Deep Impact"
"1190",5582035,5583327,"We don't.","Deep Impact"
"1191",5592170,5594630,"Well, you look at the bright side.","Deep Impact"
"1192",5595382,5598217,"We'll all have highschools named after us.","Deep Impact"
"1193",5619698,5625160,"Houston, this is Messiah.","Deep Impact"
"1194",5638133,5640259,"Nice of you to call, Messiah.","Deep Impact"
"1195",5640343,5642386,"We were beginning to wonder whatthe hell you were doing up there.","Deep Impact"
"1196",5642470,5645556,"- Admiring the view, Houston.- Fish, is that you?","Deep Impact"
"1197",5645640,5648309,"Yep. We don't havetime to talk, Houston.","Deep Impact"
"1198",5648393,5651312,"There's nothing we can do about thesmaller one, but we do have a plan.","Deep Impact"
"1199",5651396,5653897,"We need the arming codesfor the last four nukes.","Deep Impact"
"1200",5653982,5655607,"Arming codes? What the hell for?","Deep Impact"
"1201",5655692,5658694,"Mitch, we can do or we can teach.What's your pleasure?","Deep Impact"
"1202",5660280,5662823,"Get the arming codes.Get the goddamn codes!","Deep Impact"
"1203",5663158,5665492,"We have one helicopter.It holds seven people.","Deep Impact"
"1204",5665577,5667745,"We can ferry six people tohigh ground in West Virginia","Deep Impact"
"1205",5667829,5670748,"and take Jenny to the Ark.Short stick goes.","Deep Impact"
"1206",5671750,5673751,"I always thought it waswomen and children first.","Deep Impact"
"1207",5673835,5677129,"If you get the short one,you can give up your seat.","Deep Impact"
"1208",5678631,5679965,"Thank God.","Deep Impact"
"1209",5688016,5689933,"Well, that makes sense.","Deep Impact"
"1210",5692062,5694605,"I got a stick. I got a stick.","Deep Impact"
"1211",5703406,5706325,"- I'm sorry, Beth.- Okay, honey, here we go.","Deep Impact"

"1225",5836331,5839333,"so I thought, well, if the wavedoes come, that we should be here","Deep Impact"
"1226",5839417,5843378,"because she likes it here and...l mean, we're on the 15th floor,","Deep Impact"
"1227",5843463,5845506,"- so maybe we'll be okay.- Come on, honey.","Deep Impact"

"475",2702998,2705876,"If he was conflicted,if he ever had doubts.","Iron Man"
"476",2706793,2711088,"Or maybe he was every inch the manwe all remember from the newsreels.","Iron Man"
"477",2715425,2717552,"I saw young Americans killed","Iron Man"
"478",2718429,2722474,"by the very weapons I createdto defend them and protect them.","Iron Man"
"479",2723891,2725268,"And I saw","Iron Man"
"480",2726478,2731273,"that I had become part of a system thatis comfortable with zero accountability.","Iron Man"
"481",2731356,2733358,"- Mr. Stark!- Hey, Ben.","Iron Man"
"482",2734068,2736070,"What happened over there?","Iron Man"

"484",2740699,2745077,"to offer this worldthan just making things that blow up.","Iron Man"
"485",2745161,2748664,"And that is why, effective immediately,I am shutting down","Iron Man"

"504",2816226,2818853,"That's what we do. We're iron mongers.We make weapons.","Iron Man"
"505",2818938,2820063,"It's my name on the side of the building.","Iron Man"
"506",2820146,2822773,"And what we dokeeps the world from falling into chaos.","Iron Man"
"507",2822858,2824818,"Not based on what I saw.","Iron Man"
"508",2826068,2827070,"We're not doing a good enough job.","Iron Man"
"509",2827152,2828405,"We can do better.We're gonna do something else.","Iron Man"
"510",2828487,2831365,"Like what?You want us to make baby bottles?","Iron Man"
"511",2832367,2835619,"I think we should take another lookinto arc reactor technology.","Iron Man"
"512",2835702,2840039,"Come on.The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!","Iron Man"
"513",2840373,2843501,"Tony, come on. We built that thingto shut the hippies up!","Iron Man"
"514",2843585,2846713,"- It works.- Yeah, as a science project.","Iron Man"
"515",2847172,2850465,"The arc was never cost effective.We knew that before we built it.","Iron Man"
"516",2850550,2853719,"Arc reactor technology,that's a dead end, right?","Iron Man"
"517",2853802,2854971,"Maybe.","Iron Man"
"518",2855387,2857972,"Am I right? We haven't hada breakthrough in that in what?","Iron Man"
"519",2858056,2860601,"- Thirty years.- That's what they say.","Iron Man"

"1179",6122672,6124091,"It's, like, a thing that's goingto pick the lock?","Iron Man"
"1180",6124175,6126926,"You might want to takea few steps back.","Iron Man"
"1181",6145485,6148029,"That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.","Iron Man"
"1182",6148113,6150907,"Not bad, huh? Let's do it.","Iron Man"

"1187",6208585,6211962,"Looks like you were right.He was building a suit.","Iron Man"
"1188",6212546,6214548,"I thought it'd be bigger.","Iron Man"
"1189",6259423,6260591,"Take him out!","Iron Man"
"1190",6271309,6273310,"How do you think the Mark Ichest piece is going to hold up?","Iron Man"

"1215",6445219,6446845,"Duly noted.Take me to maximum altitude.","Iron Man"
"1216",6446929,6449222,"With only 15% power,the odds of reaching that...","Iron Man"
"1217",6449305,6451475,"I know the math! Do it!","Iron Man"
"1218",6459774,6462068,"Sir, you're not going to believe this.That thing is back.","Iron Man"

"1228",6515283,6516784,"Icing problem?","Iron Man"
"1229",6518994,6521329,"Might want to look into it.","Iron Man"
"1230",6533007,6534341,"Two percent.","Iron Man"
"1231",6536469,6539346,"We are now runningon emergency backup power.","Iron Man"

"1238",6598609,6601028,"- Potts?- Tony!","Iron Man"
"1239",6601112,6602113,"This isn't working.","Iron Man"

"1241",6604573,6607451,"- Well, how are you going to do that?- You're going to do it.","Iron Man"
"1242",6607533,6609994,"Go to the central console,open up all the circuits.","Iron Man"
"1243",6610078,6611496,"When I get clear of the roof,I'll let you know.","Iron Man"
"1244",6611579,6614207,"You're going to hitthe master bypass button.","Iron Man"
"1245",6614248,6615625,"It's going to fry everything up here.","Iron Man"
"1246",6617793,6620087,"Okay. I'm going in now.","Iron Man"
"1247",6620171,6623423,"Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.I'll buy you some time.","Iron Man"
"1248",6632932,6634768,"This looks important!","Iron Man"
"1249",6655619,6658413,"I never had a taste for this sort of thing,","Iron Man"
"1250",6658497,6662627,"but I must admit,I'm deeply enjoying the suit!","Iron Man"
"1251",6670884,6673386,"You finally outdid yourself, Tony!","Iron Man"
"1252",6675764,6677890,"You'd have made your father proud!","Iron Man"
"1253",6682853,6685355,"It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!","Iron Man"
"1254",6704873,6706207,"Tony!","Iron Man"
"1255",6707417,6709043,"How ironic, Tony!","Iron Man"

"1265",6814724,6819311,"There have been unconfirmed reportsthat a robotic prototype malfunctioned","Iron Man"
"1266",6819354,6821980,"and caused damage to the arc reactor.","Iron Man"
"1267",6822689,6824942,"Fortunately, a memberof Tony Stark's personal security staff...","Iron Man"
"1268",6825024,6826944,"""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy.It's got a nice ring to it.","Iron Man"
"1269",6827069,6830697,"I mean, it's not technically accurate.The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,","Iron Man"
"1270",6830780,6833408,"but it's kind of evocative,the imagery, anyway.","Iron Man"
"1271",6833490,6835159,"Here's your alibi.","Iron Man"
"1272",6835993,6837078,"Okay.","Iron Man"

"1276",6843417,6846545,"See, I was thinking maybe we shouldsay it was just Pepper and me","Iron Man"
"1277",6846670,6848421,"alone on the island.","Iron Man"
"1278",6849715,6851007,"- That's what happened.- All right.","Iron Man"
"1279",6851091,6853217,"Just read it, word for word.","Iron Man"
"1280",6855136,6857137,"There's nothing about Stane here.","Iron Man"
"1281",6857221,6860015,"That's being handled. He's on vacation.","Iron Man"
"1282",6860891,6863351,"Small aircraft havesuch a poor safety record.","Iron Man"
"1283",6863435,6865938,"But what about the whole cover storythat it's a bodyguard?","Iron Man"
"1284",6866020,6868940,"He's my... I mean, is that...That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?","Iron Man"
"1285",6869065,6871318,"This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.","Iron Man"
"1286",6871400,6875404,"Just stick to the official statement,and soon, this will all be behind you.","Iron Man"

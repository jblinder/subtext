"1359",5742055,5744297,"Why? For believing?","The Avengers"
"1360",5744434,5745975,"For taking on Loki alone.","The Avengers"
"1361",5745976,5747811,"He was doing his job.","The Avengers"
"1362",5747813,5750350,"He was out of his league.He should have waited.","The Avengers"

"1380",5783097,5785097,"Yeah, divide and conquer is great","The Avengers"
"1381",5785100,5787555,"but he knows he has totake us out to win, right?","The Avengers"
"1382",5787685,5789354,"That's what he wants.","The Avengers"
"1383",5789354,5791845,"He wants to beat us,he wants to be seen doing it.","The Avengers"

"109",623799,626893,"they were all knownas lawgivers.","Compulsion"
"110",627003,630200,"Actually, my question waswhether Moses and the others...","Compulsion"

"112",634410,638141,"All men are boundby law, Mr. Steiner.","Compulsion"

"125",677853,680448,"as anger, and greed, andlust and the will to power.","Compulsion"

"128",686797,689391,"Perhaps my thinkingis outmoded.","Compulsion"
"129",689499,692127,"But I stillcling to the theory...","Compulsion"

"137",713390,718453,"Oh, very good, Mr. Brooks.You surprise me.","Compulsion"
"138",718562,721555,"But just for once, I shall take a leaffrom Nietzsche's book...","Compulsion"
"139",721666,724499,"place myself above the law,and grade you accordingly.","Compulsion"

"619",2487992,2489960,"What's the matter?","Compulsion"
"620",2506310,2510474,"You... want me to...order you to, Judd?","Compulsion"
"621",2517755,2518703,"Right up in the top branch.","Compulsion"
"622",2518738,2519652,"Right up in the top branch.","Compulsion"
"623",2519758,2524491,"I can't- Oh! Wait.I saw something move.","Compulsion"
"624",2524596,2526564,"That's it. Here.","Compulsion"

"629",2549387,2551912,"You seem so sad.","Compulsion"
"630",2554492,2556460,"That's a sentimental term.","Compulsion"
"631",2558630,2560996,"There's no such thingas sadness.","Compulsion"
"632",2562400,2564368,"Only the realityof things happening.","Compulsion"
"633",2565604,2567538,"You don't reallybelieve that, Judd.","Compulsion"
"634",2567639,2572201,"Over there, for instance. That's wherethey found the body of the Kessler boy.","Compulsion"
"635",2572310,2574870,"Is that sad?","Compulsion"
"636",2576147,2578115,"Yes, it is.","Compulsion"
"637",2579952,2581852,"Terribly sad.","Compulsion"
"638",2585958,2589826,"Is it sad that you're here?All alone, with me?","Compulsion"
"639",2589929,2593056,"Just you and I, and littlePaulie Kessler's ghost.","Compulsion"
"640",2593164,2595155,"- You shouldn't joke about that.- Why not?","Compulsion"
"641",2600005,2601974,"What's one life,more or less?","Compulsion"
"642",2603709,2606940,"There were nine millionpeople killed in the war.","Compulsion"

"644",2611884,2614409,"You're not that cruel.","Compulsion"
"645",2621694,2624788,"- No?- No.","Compulsion"
"646",2627033,2630230,"Murder's nothing.","Compulsion"
"647",2633172,2636573,"It's just a simple experience.","Compulsion"
"648",2636676,2639076,"Murder and rape?","Compulsion"
"649",2639178,2642842,"Do you know what beauty there is in evil?","Compulsion"
"650",2642949,2645110,"Is there?","Compulsion"
"651",2645218,2648312,"Yes.","Compulsion"
"652",2648422,2652187,"- You're trying to frighten me, Judd.- If you were to move now-","Compulsion"
"653",2654894,2659092,"- Why don't you run?- Is that what you want me to do?","Compulsion"
"654",2659198,2661599,"Yes!","Compulsion"
"655",2661702,2666105,"- Do you have to attack me, Judd?- I don't have to do anything!","Compulsion"

"666",2713887,2716788,"- Didn't you ever see one?- No. What does it do?","Compulsion"
"667",2716890,2719825,"Watch, and you'll find out.","Compulsion"
"668",2727602,2730969,"See, when they get to the slaughterhouse, heducks to one side, and the silly sheep...","Compulsion"
"669",2731072,2734838,"go in to get their throats cut-that black devil knows it.","Compulsion"
"670",2736878,2739608,"- Did you get rid of the typewriter?- Uh-huh.","Compulsion"
"671",2739714,2742808,"There's a pit out back,where they bury all the entrails.","Compulsion"
"672",2742917,2745784,"Nobody'll go near that.","Compulsion"
"673",2745887,2748549,"So, uh, how did youmake out?","Compulsion"
"674",2750391,2752518,"Oh, fine.","Compulsion"
"675",2752627,2755790,"You're pretty smug about it.","Compulsion"
"676",2755897,2757922,"But if you did,how come you're not sweaty?","Compulsion"
"677",2758032,2761024,"Like after Paulie. And after youfound out about those stinkin' glasses.","Compulsion"
"678",2761135,2763866,"I just wasn't rationalat the time.","Compulsion"
"679",2763972,2768341,"After thinking about it, I realize there wasnothing really distinctive about them.","Compulsion"
"680",2768443,2772572,"- There must be hundreds exactly like them-- 4,200, to be exact.","Compulsion"
"681",2772680,2774443,"- I asked Lieutenant Johnson.- You asked the police?","Compulsion"
"682",2774478,2776207,"- I asked Lieutenant Johnson.- You asked the police?","Compulsion"
"683",2776317,2779047,"Sure! Why not?I figured we might as well know.","Compulsion"
"684",2779153,2781678,"So, I asked Johnson why they weren'tfollowing that lead.","Compulsion"
"685",2781789,2783758,"You fool!","Compulsion"
"686",2785661,2787788,"You'resweating again, Juddsie.","Compulsion"
"687",2787896,2791127,"Why? Now we know!They can't trace 4,200 pair.","Compulsion"
"688",2791233,2795033,"They can't trace anything. The whole case'llblow over in a couple of weeks.","Compulsion"
"689",2795137,2797605,"Hey, come on. Let's go watch themslaughter the sheep.","Compulsion"
"690",2802945,2804913,"I looked all throughmy bedroom, gentlemen.","Compulsion"
"691",2805013,2808813,"I just don't understand it.I'm positive I had them last night.","Compulsion"
"692",2808917,2810851,"Have you seen thoseglasses of mine, Emma?","Compulsion"
"693",2810953,2812978,"The ones with the black rims?On my desk, perhaps?","Compulsion"
"694",2813088,2815386,"I just cleaned your room this morning,Mr. Judd. They weren't there then.","Compulsion"
"695",2815490,2817424,"- I don't think I could have lost them.- They wouldn't be...","Compulsion"
"696",2817526,2821053,"- someplace else around the house?- Well, I only use them for study.","Compulsion"
"697",2821163,2823564,"- What do you think?- The boss is pretty definite about it.","Compulsion"
"698",2823666,2826032,"- It's the State's Attorney. He gave us orders-- Mr. Horn.","Compulsion"
"699",2826135,2828865,"I'm a great admirer of his.I'm a law student, you know.","Compulsion"
"700",2828972,2832134,"He wanted to talk personally to anybodyon the list who didn't have their glasses.","Compulsion"
"701",2832241,2836405,"I see. Then I expect you want to take medown to the Hall of Justice with you, now.","Compulsion"
"702",2836511,2839810,"Not exactly. The Pennington Hotel.Mr. Horn's taken a suite there.","Compulsion"
"703",2839915,2841815,"Just to protectanyone he talks to.","Compulsion"
"704",2841917,2845251,"You know what the reporterswill do with something like this.","Compulsion"
"705",2845355,2848688,"Of course.Very considerate.","Compulsion"
"706",2848791,2850759,"Shall we?","Compulsion"
"707",2854998,2858195,"I certainly wouldn't want you to admitsomething you're not sure of, Judd.","Compulsion"
"708",2858301,2860326,"But it is possible you couldhave dropped these out there.","Compulsion"
"709",2860436,2862494,"Yes. It is possible.","Compulsion"
"710",2862604,2865506,"If they actuallywere mine, sir.","Compulsion"
"711",2865608,2868577,"As I say, I very often carry themin the breast pocket of my jacket.","Compulsion"
"712",2868678,2870646,"This jacket,as a matter of fact.","Compulsion"
"713",2870747,2873307,"When I take my classesto Hegewisch.","Compulsion"
"714",2873416,2875748,"And you were out there Tuesday,the day before the crime.","Compulsion"
"715",2875852,2880346,"Yes, sir. I should think you wouldhave checked that first.","Compulsion"
"716",2880456,2884120,"There are ten members in my class,all very reputable people, I assure you.","Compulsion"
"717",2884228,2887322,"Oh, come on, Judd.You're taking this all much too seriously.","Compulsion"
"718",2887431,2889956,"We all know you'rea prominent ornithologist.","Compulsion"
"719",2890067,2892296,"It's entirely logicalthat your glasses could have dr-","Compulsion"
"720",2894604,2896902,"Oh, I'm all right.","Compulsion"
"721",2897006,2898940,"It's funny. They didn'tdrop out of my pocket.","Compulsion"
"722",2903747,2908684,"Oh, I'm sorry, sir. But it looked likeyou were acting that out for a jury.","Compulsion"
"723",2908786,2910879,"Forgot you were a law student, Judd.","Compulsion"
"724",2910988,2912888,"Yes, it wasrather far-fetched.","Compulsion"
"725",2912990,2918656,"Uh, do you suppose you couldshow us how these glasses might
have fallen out of your pocket?","Compulsion"
"726",2921664,2923632,"Go right ahead.","Compulsion"
"727",2934411,2936971,"Of course, the terrainis considerably different out there.","Compulsion"
"728",2937081,2939049,"Mm, of course.","Compulsion"
"729",2941585,2945249,"I suppose I could have tripped overa root or something.","Compulsion"
"730",2947726,2950320,"Like this.","Compulsion"
"731",2961638,2963606,"They didn't fall outof my pocket, either.","Compulsion"
"732",2965143,2967509,"No.","Compulsion"
"733",2969481,2972109,"May I seeyour coat a moment?","Compulsion"
"734",2973952,2975920,"Yes, sir.","Compulsion"
"735",2979958,2983188,"Could you have taken itoff because of the heat...","Compulsion"
"736",2983293,2987594,"or something you wanted to do,and then, uh- picked it up later?","Compulsion"
"737",2996408,2999536,"Yes, but I wouldn'tpick my coat up that way.","Compulsion"
"738",2999644,3004776,"- Why not?- I'm very careful about my clothes.","Compulsion"
"739",3004884,3006852,"Unless you werein a hurry.","Compulsion"
"740",3008187,3010155,"Unless it was dark.","Compulsion"
"741",3014192,3017992,"Well, this is all purely academic,if they're not really my glasses, isn't it, sir?","Compulsion"
"742",3018096,3020087,"I don't know, of course,but I would imagine there must be...","Compulsion"
"743",3020198,3022496,"a thousand pair of glasses likethose right here in Chicago.","Compulsion"
"744",3024335,3027533,"The figure isabout 4,000,Judd.","Compulsion"
"745",3027640,3030507,"But these happento be your glasses.","Compulsion"
"746",3030609,3033407,"In spite of the fact they look likethousands of others, they aren't.","Compulsion"
"747",3033512,3037778,"You see, a firm in Rochesterdeveloped this new hinge.","Compulsion"
"748",3039418,3042818,"Almer Coe is their only outlet here.They sold three pairs.","Compulsion"
"749",3042921,3045186,"One to an executive who's beenin Europe for a month...","Compulsion"
"750",3045291,3048920,"one to a woman in River Forest,and the third to you.","Compulsion"
"751",3054133,3056624,"Interesting?","Compulsion"
"752",3056735,3059670,"Now, how would you like to tell usabout Wednesday afternoon?","Compulsion"
"753",3072861,3076661,"I must say, you've given us a very detailedaccount of your activities, Judd.","Compulsion"
"754",3076765,3079233,"- Ten times.- Oh, we're very thorough.","Compulsion"
"755",3079334,3082030,"We'll have to find some wayto corroborate this, you see.","Compulsion"
"756",3082137,3085699,"None of it, uh- driving aroundin your Stutz Bearcat-","Compulsion"
"757",3085808,3088333,"Lake Shore Drive, Jackson Park,hot dog stand, Mae and Edna-","Compulsion"
"758",3088444,3091777,"None of it is particularlyeasy to check.","Compulsion"
"759",3091881,3094509,"Well, it would beif you found Mae and Edna.","Compulsion"
"760",3094617,3096744,"Yes, but Mae and Edna who?","Compulsion"
"761",3096853,3099413,"You didn't tell them your right names,and they didn't tell you anything.","Compulsion"
"762",3099522,3101717,"See how it is?","Compulsion"
"763",3101824,3104314,"Look, Judd. I know how you feelabout involving a friend...","Compulsion"
"764",3104426,3107123,"and I appreciate your family's feelingsabout picking up stray girls...","Compulsion"
"765",3107230,3109562,"but you might considermy position too.","Compulsion"
"766",3109666,3111759,"I simply have tocheck this story.","Compulsion"
"767",3115605,3119837,"Look, Judd.","Compulsion"
"768",3119943,3123037,"I give you my word, I'll never say anythingto either of your families...","Compulsion"
"769",3123146,3125114,"if you tell meyour friend's name.","Compulsion"
"770",3126617,3129848,"Then we can wash this all up,and have you home for dinner.","Compulsion"
"771",3134991,3137118,"All right.","Compulsion"
"772",3137227,3139422,"I doubt that he'llever speak to me again...","Compulsion"
"773",3141331,3143697,"- but his name is Artie Strauss.- Artie Strauss?","Compulsion"
"774",3143800,3146770,"- Attends the university also.- You know him?","Compulsion"
"775",3146870,3150203,"He's the kid that'sbeen helping me all along.","Compulsion"
"776",3150307,3153299,"Very interesting. If you pick him upand bring him in...","Compulsion"
"777",3153410,3155844,"he may be ableto help us some more.","Compulsion"
"778",3157414,3159814,"Yes, sir.","Compulsion"
"779",3163453,3165921,"Right through there.Straight ahead, Artie. Come on.","Compulsion"
"780",3166022,3167923,"- Open up!- There he is! Get him!","Compulsion"
"781",3176500,3178832,"- What's going on?- We've been waiting
downstairs for two hours.","Compulsion"
"782",3178936,3181427,"- Don't you think it's abouttime you gave us a statement?
- I'll give you a statement...","Compulsion"
"783",3181538,3184564,"when I'm good and ready to-in the meantime, there'll be
no reporters in this suite!","Compulsion"
"784",3196453,3198353,"That's better.","Compulsion"
"785",3198455,3200650,"Is there anythingI can get you, Strauss?","Compulsion"
"786",3200758,3202885,"Artie. Just makeit Artie, sir.","Compulsion"
"787",3202993,3206087,"I could, uh, use a cigarette,if you have one.","Compulsion"
"788",3206196,3208791,"- Came away so quickly that I didn't-- Sir, have one of mine.","Compulsion"
"789",3208900,3211425,"Thank you.","Compulsion"
"790",3211536,3213902,"Oh, this is Mr. Horn,Artie, the State's Attorney.","Compulsion"

"795",3224315,3227945,"- Oh, I think we can do that, Mr. Strauss.- Artie. Please, sir.","Compulsion"
"796",3228053,3230385,"You see, I uh, answered the doorwhen your men arrived...","Compulsion"
"797",3230488,3233082,"and, uh, since I didn'twant to worry Mumsy-","Compulsion"
"798",3233191,3236217,"My mother, that is- I just came along.","Compulsion"
"799",3236328,3239024,"Oh, all right. Well, this won'ttake but a few minutes.","Compulsion"
"800",3239130,3243999,"Oh, fine. You see, uh, dinner's at 8:30,and Dad likes me to be on time.","Compulsion"

"817",3289014,3290914,"It's pretty hard toremember that far back.","Compulsion"
"818",3291016,3293314,"- That's what your friend Judd said.- He did?","Compulsion"
"819",3293419,3295717,"But he managedto recall a few things.","Compulsion"
"820",3295821,3298517,"Oh? Well, uh, didhe say I was with him?","Compulsion"
"821",3298624,3301320,"That's hardlythe point, is it, Artie?","Compulsion"

"1358",5271417,5273851,"A few nights ago, as you all know,","Manhattan Melodrama"
"1359",5274754,5279657,"Edward J. Gallagher was put to deathin the electric chair at Sing Sing","Manhattan Melodrama"
"1360",5280326,5282226,"for the crime of murder.","Manhattan Melodrama"
"1361",5284730,5286664,"What you do not know is","Manhattan Melodrama"

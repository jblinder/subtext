"235",1196760,1199194,"I think you're old enoughto be told why.","Cape Fear"
"236",1202720,1207191,"Eight years ago I was a witness againsta man, and he was sent to prison.","Cape Fear"
"237",1207280,1209510,"The thing is, he's out now...","Cape Fear"
"238",1209600,1212239,"and blames me for his conviction.","Cape Fear"
"239",1212320,1214470,"He's the onethat poisoned Marilyn.","Cape Fear"
"240",1214560,1217677,"Maybe,but there's no proof of that.","Cape Fear"
"241",1217760,1219990,"But you know he did.","Cape Fear"
"242",1220080,1222196,"Thinking isn't knowing.","Cape Fear"

"246",1229880,1232678,"I'll get youa police photograph of him.","Cape Fear"
"247",1234480,1236550,"Until we have this thingunder control...","Cape Fear"
"248",1236640,1239950,"I want you never to leave this houseor the school grounds...","Cape Fear"
"249",1240040,1242110,"except in your mother's car.","Cape Fear"
"250",1252440,1255477,"There's nothing to worry aboutas long as you're careful.","Cape Fear"
"251",1255560,1258028,"The police are going to keepa very close watch on the house.","Cape Fear"
"252",1258120,1260953,"The chances arehe's just trying to scare us anyway.","Cape Fear"
"253",1264200,1267078,"A man like thatdoesn't deserve civil rights.","Cape Fear"
"254",1267160,1270755,"Darling, you can't put a man in jailfor what he might do...","Cape Fear"
"255",1270840,1273195,"and thank heaven for that.","Cape Fear"
"256",1277920,1281390,"You think we could go away for a while,take Nancy out of school?","Cape Fear"
"257",1281480,1284119,"Well, I did think of that.","Cape Fear"
"258",1284200,1286998,"But Cady can afford to goanyplace we can go.","Cape Fear"
"259",1291200,1293998,"What are we going to doabout that man?","Cape Fear"
"260",1296840,1298671,"I don't know yet.","Cape Fear"
"261",1298760,1301035,"I know one thing.","Cape Fear"
"262",1301120,1304874,"Mustn't let him frighten us.That'd bejust playing his game.","Cape Fear"
"263",1319120,1320519,"Sam?","Cape Fear"
"264",1401040,1402871,"What are you doing down here?","Cape Fear"
"265",1402960,1406032,"- I was hungry, and I heard Dad.- Where is he?","Cape Fear"
"266",1406120,1407951,"He's talking to a policeman.","Cape Fear"
"267",1410560,1413552,"Probably just drove along the alleyand tossed the meat out.","Cape Fear"
"268",1414600,1416750,"Well, thanks for coming by.","Cape Fear"
"269",1416840,1418398,"Good night.","Cape Fear"

"271",1435760,1438558,"What were your physical findings,Dr Pearsall?","Cape Fear"
"272",1438640,1441200,"Physical findings were a one-inchshortening of the left leg.","Cape Fear"
"273",1441280,1442872,"And the X ray?","Cape Fear"
"274",1442960,1445394,"The X ray revealed that thoughthe fracture had healed...","Cape Fear"
"275",1445480,1448278,"there was marked indicationof degenerative joint disease.","Cape Fear"
"276",1448360,1450351,"By degenerative joint disease,you mean arthritis?","Cape Fear"
"277",1450440,1452510,"- Yes.- And what was your diagnosis?","Cape Fear"
"278",1452600,1455876,"Diagnosis was hip fracture withdestruction of the joint surfaces...","Cape Fear"
"279",1455960,1458872,"which caused the painand restriction of motion.","Cape Fear"
"280",1458960,1460791,"You then performed surgeryupon the plaintiff?","Cape Fear"
"281",1460880,1462518,"Yes.","Cape Fear"
"282",1462600,1467515,"This model should make the operationeasy for the jury to understand.","Cape Fear"
"283",1467720,1470917,"- What is it?- Chief Dutton wants to see you.","Cape Fear"
"284",1472000,1474275,"- Right now?- Right now.","Cape Fear"

"289",1487720,1491235,"Oh, yes.Yes, it is clear to me.","Cape Fear"
"290",1491320,1494118,"That's fine, if you wantto handle it that way.","Cape Fear"
"291",1494200,1497158,"Then you tell the countyit's their case, that's all.","Cape Fear"
"292",1497240,1499231,"I'm sorry to pull you out like this...","Cape Fear"
"293",1499320,1501276,"but this could be seriousfor both of us.","Cape Fear"
"294",1501360,1504557,"Your friend Cadyturned up with Dave Grafton.","Cape Fear"
"295",1504640,1506278,"Oh, that's it.","Cape Fear"
"296",1506360,1509636,"Well, he got himself the right man.","Cape Fear"
"297",1509720,1513076,"Not for us. You know what he's like.He's one of these ardent types.","Cape Fear"
"298",1513160,1514991,"You slap a cigaretteout of some hoodlum's mouth...","Cape Fear"
"299",1515080,1518072,"five minutes later he's in the mayor'soffice yelling ""police brutality""...","Cape Fear"
"300",1518160,1520071,"rallying the bleeding heart squad.","Cape Fear"
"301",1526320,1528754,"- Hello, Dave.- Good morning, Sam.","Cape Fear"
"302",1528840,1531638,"I hope you haven't cometo dispute me on any technicalities.","Cape Fear"
"303",1531720,1534518,"No, I'm here as a citizen,not as a lawyer.","Cape Fear"
"304",1534600,1537990,"- Don't worry about technicalities.- Thank you very kindly.","Cape Fear"
"305",1539200,1543159,"First, let me say that my clientdoes not want to make any trouble.","Cape Fear"
"306",1543240,1546596,"He merely wants to put an endto this persecution.","Cape Fear"
"307",1546680,1548796,"What persecution is this?","Cape Fear"
"308",1548880,1552873,"Well, I believe your recordswill show the following:","Cape Fear"
"309",1552960,1555190,"Detention in jaillast Friday night...","Cape Fear"
"310",1555280,1558272,"I agree that you are,technically, within your rights.","Cape Fear"
"311",1558360,1561557,"I merely mention thisas the beginning of a pattern.","Cape Fear"
"312",1561640,1562868,"What pattern?","Cape Fear"
"313",1562960,1566032,"I intend to establishthis pattern.","Cape Fear"
"314",1566120,1570033,"On Saturday, Mr Cady's roomwas searched, his car was searched.","Cape Fear"
"315",1570120,1572076,"Did he protest the search?","Cape Fear"
"316",1572160,1576119,"During this time he was made to feelhe was suspected of poisoning a dog...","Cape Fear"
"317",1576200,1578998,"a truly despicable act, causingserious damage to his reputation.","Cape Fear"
"318",1579080,1580718,"Hold on right there.","Cape Fear"
"319",1580800,1583951,"I can guarantee you none of my officersmentioned this to anyone but Cady.","Cape Fear"
"320",1584040,1585075,"Perhaps.","Cape Fear"
"321",1585160,1587196,"But people become curious...","Cape Fear"
"322",1587280,1589555,"when a citizen's roomis searched by police.","Cape Fear"
"323",1589640,1591198,"On Monday...","Cape Fear"
"324",1591280,1593874,"my client was picked upand interrogated by police...","Cape Fear"
"325",1593960,1595791,"on suspicion of armed robbery.","Cape Fear"
"326",1595880,1599873,"Tuesday, he was forced to stand in aline-up on suspicion of purse snatching.","Cape Fear"
"327",1600560,1602391,"This constant attentionby the police...","Cape Fear"
"328",1602480,1605278,"caused his landlady to ask himto vacate the premises.","Cape Fear"
"329",1605360,1608591,"He was forced to find other,more expensive lodgings.","Cape Fear"
"330",1608680,1610955,"All right, what's the point?","Cape Fear"
"331",1611040,1613952,"Don't the police have a rightto interrogate a suspect any more?","Cape Fear"
"332",1617040,1619838,"You know, if anybodyhad told me a week ago...","Cape Fear"
"333",1619920,1622753,"that you were capableof a remark like that...","Cape Fear"
"334",1624160,1626754,"Let me continue with the pattern.","Cape Fear"
"335",1626840,1628751,"On Wednesday,he was picked up twice...","Cape Fear"
"336",1628840,1632116,"first on suspicion of burglary,second on suspicion of grand theft auto.","Cape Fear"
"337",1632200,1635636,"His new landlord became aware of thisin some manner...","Cape Fear"
"338",1635720,1637756,"and again Mr Cadywas forced to move.","Cape Fear"
"339",1637840,1640070,"His present lodgingsare squalid and uncomfortable.","Cape Fear"
"340",1640160,1643038,"Today is Thursday.You must be about finished.","Cape Fear"
"341",1643120,1644917,"For the moment, yes.","Cape Fear"
"342",1645000,1647958,"Then what is this patternyou're talking about?","Cape Fear"
"343",1648040,1651749,"I'm sure Mr Bowden hereis still enough of a lawyer to see it.","Cape Fear"
"344",1652960,1654791,"My client is an ex-convict.","Cape Fear"
"345",1654880,1657155,"He's been constantly harassedby the police...","Cape Fear"
"346",1657240,1659708,"subjected to extreme mental crueltyand public degradation.","Cape Fear"
"347",1659800,1662360,"He's even been deniedan adequate place to live!","Cape Fear"
"348",1662440,1665477,"To be very blunt, gentlemen,my client has been thoroughly rousted.","Cape Fear"
"349",1666880,1668871,"And isn't it also a fact...","Cape Fear"
"350",1668960,1671599,"that with manpoweras short as you say it is...","Cape Fear"
"351",1671680,1674319,"that officersare assigned day and night...","Cape Fear"
"352",1674400,1678359,"to guarding the premises of one privateindividual, your personal friend...","Cape Fear"
"353",1678440,1680431,"this without any evidenceof danger?","Cape Fear"
"354",1680520,1682033,"You're referring to my house?","Cape Fear"
"355",1682120,1683633,"Yes, I am.","Cape Fear"
"356",1683720,1685597,"Then I ask...","Cape Fear"
"357",1686560,1688710,"who furnished youwith that information?","Cape Fear"
"358",1698760,1702435,"Well, I think you will findthat this is a matter of...","Cape Fear"
"359",1702520,1704511,"common knowledgein the department.","Cape Fear"
"360",1704600,1706750,"Grafton,I want you to listen to this.","Cape Fear"
"361",1706840,1710753,"I don't owe Sam Bowdenany special favours, nor do I give any.","Cape Fear"
"362",1710840,1714469,"In each 24 hours, there's been less thantwo hours devoted to guarding his house.","Cape Fear"
"363",1714560,1716596,"I'm prepared to substantiate that.","Cape Fear"
"364",1716680,1718398,"Now, are you finished?","Cape Fear"
"365",1720480,1722948,"That depends, gentlemen.","Cape Fear"
"366",1723040,1725429,"It depends whollyon the treatment...","Cape Fear"
"367",1725520,1728318,"that my client receivesfrom now on.","Cape Fear"
"368",1730200,1732236,"Come, Mr Cady.","Cape Fear"
"369",1732320,1733673,"Gentlemen.","Cape Fear"
"370",1737640,1739995,"I'll see you around, Counsellor.","Cape Fear"
"371",1747840,1750638,"Now you can see why I wanted youto hear this, Sam.","Cape Fear"
"372",1750720,1753518,"I can't do anything morewithout an overt act.","Cape Fear"
"373",1753600,1755431,"Like a neat little murder?","Cape Fear"
"374",1755520,1758353,"Well, you show me a lawthat prevents crime.","Cape Fear"
"375",1758440,1760590,"All we can dois act after the fact.","Cape Fear"
"376",1760680,1762557,"You remember the Hoffman murder?","Cape Fear"
"377",1762640,1765438,"Before she was killed, Mrs Hoffmancame up here week after week...","Cape Fear"
"378",1765520,1768159,"telling us that her husband wasgoing to do it, and I believed it.","Cape Fear"
"379",1768240,1771471,"But I couldn't arrest the manfor something that might be in his mind.","Cape Fear"
"380",1771560,1772879,"That's dictatorship.","Cape Fear"
"381",1772960,1776032,"Sam, you're a citizen.Would you want it any other way?","Cape Fear"
"382",1780240,1783277,"Then what am I supposed to do?","Cape Fear"
"383",1783360,1785715,"Pull up the drawbridge?","Cape Fear"
"384",1785800,1788598,"Sit home with a loaded gun? Havethe groceries dropped in by airlift?","Cape Fear"
"385",1788680,1791956,"That's kind of an artificial wayto live, wouldn't you say?","Cape Fear"
"386",1792040,1794679,"Sam, I'm going to makea humiliating suggestion...","Cape Fear"
"387",1794760,1796591,"and it's humiliating for me.","Cape Fear"
"388",1798000,1800150,"You hire yourselfa private detective.","Cape Fear"
"389",1800240,1803550,"That's all you can do.Get Charlie Sievers.","Cape Fear"
"390",1803640,1806916,"If anyone can dig upsomething we can act on, he can.","Cape Fear"
"391",1808040,1810031,"- Private detective.- That's right.","Cape Fear"
"392",1812080,1815152,"I'm not going to go intothe ""I am a taxpayer"" routine...","Cape Fear"
"393",1815240,1817071,"but is that the bestyou can do?","Cape Fear"
"394",1817160,1818991,"You're telling meto hire protection?","Cape Fear"
"395",1819080,1821196,"It's a hell of a note, isn't it?","Cape Fear"
"396",1821280,1823748,"Either we have too many lawsor not enough.","Cape Fear"
"397",1840680,1842636,"Why are we going this way?","Cape Fear"
"398",1842720,1844756,"Better scenery.","Cape Fear"
"399",1844840,1847957,"What would you knowabout scenery?","Cape Fear"
"400",1848040,1849439,"Or beauty?","Cape Fear"
"401",1849520,1853308,"Or any of the thingsthat really make life worth living?","Cape Fear"
"402",1854560,1856596,"You're just an animal.","Cape Fear"
"403",1857680,1860399,"Coarse, lustful...","Cape Fear"
"404",1860480,1861754,"barbaric.","Cape Fear"
"405",1861840,1865230,"Keep right on talkin', honey.I like it when you run me down.","Cape Fear"
"406",1867280,1869271,"Max Cady.","Cape Fear"

"409",1874600,1877512,"I wouldn't expect youto understand this...","Cape Fear"

"640",3358400,3360152,"Good.","Cape Fear"

"776",3918920,3921957,"There's a houseboat.It's up on the Cape Fear River.","Cape Fear"

"792",3962000,3965515,"The next step is to lure him up therewhen we're ready for him.","Cape Fear"
"793",3965600,3967477,"That's your department too.","Cape Fear"
"794",3967560,3969630,"He knows you're tied inwith the case.","Cape Fear"

"797",3975680,3978831,"You can't shoot a man forsimple trespass. Not any more.","Cape Fear"
"798",3978920,3982310,"- Cady's built a good case against you.- It'll be more than simple trespass.","Cape Fear"
"799",3982400,3985198,"But I won't wait until he wipesthe blood off his hands either.","Cape Fear"
"800",3985280,3987475,"Now hold on.Just hold on.","Cape Fear"
"801",3987560,3990028,"I've listened.Now you listen.","Cape Fear"

"806",4001600,4003636,"All you have to dois pick up the telephone!","Cape Fear"
"807",4003720,4007030,"And do what? Ask for half a dozendeputies to help a man I should arrest?","Cape Fear"
"808",4007120,4008951,"I don't wanthalf a dozen deputies.","Cape Fear"
"809",4009040,4011793,"That would be a sure wayof tipping off Cady and Grafton.","Cape Fear"
"810",4011880,4014633,"It'd be all over townin no time.","Cape Fear"
"811",4014720,4018633,"One is all I can risk.One is all I'm asking for.","Cape Fear"
"812",4018720,4020551,"Do I get him?","Cape Fear"

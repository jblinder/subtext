"291",1068080,1069520,"Twenty percent. Why?","Double Indemnity"

"293",1072160,1074640,"I can always use it. I wasthinking about my husband.","Double Indemnity"
"294",1074720,1077040,"I worry a lot about himdown in those oil fields.","Double Indemnity"

"305",1099400,1101000,"It could.Well...","Double Indemnity"
"306",1102320,1105480,"don't you think he ought tohave accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.","Double Indemnity"
"307",1106480,1108720,"What kind of insurancecould he have?","Double Indemnity"
"308",1108800,1110920,"Enough to cover doctorsand hospital bills.","Double Indemnity"
"309",1111000,1113000,"Say $125 a week cash benefit.","Double Indemnity"
"310",1113040,1115360,"And he'd rate around$50,000 capital sum.","Double Indemnity"
"311",1115440,1118560,"Capital sum? What's that?In case he gets killed.","Double Indemnity"
"312",1119320,1121640,"Maybe I shouldn'thave said that.","Double Indemnity"

"314",1124040,1125360,"Well, your husbandwould understand.","Double Indemnity"
"315",1125440,1128120,"I'm sure I could sell him on theidea of some accident protection.","Double Indemnity"
"316",1128200,1129680,"Why don't I talkto him about it?","Double Indemnity"
"317",1129760,1131840,"You could try,but he's pretty tough-going.","Double Indemnity"
"318",1131920,1133920,"They're all tough at first.","Double Indemnity"
"319",1134680,1135880,"He has a lot on his mind.","Double Indemnity"
"320",1135920,1137600,"He doesn't seem to wantto listen to anything...","Double Indemnity"
"321",1137680,1140400,"except maybea baseball game on the radio.","Double Indemnity"
"322",1140720,1144480,"Sometimes we sit here all eveningand never say a word to each other.","Double Indemnity"
"323",1144560,1148040,"(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.So, I just sit and knit.","Double Indemnity"
"324",1149360,1150640,"Is that what youmarried him for?","Double Indemnity"
"325",1150720,1153760,"Maybe I like the wayhis thumbs hold up the wool.","Double Indemnity"
"326",1154200,1156360,"Anytime his thumbsget tired...","Double Indemnity"
"327",1156440,1158720,"Only, with me around,you wouldn't have to knit.","Double Indemnity"
"328",1158800,1160800,"Wouldn't I? You betyour life, you wouldn't.","Double Indemnity"
"329",1163760,1167040,"Wonder if a little rumwould get this up on its feet.","Double Indemnity"
"330",1169040,1171440,"I want to ask yousomething, Walter.","Double Indemnity"
"331",1173600,1177040,"Could I get an accident policy forhim without bothering him at all?","Double Indemnity"
"332",1177120,1178120,"How's that, again?","Double Indemnity"
"333",1178160,1181040,"It would make it easier for you, too.You wouldn't even have to talk to him.","Double Indemnity"
"334",1181080,1182560,"I have a littleallowance of my own.","Double Indemnity"
"335",1182640,1185680,"I could pay for it and heneedn't know anything about it.","Double Indemnity"
"336",1188040,1189160,"Why shouldn't he know?","Double Indemnity"
"337",1189240,1191560,"Because he doesn't wantaccident insurance.","Double Indemnity"
"338",1191600,1195400,"He's superstitious about it. A lotof people are. That's funny, isn't it?","Double Indemnity"
"339",1195440,1199440,"If there was a way to get it likethat, all the worry would be over.","Double Indemnity"
"340",1200360,1203320,"See what I mean, Walter?Sure. I got good eyesight.","Double Indemnity"
"341",1203400,1206000,"You mean you want him to havethe policy without him knowing it.","Double Indemnity"
"342",1206080,1209000,"And that means without the insurancecompany knowing that he doesn't know it.","Double Indemnity"
"343",1209040,1211720,"That's the setup, isn't it? Isthere anything wrong with it?","Double Indemnity"
"344",1211800,1213080,"No, I think it's lovely.","Double Indemnity"
"345",1213160,1215480,"Then, if some dark, wet night,that crown block did fall on him...","Double Indemnity"
"346",1215560,1216560,"What crown block?","Double Indemnity"
"347",1216640,1219600,"Only sometimes it can't quite make iton its own, it has to have a little help.","Double Indemnity"
"348",1219680,1220960,"I don't know whatyou're talking about.","Double Indemnity"
"349",1221040,1222400,"Of course, it doesn't haveto be a crown block.","Double Indemnity"
"350",1222480,1225440,"It can be a car backing over him, or hecould fall out of the upstairs window.","Double Indemnity"
"351",1225520,1227520,"Any little thing like that,just so it's a morgue job.","Double Indemnity"
"352",1227600,1229720,"Are you crazy?Not that crazy.","Double Indemnity"

"356",1241520,1242960,"That's a horriblething to say.","Double Indemnity"
"357",1243000,1244240,"What'd you thinkI was, anyway?","Double Indemnity"
"358",1244320,1246600,"A guy that walks into a goodlooking dame's front parlor and says:","Double Indemnity"

"369",1278800,1280240,"I knew I had holdof a red-hot poker...","Double Indemnity"
"370",1280280,1282920,"and the time to drop it wasbefore it burned my hand off.","Double Indemnity"
"371",1283600,1287360,"I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle ofbeer, the one I had wanted all along...","Double Indemnity"
"372",1287440,1291120,"only I wanted it worse now, to get ridof the sour taste of her iced tea...","Double Indemnity"
"373",1291200,1293040,"and everythingthat went with it.","Double Indemnity"
"374",1293120,1296160,"I didn't want to go back to the officeso I dropped by a bowling alley...","Double Indemnity"

"451",1550640,1552000,"I suppose because it'dcost him too much money.","Double Indemnity"
"452",1552080,1554520,"He hasn't got any money. Not sincehe went into the oil business.","Double Indemnity"
"453",1554600,1556280,"But he hadwhen you married him?","Double Indemnity"

"467",1598360,1600840,"Not even when he gets drunkand slaps my face.","Double Indemnity"
"468",1603600,1606520,"Only sometimes you wishhe was dead. Perhaps I do.","Double Indemnity"
"469",1606600,1610160,"Then you wish it was an accident,and you had that policy for $50,000.","Double Indemnity"
"470",1610640,1612680,"Is that it?Perhaps that, too.","Double Indemnity"
"471",1614760,1617720,"The other night we drove homefrom a party. He was drunk again.","Double Indemnity"

"473",1621520,1623200,"and the motor still running.","Double Indemnity"
"474",1623680,1627080,"And I thought what it would belike if I didn't switch it off...","Double Indemnity"

"476",1630480,1631560,"I'll tell you whatit'd be like.","Double Indemnity"
"477",1631640,1634120,"If you had that accident policyand tried to pull a monoxide job...","Double Indemnity"

"481",1641040,1643080,"In 10 minutes you'd be sittingunder the hot lights.","Double Indemnity"
"482",1643120,1645200,"In a half-hour you'd be signingyour name to a confession.","Double Indemnity"
"483",1645280,1647040,"But, Walter, I didn't do itand I'm not going to do it.","Double Indemnity"
"484",1647120,1649280,"Not if there's an insurancecompany in the picture, baby.","Double Indemnity"
"485",1649360,1651360,"They know more tricksthan a carload of monkeys.","Double Indemnity"
"486",1651440,1653800,"And if there's a death mixed upin it, you haven't got a prayer.","Double Indemnity"
"487",1653880,1656840,"They'll hang you just as sureas ten dimes will buy a dollar.","Double Indemnity"

"490",1667280,1668880,"(Walter)So we just sat there.","Double Indemnity"
"491",1669240,1673160,"She started crying softly, like the rainon the window, and we didn't say anything.","Double Indemnity"
"492",1673400,1676080,"Maybe she had stopped thinkingabout it, but I hadn't.","Double Indemnity"
"493",1676360,1677320,"I couldn't.","Double Indemnity"
"494",1677400,1680720,"Because it all tied up with somethingI'd been thinking about for years.","Double Indemnity"
"495",1680760,1683400,"Since long before I everran into Phyllis Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"496",1684320,1686200,"Because you knowhow it is, Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"497",1686720,1687840,"In this businessyou can't sleep...","Double Indemnity"
"498",1687920,1690640,"for trying to figure out all thetricks they could pull on you.","Double Indemnity"

"500",1692160,1695320,"watching the customers to makesure they don't crook the house.","Double Indemnity"
"501",1695800,1698920,"And then one night, you get to thinkinghow you could crook the house yourself.","Double Indemnity"
"502",1698960,1700440,"And do it smart.","Double Indemnity"
"503",1700520,1702520,"Because you've got that wheelright under your hands.","Double Indemnity"
"504",1702600,1704640,"You know every notch in itby heart.","Double Indemnity"
"505",1704880,1707280,"And you figure all you needis a plant out front.","Double Indemnity"
"506",1707600,1709320,"A shill to put down the bet.","Double Indemnity"
"507",1710320,1711400,"And suddenlythe doorbell rings...","Double Indemnity"
"508",1711480,1713840,"and the whole setup is rightthere in the room with you.","Double Indemnity"
"509",1717520,1720480,"Look, Keyes, I'm not tryingto whitewash myself.","Double Indemnity"
"510",1721400,1724720,"I fought it, only I guessI didn't fight it hard enough.","Double Indemnity"

"517",1759000,1761760,"You believe me, don't you,Walter? Sure I believe you.","Double Indemnity"
"518",1764480,1767480,"I can't stand it anymore.What if they did hang me?","Double Indemnity"
"519",1767560,1769800,"They're not goingto hang you, baby.","Double Indemnity"
"520",1769840,1771360,"It's better thangoing on this way.","Double Indemnity"
"521",1771440,1772520,"They're not gonnahang you because...","Double Indemnity"

"541",1871200,1872840,"I was trying to thinkwith your brains, Keyes...","Double Indemnity"
"542",1872920,1874960,"because I wantedall the answers ready...","Double Indemnity"

"1055",3629720,3633280,"I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I'veformed a very definite opinion.","Double Indemnity"
"1056",3633360,3636840,"I think I know. In fact, I know Iknow what happened to Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1057",3636920,3640160,"You know you know what?I know it was not an accident.","Double Indemnity"
"1058",3643400,3645840,"What do you say to that?Me?","Double Indemnity"
"1059",3647160,3649480,"Well, you've got the ball.Let's see you run with it.","Double Indemnity"
"1060",3649520,3652960,"There's a widespread feeling that justbecause a man has a large office...","Double Indemnity"
"1061",3653040,3654120,"[intercom buzzing]","Double Indemnity"
"1062",3655920,3658480,"Yes? Have her come in, please.","Double Indemnity"
"1063",3659000,3660480,"There's a widespreadfeeling that...","Double Indemnity"
"1064",3660560,3663720,"just because a man has a largeoffice, he must be an idiot.","Double Indemnity"
"1065",3663800,3665680,"I'm having a visitor,if you don't mind.","Double Indemnity"
"1066",3665720,3668560,"No, no. I want you to stayand watch me handle this.","Double Indemnity"
"1067",3668640,3670200,"Mrs. Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1068",3674200,3676520,"Thank you very muchfor coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1069",3676600,3679240,"I assure you I appreciateit. This is Mr. Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1070",3679320,3680720,"How do you do?How do you do?","Double Indemnity"
"1071",3680800,3682720,"And Mr. Neff. I've metMr. Neff. How do you do?","Double Indemnity"
"1072",3682800,3685280,"Mrs. Dietrichson.Won't you sit down?","Double Indemnity"
"1073",3687800,3689560,"(Norton) May I extend oursympathy in your bereavement?","Double Indemnity"
"1074",3689640,3692000,"I hesitated before asking you tocome here so soon after your loss.","Double Indemnity"
"1075",3692080,3695600,"But now that you're here I hope you won'tmind if I plunge straight into business?","Double Indemnity"
"1076",3695680,3697160,"You know why we askedyou to come, don't you?","Double Indemnity"
"1077",3697240,3699720,"No. All I know is that yoursecretary made it sound very urgent.","Double Indemnity"
"1078",3699800,3701840,"Your husband had an accidentpolicy with this company.","Double Indemnity"
"1079",3701920,3703560,"Evidently you don't know that,Mrs. Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1080",3703600,3706240,"No. I remember some talk at thehouse, but he didn't seem to want it.","Double Indemnity"
"1081",3706320,3709480,"Your husband took the policy outa few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1082",3709520,3711920,"You'll probably find the policyamong his personal effects.","Double Indemnity"
"1083",3712000,3713680,"His safe-deposit boxhasn't been opened yet.","Double Indemnity"
"1084",3713760,3715680,"It seems a tax examinerhas to be present.","Double Indemnity"
"1085",3715760,3717360,"Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,I don't want you to think...","Double Indemnity"
"1086",3717440,3718800,"you're being subjected toany questioning...","Double Indemnity"
"1087",3718880,3720440,"but there are a few thingswe should like to know.","Double Indemnity"
"1088",3720520,3721480,"What sort of things?","Double Indemnity"
"1089",3721880,3723960,"We have the report ofthe coroner's inquest.","Double Indemnity"
"1090",3724040,3726960,"Accidental death.We are not entirely satisfied.","Double Indemnity"
"1091",3727040,3729520,"In fact,we are not satisfied at all.","Double Indemnity"
"1092",3731400,3733920,"Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,we suspect...","Double Indemnity"
"1093",3735120,3736360,"a suicide.","Double Indemnity"
"1094",3739640,3742880,"I'm sorry. Would you likea glass of water? Please.","Double Indemnity"
"1095",3747440,3748720,"Thank you.","Double Indemnity"
"1096",3754480,3757880,"Had your husband been depressedor moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?","Double Indemnity"
"1097",3757960,3760600,"Did he have financial worries,for instance?","Double Indemnity"
"1098",3760680,3763880,"He was perfectly all right and Idon't know of any financial worries.","Double Indemnity"
"1099",3763920,3765960,"Let us examine thisso-called accident.","Double Indemnity"
"1100",3766040,3770000,"First, your husband takes out thispolicy in absolute secrecy. Why?","Double Indemnity"
"1101",3770160,3772960,"Because he doesn't want his familyto suspect what he intends to do.","Double Indemnity"
"1102",3773040,3775560,"Do what? Next, he goes onthis trip entirely alone.","Double Indemnity"
"1103",3775640,3779080,"He has to be alone. He hobbles all theway out to the observation platform.","Double Indemnity"
"1104",3779160,3782680,"Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,unless he has a very strong reason.","Double Indemnity"
"1105",3782920,3785880,"Once there, he finds he is notalone. There is a man there.","Double Indemnity"
"1106",3785960,3789520,"What was his name, Keyes? His namewas Jackson. Probably still is.","Double Indemnity"
"1107",3790000,3793560,"So he gets rid of this Jackson withsome flimsy excuse about cigars.","Double Indemnity"
"1108",3793640,3796800,"And then he is alone. Andthen he does it. Does what?","Double Indemnity"
"1109",3796880,3800400,"He jumps. Suicide. In whichcase, the company is not liable.","Double Indemnity"
"1110",3800760,3803520,"You know that, of course.Now, we could go to court...","Double Indemnity"
"1111",3803600,3807240,"I don't know anything. In fact,I don't know why I came here.","Double Indemnity"
"1112",3807440,3810600,"Just a moment, please. I said we couldgo to court. I didn't say we want to.","Double Indemnity"
"1113",3810640,3813440,"What I want to suggest isa compromise on both sides.","Double Indemnity"
"1114",3813520,3815880,"A settlement for a certainsum, a part of the policy value.","Double Indemnity"
"1115",3815920,3819480,"Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came inhere, I had no idea you owed me any money.","Double Indemnity"
"1116",3819560,3821480,"You told me you did.Then you told me you didn't.","Double Indemnity"
"1117",3821560,3823880,"Now you tell me you want to payme a part of it, whatever it is.","Double Indemnity"
"1118",3823960,3826200,"You want to bargain with me,at a time like this.","Double Indemnity"
"1119",3826280,3829480,"I don't like your insinuations about myhusband, and I don't like your methods.","Double Indemnity"
"1120",3829560,3833160,"In fact, I don't like you,Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.","Double Indemnity"
"1121",3836120,3837120,"[Door slamming]","Double Indemnity"
"1122",3837760,3840880,"(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.You sure carried that ball.","Double Indemnity"
"1123",3840960,3842280,"Only you fumbledon the goal line.","Double Indemnity"
"1124",3842320,3845400,"Then you heaved an illegal forwardpass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.","Double Indemnity"
"1125",3845480,3848280,"Now you can't pick yourself up becauseyou haven't got a leg to stand on.","Double Indemnity"
"1126",3848360,3851240,"I haven't, eh? She can go to courtand we can prove it was suicide.","Double Indemnity"
"1127",3851320,3852760,"Oh, can we?","Double Indemnity"
"1128",3852840,3856520,"Mr. Norton, the first thing thatstruck me was that suicide angle.","Double Indemnity"
"1129",3856560,3860160,"Only I dumped it into the wastepaperbasket just three seconds later.","Double Indemnity"
"1130",3860240,3863640,"You know, you ought to take a lookat the statistics on suicide sometime.","Double Indemnity"
"1131",3863720,3866080,"You might learn a little somethingabout the insurance business.","Double Indemnity"
"1132",3866160,3868200,"Mr. Keyes, I was raisedin the insurance business.","Double Indemnity"
"1133",3868240,3869960,"Yeah, in the front office.","Double Indemnity"
"1134",3870000,3873040,"Come now, you've never read anactuarial table in your life, have you?","Double Indemnity"
"1135",3873120,3875280,"Why, they've got 10 volumeson suicide alone.","Double Indemnity"
"1136",3875360,3877080,"Suicide by race, by color,by occupation...","Double Indemnity"
"1137",3877160,3879040,"by sex, by seasons ofthe year, by time of day.","Double Indemnity"
"1138",3879120,3882360,"Suicide, how committed? By poisons,by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.","Double Indemnity"
"1139",3882440,3885000,"Suicide by poison, subdividedby types of poison...","Double Indemnity"
"1140",3885040,3887560,"such as corrosive, irritant,systemic, gaseous, narcotic...","Double Indemnity"
"1141",3887640,3889040,"alkaloid, protein,and so forth.","Double Indemnity"
"1142",3889120,3891720,"Suicide by leaps, subdividedby leaps from high places...","Double Indemnity"
"1143",3891760,3893800,"under the wheels of trains,under the wheels of trucks...","Double Indemnity"
"1144",3893880,3897000,"under the feet of horses, fromsteamboats. But, Mr. Norton...","Double Indemnity"
"1145",3897240,3900640,"of all the cases on record there's notone single case of suicide by leap...","Double Indemnity"
"1146",3900720,3902000,"from the rear endof a moving train.","Double Indemnity"
"1147",3902080,3903760,"And do you know how fastthat train was going...","Double Indemnity"
"1148",3903840,3906680,"at the point where the bodywas found? 15 miles an hour.","Double Indemnity"
"1149",3906760,3908840,"Now how can anybody jump offa slow moving train like that...","Double Indemnity"
"1150",3908880,3911640,"with any kind of expectationthat he would kill himself?","Double Indemnity"
"1151",3911720,3913320,"No. No soap, Mr. Norton.","Double Indemnity"
"1152",3913400,3916360,"We're sunk, and we'll have to paythrough the nose, and you know it.","Double Indemnity"
"1153",3916440,3917960,"May I have this?","Double Indemnity"
"1154",3921200,3922720,"Come on, Walter.","Double Indemnity"
"1155",3925720,3927840,"Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.","Double Indemnity"
"1156",3943600,3945960,"(Walter) I could have hugged youright then and there, Keyes...","Double Indemnity"
"1157",3946000,3947520,"you and your statistics.","Double Indemnity"
"1158",3947600,3950200,"You were the only onewe were really scared of...","Double Indemnity"
"1159",3950280,3952880,"and instead you werealmost playing on our team.","Double Indemnity"
"1160",3953080,3956000,"That evening when I got home,my nerves had eased off.","Double Indemnity"
"1161",3956080,3958000,"I could feel the groundunder my feet again.","Double Indemnity"
"1162",3958080,3960760,"And it looked like easy goingfrom there on in.","Double Indemnity"
"1163",3960840,3963000,"That $100,000 lookedas safe for Phyllis and me...","Double Indemnity"
"1164",3963080,3965640,"as if we had the checkalready deposited in the bank.","Double Indemnity"
"1165",3965680,3967240,"[Phone ringing]","Double Indemnity"
"1166",3971760,3976000,"Hello? Oh, hello, baby.Sure, everything is fine.","Double Indemnity"
"1167",3976800,3978280,"You were wonderfulin Norton's office.","Double Indemnity"
"1168",3978360,3981480,"I felt so funny, I wanted tolook at you all the time.","Double Indemnity"
"1169",3981520,3983960,"How do you think I felt, baby?Where are you?","Double Indemnity"
"1170",3984040,3986520,"At the drugstore.Just a block away.","Double Indemnity"
"1171",3986760,3988760,"Can I come up?Okay. But be careful.","Double Indemnity"
"1172",3988840,3990520,"Don't let anybody see you.","Double Indemnity"
"1173",4001400,4003040,"[Doorbell ringing]","Double Indemnity"
"1174",4015760,4017160,"Hello, Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1175",4022600,4025120,"What's on your mind?That broken leg.","Double Indemnity"
"1176",4025640,4028600,"The guy had a broken leg.What are you talking about?","Double Indemnity"
"1177",4028680,4032040,"Talking about Dietrichson. Hehad accident insurance, didn't he?","Double Indemnity"
"1178",4032320,4034280,"Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?","Double Indemnity"
"1179",4034360,4036240,"So what?And he didn't put in a claim.","Double Indemnity"
"1180",4036280,4039880,"Why didn't he put in a claim?Why? What are you driving at?","Double Indemnity"
"1181",4040080,4044680,"Walter, I had dinner two hoursago and it stuck half way.","Double Indemnity"
"1182",4044720,4046360,"That little man of yoursis acting up again, huh?","Double Indemnity"
"1183",4046440,4048680,"There's something wrongwith the Dietrichson case.","Double Indemnity"
"1184",4048720,4052400,"Why? Because he didn't file a claim?Maybe he just didn't have time.","Double Indemnity"
"1185",4052480,4055360,"Maybe he just didn't know thathe was insured.","Double Indemnity"
"1186",4057440,4058880,"No. No, that couldn't be it.","Double Indemnity"
"1187",4058960,4061040,"You delivered the policyto him personally, didn't you?","Double Indemnity"
"1188",4061120,4062080,"Yeah.You got his check?","Double Indemnity"
"1189",4062160,4063280,"Sure I did.","Double Indemnity"
"1190",4064080,4066880,"Got any bicarbonate of soda?No, I haven't.","Double Indemnity"
"1191",4067600,4071080,"Walter, I've been living withthis little man for 26 years.","Double Indemnity"
"1192",4071600,4074120,"And he's never failed me yet.There's got to be something wrong.","Double Indemnity"
"1193",4074200,4076520,"Well, maybe Norton was right.Maybe it was suicide.","Double Indemnity"
"1194",4076600,4078120,"No. Not suicide.","Double Indemnity"
"1195",4078720,4081640,"But not an accident, either.What else?","Double Indemnity"
"1196",4082160,4083360,"Now look, Walter.","Double Indemnity"
"1197",4083440,4086280,"A guy takes out an accidentpolicy that's worth $100,000...","Double Indemnity"
"1198",4086320,4087360,"if he's killed on a train.","Double Indemnity"
"1199",4087440,4089240,"Then two weeks later,he is killed on a train.","Double Indemnity"
"1200",4089320,4093120,"And not in a train accident, mind you,but falling off some silly observation car.","Double Indemnity"
"1201",4093200,4095760,"Do you know what the mathematicalprobability of that is?","Double Indemnity"
"1202",4095840,4098600,"One out of I don't knowhow many billions.","Double Indemnity"
"1203",4099360,4103840,"And add to that the broken leg. No,it just can't be the way it looks.","Double Indemnity"
"1204",4104360,4108200,"Something has been workedon us. Such as what?","Double Indemnity"
"1205",4115920,4117040,"Murder?","Double Indemnity"
"1206",4117520,4119320,"Don't you have any peppermintor something?","Double Indemnity"
"1207",4119400,4122080,"Sorry. Want a littlesoda water? No, no, no.","Double Indemnity"
"1208",4123400,4124320,"(Walter)Who do you suspect?","Double Indemnity"
"1209",4124400,4126280,"(Keyes) Maybe I like tomake things easy for myself.","Double Indemnity"
"1210",4126320,4128280,"But I always tend to suspectthe beneficiary.","Double Indemnity"
"1211",4128360,4129400,"You mean the wife?Yeah.","Double Indemnity"
"1212",4129480,4131920,"That wide-eyed dame that justdidn't know anything about anything.","Double Indemnity"
"1213",4132000,4133920,"You're crazy, Keyes.She wasn't even on the train.","Double Indemnity"
"1214",4134000,4135240,"I know she wasn't, Walter.","Double Indemnity"
"1215",4135280,4137440,"I don't claim to know how itwas worked, or who worked it...","Double Indemnity"
"1216",4137520,4139840,"but all I know is thatit was worked.","Double Indemnity"
"1217",4139920,4141560,"I've got toget to a drugstore.","Double Indemnity"
"1218",4141640,4144480,"This thing feels likea hunk of concrete inside me.","Double Indemnity"
"1219",4144560,4147120,"Good night, Walter.Good night, Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1220",4147440,4150280,"See you at the officein the morning. Yeah.","Double Indemnity"
"1221",4151280,4153760,"I'd like to move in on herright now, tonight.","Double Indemnity"
"1222",4153840,4157800,"If it wasn't for Norton and hisstriped-pants ideas about company policy...","Double Indemnity"
"1223",4157880,4160440,"I'd have the police after herso fast it'd make her head spin.","Double Indemnity"
"1224",4160520,4162000,"They'd put herthrough the wringer...","Double Indemnity"
"1225",4162080,4164800,"and, brother, the thingsthey would squeeze out.","Double Indemnity"
"1226",4164880,4166800,"Only you haven't got asingle thing to go on, Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1227",4166880,4169080,"Not too much.Just 26 years experience...","Double Indemnity"
"1228",4169160,4173200,"all the percentage there is, andthis hunk of concrete in my stomach.","Double Indemnity"
"1229",4175280,4177480,"Can I haveone of those things?","Double Indemnity"
"1230",4187880,4190240,"Good night, Keyes.So long, Walter.","Double Indemnity"

"1233",4206800,4208880,"It's those stinkinghunches of his.","Double Indemnity"
"1234",4208960,4210240,"And he can't prove anything,can he?","Double Indemnity"
"1235",4210320,4214120,"Not if we're careful. Not if wedon't see each other for a while.","Double Indemnity"
"1236",4216080,4218520,"How long a while?Until this dies down.","Double Indemnity"
"1237",4218600,4219520,"You don't know Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1238",4219600,4221600,"Once he gets his teeth intosomething, he never lets go.","Double Indemnity"
"1239",4221680,4223280,"He'll investigate you,have you shadowed.","Double Indemnity"
"1240",4223360,4226040,"He'll watch youevery minute from now on.","Double Indemnity"
"1241",4226120,4228480,"You afraid, baby?Yes, I'm afraid.","Double Indemnity"
"1242",4229560,4233360,"But not of Keyes. I'm afraid ofus. We're not the same anymore.","Double Indemnity"
"1243",4233440,4236480,"We did it so we could be together, butinstead of that it's pulling us apart.","Double Indemnity"
"1244",4236560,4238240,"Isn't it, Walter?What are you talking about?","Double Indemnity"
"1245",4238320,4241840,"And you don't really carewhether we see each other or not.","Double Indemnity"

"1253",4265760,4267880,"Oh, yes. Come into my office.","Double Indemnity"
"1254",4273960,4276040,"Is it something aboutwhat happened?","Double Indemnity"
"1255",4276080,4279560,"Yes, Mr. Neff.It's about my father's death.","Double Indemnity"
"1256",4280560,4282080,"I'm terribly sorry,Miss Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1257",4285680,4288200,"Lou, do you mind if I use theoffice alone for a few minutes?","Double Indemnity"
"1258",4288240,4290080,"No. It's all yours, Walter.","Double Indemnity"
"1259",4296760,4298240,"Look at me, Mr. Neff.","Double Indemnity"
"1260",4298320,4301640,"I'm not crazy. I'm nothysterical. I'm not even crying.","Double Indemnity"
"1261",4302680,4306000,"But I have the awful feelingthat something is wrong...","Double Indemnity"
"1262",4306320,4309960,"and I had that same feelingonce before, when my mother died.","Double Indemnity"
"1263",4310000,4311000,"When your mother died?","Double Indemnity"
"1264",4311080,4313360,"We were at Lake Arrowhead.That was six years ago.","Double Indemnity"
"1265",4313440,4314400,"We had a cabin there.","Double Indemnity"
"1266",4314480,4318600,"It was winter and very cold. Mymother was very sick with pneumonia.","Double Indemnity"
"1267",4318920,4320560,"She had a nurse with her.","Double Indemnity"
"1268",4320680,4323520,"There were justthe three of us in the cabin.","Double Indemnity"
"1269",4323640,4326240,"One night I got up andwent into my mother's room.","Double Indemnity"
"1270",4326320,4328080,"She was delirious with fever.","Double Indemnity"
"1271",4328160,4331720,"All the bed covers were on thefloor and the windows were wide open.","Double Indemnity"
"1272",4331800,4332920,"The nurse wasn't in the room.","Double Indemnity"
"1273",4333000,4335080,"I ran and covered my mother upas quickly as I could.","Double Indemnity"
"1274",4335160,4337800,"Just then I hearda door open behind me.","Double Indemnity"
"1275",4338400,4340200,"The nurse stood there.","Double Indemnity"
"1276",4340720,4344200,"She didn't say a word, butthere was a look in her eyes...","Double Indemnity"
"1277",4344360,4345960,"I'll never forget.","Double Indemnity"
"1278",4347920,4350920,"Two days later,my mother was dead.","Double Indemnity"
"1279",4354080,4356320,"Do you know whothat nurse was?","Double Indemnity"
"1280",4356520,4358120,"No. Who?Phyllis.","Double Indemnity"
"1281",4358560,4360840,"I tried to tell my father,but I was just a kid then.","Double Indemnity"
"1282",4360880,4363920,"He wouldn't listen to me. Sixmonths later she married him...","Double Indemnity"
"1283",4364000,4368200,"and I kind of talked myself out of theidea she could have done anything like that.","Double Indemnity"
"1284",4368280,4372560,"But now it's all back again, now thatsomething's happened to my father, too.","Double Indemnity"
"1285",4372640,4376320,"You're not making sense, MissDietrichson. Your father fell off a train.","Double Indemnity"
"1286",4376400,4379280,"Yes, and two days before he fell offthat train, what was Phyllis doing?","Double Indemnity"
"1287",4379360,4381760,"She was in her room in front ofa mirror, with a black hat on...","Double Indemnity"
"1288",4381840,4383080,"pinning a black veil to it.","Double Indemnity"
"1289",4383160,4386440,"As if she couldn't wait to seehow she would look in mourning.","Double Indemnity"
"1290",4386520,4388480,"You've had a pretty bad shock,Miss Dietrichson.","Double Indemnity"
"1291",4388560,4390120,"Aren't you justimagining these things?","Double Indemnity"
"1292",4390200,4391560,"I caught her eyesin the mirror.","Double Indemnity"
"1293",4391640,4394560,"They had that look in themthey had before my mother died.","Double Indemnity"
"1294",4394640,4396040,"That same look.","Double Indemnity"
"1295",4396720,4398440,"You don't likeyour stepmother, do you?","Double Indemnity"
"1296",4398480,4400240,"Isn't it just becauseshe is your stepmother?","Double Indemnity"
"1297",4400320,4402640,"I loathe her because she didit. She did it for the money.","Double Indemnity"
"1298",4402720,4404960,"Only you're not going topay her, are you, Mr. Neff?","Double Indemnity"
"1299",4405040,4408040,"She's not going to get away with itthis time, because I'm going to speak up.","Double Indemnity"
"1300",4408080,4409520,"I'm going totell everything I know.","Double Indemnity"
"1301",4409600,4413760,"You'd better be careful, saying thingslike... I'm not afraid. You'll see.","Double Indemnity"
"1302",4414800,4416120,"[Sobbing]","Double Indemnity"
"1303",4421720,4423000,"I'm sorry.","Double Indemnity"
"1304",4426240,4428440,"I didn't mean toact like this.","Double Indemnity"
"1305",4429680,4432600,"All this that you've been tellingme, who else have you told?","Double Indemnity"
"1306",4432680,4433800,"No one.","Double Indemnity"
"1307",4433960,4436320,"How about your stepmother?Of course not.","Double Indemnity"
"1308",4437280,4438720,"I've moved out.","Double Indemnity"
"1309",4439800,4441840,"I'm not livingat home anymore.","Double Indemnity"
"1310",4441920,4444360,"And you haven't told thatboyfriend of yours? Zachetti?","Double Indemnity"
"1311",4444440,4447240,"I'm not seeing him anymore.We had a fight.","Double Indemnity"
"1312",4448760,4450520,"Where are you living now?","Double Indemnity"
"1313",4450600,4453440,"I got myself a littleapartment in Hollywood.","Double Indemnity"
"1314",4453720,4456560,"Four walls, and you justsit and look at them?","Double Indemnity"
"1315",4457400,4458840,"Yes, Mr. Neff.","Double Indemnity"
"1316",4461560,4463040,"(Walter) So that eveningI took her to dinner...","Double Indemnity"
"1317",4463120,4466600,"at a Mexican restaurant down on OlveraStreet where nobody would see us.","Double Indemnity"
"1318",4466680,4468600,"I wanted to cheer her up.","Double Indemnity"
"1319",4469000,4472280,"The next day was Sunday and wewent for a ride down to the beach.","Double Indemnity"
"1320",4472360,4474960,"She had loosened up a bit,she was even laughing.","Double Indemnity"
"1321",4475040,4478440,"I had to make sure that she wouldn't tellthat stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.","Double Indemnity"
"1322",4478520,4481320,"It was dynamite,whether it was true or not.","Double Indemnity"
"1323",4481520,4483280,"And I had no chanceto talk to Phyllis.","Double Indemnity"
"1324",4483360,4485480,"You were watching herlike a hawk, Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1325",4485520,4489680,"I couldn't even phone her because Iwas afraid you had the wires tapped.","Double Indemnity"
"1326",4489880,4493720,"Monday morning there was a note on mydesk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1327",4493800,4496640,"For a minute I wonderedif it could be about Lola.","Double Indemnity"
"1328",4496720,4498120,"It was worse.","Double Indemnity"
"1329",4498640,4502440,"Outside your door was the lastguy in the world I wanted to see.","Double Indemnity"
"1330",4511240,4513120,"Come in. Come in, Walter.","Double Indemnity"
"1331",4514600,4517360,"Hello, Keyes.I want to ask you something.","Double Indemnity"
"1332",4517800,4519560,"After all the yearswe've known each other...","Double Indemnity"
"1333",4519640,4521480,"do you mind if I makea rather blunt statement?","Double Indemnity"
"1334",4521560,4523080,"About what?About me.","Double Indemnity"
"1335",4523680,4526240,"Walter, I'm a very great man.Yeah?","Double Indemnity"
"1336",4526320,4528960,"This Dietrichson business,it's murder...","Double Indemnity"
"1337",4529040,4530920,"and murders don't comeany neater.","Double Indemnity"
"1338",4531000,4533760,"As fancy a piece of homicideas anybody ever ran into...","Double Indemnity"
"1339",4533840,4536000,"smart, tricky,almost perfect, but...","Double Indemnity"
"1340",4536880,4539240,"I think Papa has itall figured out.","Double Indemnity"
"1341",4539280,4542960,"Figured out and wrapped up intissue paper with pink ribbons on it.","Double Indemnity"
"1342",4543040,4545640,"Go ahead. I'm listening.You know what?","Double Indemnity"
"1343",4546000,4548840,"That guy Dietrichsonwas never on the train.","Double Indemnity"
"1344",4549960,4551880,"He wasn't?No, he wasn't.","Double Indemnity"
"1345",4553400,4555600,"Now look, Walter. You can'tbe sure of killing a man...","Double Indemnity"
"1346",4555680,4558680,"by throwing him off a trainthat's going 15 miles an hour.","Double Indemnity"
"1347",4558760,4561120,"The only way you can be sureis to kill him first...","Double Indemnity"
"1348",4561200,4563040,"and then throwhis body on the tracks.","Double Indemnity"
"1349",4563120,4565200,"Now that would mean eitherkilling him on the train...","Double Indemnity"
"1350",4565280,4568840,"or, and this is where it really getsfancy, you kill him somewhere else...","Double Indemnity"
"1351",4568920,4570080,"and put him on the tracks.","Double Indemnity"
"1352",4570160,4573280,"Two possibilities, and Ipersonally buy the second.","Double Indemnity"
"1353",4574480,4575920,"You're way ahead of me,Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1354",4576040,4577720,"Well, look, Walter,it was like this.","Double Indemnity"
"1355",4578000,4581480,"They killed the guy, the wifeand a somebody else...","Double Indemnity"
"1356",4581760,4585000,"and the somebody else took the crutchesand went on the train as Dietrichson...","Double Indemnity"
"1357",4585080,4586760,"then the somebodyelse jumped off...","Double Indemnity"
"1358",4586840,4589280,"then they put the body on thetracks where the train had passed.","Double Indemnity"
"1359",4589360,4591920,"An impersonation, see?A cinch to work.","Double Indemnity"
"1360",4592720,4594760,"Because it was night,very few people were about...","Double Indemnity"
"1361",4594800,4596280,"they have the crutchesto stare at...","Double Indemnity"
"1362",4596360,4598720,"they never really lookedat the man at all.","Double Indemnity"
"1363",4598800,4600840,"Fancy all right, Keyes, butmaybe it's a little too fancy.","Double Indemnity"
"1364",4600920,4604160,"Is it? I tell you, it allfits together like a watch.","Double Indemnity"
"1365",4604800,4606600,"Now let's see what we havein the way of proof.","Double Indemnity"
"1366",4606680,4609480,"The only guy who really got a goodlook at this supposed Dietrichson...","Double Indemnity"
"1367",4609520,4611560,"is sittingright outside my office.","Double Indemnity"
"1368",4611640,4614920,"I took the trouble to bringhim down here from Oregon.","Double Indemnity"
"1369",4616600,4619320,"Come here, Mr. Jackson.Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.","Double Indemnity"
"1370",4619400,4621000,"These are fine cigarsyou smoke.","Double Indemnity"
"1371",4621080,4622760,"Two for a quarter.That's what I said.","Double Indemnity"
"1372",4622800,4624320,"Well, did you studythose photographs?","Double Indemnity"
"1373",4624400,4626320,"Yes, indeed.I studied them thoroughly.","Double Indemnity"
"1374",4626400,4628160,"Very thoroughly.Have you made up your mind?","Double Indemnity"
"1375",4628240,4630120,"Mister Keyes, I'm a Medfordman. Medford, Oregon.","Double Indemnity"
"1376",4630200,4632280,"Up in Medford we take our timemaking up our mind.","Double Indemnity"
"1377",4632360,4635240,"Well, we're not in Medford now.We're in a hurry. Let's have it.","Double Indemnity"
"1378",4635320,4637480,"Are these photographsof the late Mr. Dietrichson?","Double Indemnity"
"1379",4637520,4638480,"Yes.","Double Indemnity"
"1380",4639000,4641120,"Then my answer is no.What do you mean, no?","Double Indemnity"
"1381",4641200,4643280,"I mean, this is notthe man that was on the train.","Double Indemnity"
"1382",4643360,4644520,"Will you swear to that?","Double Indemnity"
"1383",4644560,4646480,"Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.Medford, Oregon.","Double Indemnity"
"1384",4646560,4648840,"If I say it, I mean it. If Imean it, of course I'll swear it.","Double Indemnity"
"1385",4648880,4650440,"There you are, Walter.There's your proof.","Double Indemnity"
"1386",4650520,4652120,"This is Mr. Neff,one of our salesmen.","Double Indemnity"
"1387",4652200,4654080,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.Pleased, indeed.","Double Indemnity"
"1388",4654160,4655480,"How are you?Very fine, thank you.","Double Indemnity"
"1389",4655560,4657800,"Never was better.Sit down, Mr. Jackson.","Double Indemnity"
"1390",4657880,4661120,"Just how would you describe the manyou saw on the observation platform?","Double Indemnity"
"1391",4661200,4663800,"Well, I'm pretty surehe was a younger man...","Double Indemnity"
"1392",4663920,4666760,"about 10 or 15 years youngerthan the man in these photographs.","Double Indemnity"
"1393",4666800,4668760,"Dietrichson was about 50,wasn't he, Walter?","Double Indemnity"
"1394",4668840,4671120,"Fifty-one,according to the policy.","Double Indemnity"
"1395",4671200,4673960,"The man I saw was nothing like51 years old.","Double Indemnity"
"1396",4674160,4676560,"Of course, it was pretty darkout on that platform.","Double Indemnity"
"1397",4676640,4678800,"Come to think of it, he triedto keep his back towards me.","Double Indemnity"
"1398",4678880,4681400,"But I'm positive just thesame. Thank you, Jackson.","Double Indemnity"
"1399",4681480,4683800,"Of course, you understand thismatter is strictly confidential?","Double Indemnity"

"1428",4759480,4762120,"Murder's never perfect. Alwayscomes apart sooner or later.","Double Indemnity"
"1429",4762160,4764520,"And when two people areinvolved, it's usually sooner.","Double Indemnity"
"1430",4764600,4767400,"Now, we know the Dietrichson dameis in it, and a somebody else.","Double Indemnity"
"1431",4767440,4769400,"Pretty soon we'll knowwho that somebody else is.","Double Indemnity"
"1432",4769480,4772200,"He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,somewhere, they've got to meet.","Double Indemnity"
"1433",4772280,4773520,"Their emotionsare all kicked up.","Double Indemnity"
"1434",4773600,4776880,"Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.They can't keep away from each other.","Double Indemnity"
"1435",4776960,4779320,"They may think it's twice as safebecause there are two of them.","Double Indemnity"
"1436",4779400,4780720,"But it isn't twice as safe.","Double Indemnity"
"1437",4780800,4783840,"It's 10 times twice as dangerous.They've committed a murder...","Double Indemnity"
"1438",4783920,4785960,"and it's not like takinga trolley ride together...","Double Indemnity"
"1439",4786000,4787720,"where they can get offat different stops.","Double Indemnity"
"1440",4787760,4789960,"They're stuck with each otherand they've got to ride...","Double Indemnity"
"1441",4790000,4791400,"all the way tothe end of the line.","Double Indemnity"
"1442",4791480,4793720,"And it's a one-way trip, andthe last stop is the cemetery.","Double Indemnity"

"1492",4976960,4979400,"We went into this together, we'recoming out at the end together.","Double Indemnity"
"1493",4979480,4983080,"It's straight down the linefor both of us, remember?","Double Indemnity"
"1494",4989520,4991080,"(Walter)Yes, I remembered.","Double Indemnity"
"1495",4992400,4995560,"Just like I rememberedwhat you had told me, Keyes...","Double Indemnity"

"1498",5001920,5003720,"...where the cemetery was.","Double Indemnity"
"1499",5005120,5008240,"And then I got to thinkingwhat cemeteries are for.","Double Indemnity"
"1500",5008880,5011040,"They're to put dead people in.","Double Indemnity"
"1501",5012720,5016200,"I guess that was the first time Iever thought about Phyllis that way.","Double Indemnity"
"1502",5016280,5017760,"Dead, I mean.","Double Indemnity"
"1503",5018880,5021360,"And how it would beif she were dead.","Double Indemnity"

"1627",5564080,5565800,"Come on, baby,I just got into this thing...","Double Indemnity"
"1628",5565880,5568400,"because I happen to know a littlesomething about insurance, didn't I?","Double Indemnity"
"1629",5568480,5569440,"I was a sucker.","Double Indemnity"
"1630",5569520,5572200,"I'd have been brushed off just as soonas you got your hands on the money.","Double Indemnity"
"1631",5572240,5574800,"Nobody wanted to brush youoff. Save it. I'm telling this.","Double Indemnity"

"1633",5577280,5578800,"That's not true.","Double Indemnity"
"1634",5578880,5581880,"Doesn't make any differenceif it's true or not.","Double Indemnity"
"1635",5583080,5586440,"The point is, Keyes believes Zachettiis the one he's been looking for.","Double Indemnity"

"1639",5601880,5603120,"That's what Keyes thinks.","Double Indemnity"
"1640",5603200,5605360,"And what's good enough forKeyes is good enough for me.","Double Indemnity"
"1641",5605440,5609600,"Maybe it's not good enough for me,Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.","Double Indemnity"
"1642",5609640,5611440,"Maybe I'd rather talk.","Double Indemnity"
"1643",5611560,5615880,"Sometimes people are where they can'ttalk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.","Double Indemnity"
"1644",5616200,5620080,"And if it was you, they'd charge thatup to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?","Double Indemnity"
"1645",5620160,5623720,"Sure they would, and that'sjust what's gonna happen, baby.","Double Indemnity"
"1646",5624120,5626520,"'Cause he's coming heretonight, in about 15 minutes.","Double Indemnity"
"1647",5626600,5629920,"With the cops right behindhim. It's all taken care of.","Double Indemnity"
"1648",5630960,5633160,"That would make everythinglovely for you, wouldn't it?","Double Indemnity"
"1649",5633200,5636960,"Right. And it's got to be done beforethat suit of yours comes to trial...","Double Indemnity"
"1650",5637000,5638440,"and Lola gets a chanceto sound off...","Double Indemnity"
"1651",5638640,5641600,"before they trip you up on the stand, andyou start to go in drag me down with you.","Double Indemnity"
"1652",5641640,5643880,"Maybe I had Zachetti here so theywon't get a chance to trip me up...","Double Indemnity"
"1653",5643960,5645320,"so we can get the moneyand be together.","Double Indemnity"

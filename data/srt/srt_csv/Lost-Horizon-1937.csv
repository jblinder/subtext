"435",2754606,2757097,"What brought them there,unless it was to meet us?","Lost Horizon"
"436",2757192,2759813,"Chang's first question was about the pilot.","Lost Horizon"
"437",2760570,2763856,"There must be some connectionbetween the plane and this place.","Lost Horizon"

"508",3085938,3089104,"That, my dear Conway,is the story of a remarkable man.","Lost Horizon"

"510",3093153,3096356,"A Belgian priestby the name of Father Perrault.","Lost Horizon"
"511",3098408,3102655,"The first European to find this placeand a very great man indeed.","Lost Horizon"
"512",3103205,3105530,"He is responsiblefor everything you see here.","Lost Horizon"
"513",3105624,3108376,"He built Shangri-La, taught the natives...","Lost Horizon"
"514",3108627,3111248,"...and began our collection of art.","Lost Horizon"
"515",3112339,3114877,"In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.","Lost Horizon"
"516",3116718,3118296,"When was all this?","Lost Horizon"
"517",3119805,3123933,"Way back in 1713, I think it was...","Lost Horizon"
"518",3124685,3128634,"...that Father Perrault stumbledinto the valley, half-frozen to death.","Lost Horizon"
"519",3130023,3132728,"It was typical of the manthat one leg being frozen...","Lost Horizon"
"520",3132818,3136483,"...and there being no doctors here,he amputated the leg himself.","Lost Horizon"
"521",3138198,3140274,"He amputated his own leg?","Lost Horizon"
"522",3141577,3145076,"Oddly enough, when he had learnedto understand their language...","Lost Horizon"
"523",3145163,3148081,"...the natives told himhe could have saved his leg.","Lost Horizon"
"524",3148166,3150242,"It would've healed without amputation.","Lost Horizon"

"526",3155090,3158091,"You see, a perfect body in perfect healthwas the rule here.","Lost Horizon"
"527",3158176,3160169,"They've never known anything different.","Lost Horizon"

"529",3164474,3165933,"Well, is it?","Lost Horizon"
"530",3166935,3169094,"Rather astonishingly so, yes.","Lost Horizon"
"531",3169271,3172640,"Particularly in the caseof Father Perrault himself.","Lost Horizon"
"532",3172733,3175687,"When he and the nativeshad finished building Shangri-La...","Lost Horizon"
"533",3175777,3178185,"...he was 108 years oldand still very active...","Lost Horizon"

"538",3188415,3189578,"Forgive me.","Lost Horizon"
"539",3189750,3194328,"I should've told you it's quite common hereto live to a very ripe old age.","Lost Horizon"
"540",3194421,3197588,"Climate, diet, mountain water,you might say.","Lost Horizon"
"541",3198550,3202927,"But we like to believe it isthe absence of struggle in the way we live.","Lost Horizon"
"542",3203639,3207886,"In your countries, on the other hand,how often do you hear the expression:","Lost Horizon"

"544",3211813,3213806,"- Very often.- And very true.","Lost Horizon"
"545",3214066,3216604,"Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter.","Lost Horizon"
"546",3216693,3221023,"Not so much by natural death,as by indirect suicide.","Lost Horizon"
"547",3221907,3224196,"That's all very fine if it works out.","Lost Horizon"
"548",3224284,3225944,"A little amazing, of course.","Lost Horizon"
"549",3226036,3228159,"You surprise me.","Lost Horizon"

"553",3236838,3240539,"...who have dreamedand written so much about better worlds.","Lost Horizon"
"554",3240842,3245006,"Or is it that you fail to recogniseone of your own dreams when you see it?","Lost Horizon"

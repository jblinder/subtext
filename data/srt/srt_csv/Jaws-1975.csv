"459",2067523,2068733,"Is Ben gettingplenty of pictures?","Jaws"
"460",2068817,2070025,"Oh, you bet he is.","Jaws"
"461",2070152,2071735,"What is thisbite radius crap?","Jaws"
"462",2071820,2073195,"That is a big mouth.","Jaws"
"463",2073989,2075239,"You stuffyour frigging head
in there, man,","Jaws"
"464",2075322,2078324,"and find out ifit's a man-eater.","Jaws"
"465",2082496,2084831,"All I'm saying isthat it may not be
the shark.","Jaws"
"466",2084916,2086083,"It's just a slight...","Jaws"
"467",2086168,2089628,"I want you to meet Matt.This is Larry Vaughn,
our mayor.","Jaws"

"470",2092715,2094340,"Terrific, huh, Mayor?","Jaws"
"471",2095885,2098721,"There are all kinds ofsharks in the waters.","Jaws"
"472",2098804,2101014,"Hammerheads,white tips,
blues, makos.","Jaws"
"473",2101432,2104101,"And the chancesthat these bozos
got the exact shark...","Jaws"
"474",2104186,2106103,"There are no othersharks like this here.","Jaws"
"475",2106188,2108105,"It's 100-to-1.","Jaws"
"476",2108690,2112818,"I'm not saying thatthis is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.","Jaws"
"477",2112902,2115737,"It's a man-eater.It's extremely rare
for these waters.","Jaws"
"478",2115864,2118364,"But the fact is,the bite radius
on this animal","Jaws"
"479",2118449,2120909,"is differentthan the wounds
on the victim.","Jaws"
"480",2122369,2125079,"I want to be sure.You want to be sure.","Jaws"
"481",2125164,2126706,"We all want tobe sure, okay?","Jaws"
"482",2126791,2128416,"What I want to dois very simple.","Jaws"
"483",2128543,2131295,"The digestive systemof this animal
is very slow.","Jaws"
"484",2131378,2132505,"Let's cut it open.","Jaws"
"485",2132588,2134507,"Whatever it's eatenin the last 24 hours","Jaws"
"486",2134590,2136050,"is bound tostill be in there.","Jaws"
"487",2136134,2138092,"And then we'll be sure.","Jaws"
"488",2143891,2146143,"It may be the only wayto confirm it.","Jaws"
"489",2146228,2148561,"Look, fellows,let's be reasonable.","Jaws"
"490",2149063,2151273,"This is notthe time or the place","Jaws"
"491",2151398,2154943,"to perform some kindof a half-assed autopsy
on a fish.","Jaws"
"492",2155820,2159532,"And I am notgoing to stand here
and see that thing cut open","Jaws"
"493",2159615,2163494,"and see thatlittle Kintner boy

"498",2195360,2196985,"And you knew it.","Jaws"
"499",2197945,2200655,"You knew there wasa shark out there.","Jaws"
"500",2202784,2204617,"You knewit was dangerous.","Jaws"
"501",2204869,2207621,"But you let peoplego swimming anyway.","Jaws"
"502",2212001,2214295,"You knew all those things,","Jaws"
"503",2217798,2220050,"but still my boyis dead now.","Jaws"
"504",2224389,2227307,"And there's nothingyou can do about it.","Jaws"
"505",2232981,2234565,"My boy is dead.","Jaws"
"506",2240155,2242322,"I wanted youto know that.","Jaws"

"532",2420335,2422293,"Is anyone eating this?","Jaws"
"533",2422378,2423586,"No.","Jaws"
"534",2431804,2434514,"My husband tells meyou're in sharks.","Jaws"
"535",2437143,2440144,"Excuse me. Yes.I've never heard it

"540",2446110,2448362,"When I was 12 years old,my father got me a boat","Jaws"
"541",2448445,2450197,"and I went fishingoff of Cape Cod.","Jaws"
"542",2450280,2452449,"I hooked a scup andas I was reeling it in","Jaws"
"543",2452534,2455369,"I hooked a 4.5 footbaby thresher shark","Jaws"
"544",2455452,2457079,"who proceededto eat my boat.","Jaws"
"545",2458581,2462208,"He ate my oar, hooks,and my seat cushions.","Jaws"
"546",2462293,2463668,"He turned an inboardinto an outboard","Jaws"
"547",2463753,2467088,"scared me to death,and I swam back to shore.","Jaws"
"548",2467172,2469632,"When I was on the beach,I turned around","Jaws"
"549",2469717,2471677,"and actually sawmy boat being
taken apart.","Jaws"
"550",2471760,2474346,"Ever since then,I have been
studying sharks","Jaws"
"551",2474429,2478182,"and that's why I knowthat I'm going to go
to the Institute tomorrow","Jaws"
"552",2478268,2480853,"and tell themthat you still have
a shark problem here.","Jaws"
"553",2480978,2482896,"Why do you haveto tell them that?
Sorry.","Jaws"
"554",2482981,2484606,"I'm sorry,I thought that...","Jaws"
"555",2484690,2485983,"You told methe shark was caught.","Jaws"
"556",2486067,2488652,"I heard it on the news.I heard it on
the Cape station.","Jaws"
"557",2488735,2491320,"They caught a shark,not the shark.","Jaws"
"558",2491822,2494407,"Not the shark thatkilled Chrissie Watkins.","Jaws"
"559",2494617,2497286,"And probably not the sharkthat killed the little boy.","Jaws"
"560",2497369,2500164,"Which I wantedto prove today by
cutting the shark open...","Jaws"
"561",2500248,2503333,"You may want to letthat breathe... Nothing.","Jaws"
"562",2519934,2523269,"You know, you'll bethe only rational man","Jaws"
"563",2523353,2525063,"left on this islandafter I leave tomorrow.","Jaws"
"564",2525773,2527315,"Where are you going?","Jaws"
"565",2528610,2530360,"I am goingon the Aurora.","Jaws"
"566",2530445,2531862,"The Aurora?What is that?","Jaws"
"567",2531945,2534864,"It's a floating asylumfor shark addicts.","Jaws"
"568",2534949,2536992,"It's pure research,18 months at sea.","Jaws"
"569",2537409,2540954,"Martin hates boats.Martin hates water.","Jaws"
"570",2541581,2545666,"Martin sits in his carwhen we go on the ferry
to the mainland.","Jaws"
"571",2545960,2547960,"I guess it'sa childhood thing.","Jaws"
"572",2548045,2549713,"There's a clinical namefor it, isn't there?","Jaws"
"573",2549797,2551255,"Drowning.","Jaws"
"574",2552007,2553967,"Is it true that mostpeople get attacked","Jaws"
"575",2554052,2556302,"by sharks inthree feet of water","Jaws"
"576",2556387,2558012,"about 10 feetfrom the beach?","Jaws"
"577",2558097,2559181,"Yeah.","Jaws"
"578",2559766,2563309,"And that beforepeople started to swim
for recreation...","Jaws"
"579",2563393,2566563,"I mean, before sharksknew what they were missing","Jaws"
"580",2566648,2569942,"that a lotof these attacks
weren't reported?","Jaws"
"581",2570025,2571275,"That's right.","Jaws"
"582",2573362,2576155,"Now this sharkthat swims alone","Jaws"
"583",2576282,2577449,"what's it called?Rogue.","Jaws"
"584",2577532,2578951,"Rogue, yeah.","Jaws"
"585",2579409,2582496,"This guy,he keeps swimming around","Jaws"
"586",2582579,2584373,"in a place wherethe feeding is good","Jaws"
"587",2584456,2586333,"until the foodsupply is gone, right?","Jaws"
"588",2586416,2587918,"That's calledterritoriality.","Jaws"
"589",2588001,2591255,"It's just a theory thatI happen to agree with.","Jaws"
"590",2593840,2595425,"Then why don't wehave one more drink","Jaws"
"591",2595510,2598010,"and go downand cut that shark open?","Jaws"
"592",2598512,2601222,"Martin?Can you do that?","Jaws"
"593",2605061,2608063,"I can do anything.I'm the Chief of Police.","Jaws"
"594",2614570,2617197,"We start inthe alimentary canal","Jaws"
"595",2618699,2621242,"and openthe digestive tract.","Jaws"
"596",2651065,2652148,"Just like I thought.","Jaws"
"597",2652233,2653233,"What?","Jaws"
"598",2654235,2657570,"Came up in the Gulf Stream,from southern waters.","Jaws"
"599",2662869,2664161,"He didn't eat a car,did he?","Jaws"
"600",2664244,2665369,"No.","Jaws"
"601",2665704,2668456,"Tiger shark'slike a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.","Jaws"
"602",2668541,2671501,"Somebody probablythrew that in the river.","Jaws"
"603",2677800,2679175,"That's it.","Jaws"
"604",2681012,2684097,"I've got toclose the beach,
call the Mayor.","Jaws"

"607",2690021,2691813,"with a mouthabout this big.","Jaws"
"608",2696318,2698487,"How do we confirm thatby morning?","Jaws"
"609",2699322,2703324,"If he is a rogue,and there's any truth
to territoriality at all","Jaws"
"610",2703409,2705202,"we got a good chanceof spotting him","Jaws"
"611",2705286,2706994,"between Cape Scottand South Beach.","Jaws"
"612",2707079,2708204,"Where are you going?","Jaws"
"613",2708289,2709706,"To find him.He's a night feeder.","Jaws"
"614",2709831,2710831,"On the water?","Jaws"
"615",2710916,2712416,"We're not gonnafind him on the land.","Jaws"

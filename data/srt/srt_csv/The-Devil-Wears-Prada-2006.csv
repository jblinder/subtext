"290",1310375,1313173,"No. And I've seen all this before.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"291",1313278,1316179,"Theyskens is trying to reinventthe drop waist, so actually it's-","The Devil Wears Prada"
"292",1316281,1319341,"- Where are all the other dresses?- We have some right here.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"293",1319451,1322682,"- Stand, watch and listen.- And I think it can be very interesting-","The Devil Wears Prada"
"294",1322788,1327122,"No. No, I just-It's just baffling to me.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"295",1327225,1330717,"Why is it so impossibleto put together a decent run-through?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"296",1330829,1335698,"You people have had hours and hoursto prepare. It's just so confusing to me.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"297",1335801,1337826,"Where are the advertisers?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"298",1337936,1341064,"- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.- We need more, don't we?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"299",1341173,1345075,"- Oh. This is-This might be-What do you think of- - Yeah.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"300",1345177,1346735,"Well, you know me.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"301",1346845,1349712,"Give me a full ballerina skirtand a hint of saloon and I'm on board.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"302",1349815,1353251,"- But do you think it's too much like-- Like the Lacroix from July?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"303",1353352,1356287,"I thought that, but no, not withthe right accessories. It should work.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"304",1356388,1360916,"Where are the belts for this dre-Why is no one ready?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"305",1361026,1364325,"Here. It's a tough call.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"306",1364429,1366590,"- They're so different.- Hmm.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"307",1371803,1373566,"Something funny?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"308",1377175,1380144,"No. No, no. Nothing's-","The Devil Wears Prada"
"309",1380245,1384113,"You know, it's just that both those beltslook exactly the same to me.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"310",1384216,1388380,"You know, I'm still learningabout this stuff and, uh-","The Devil Wears Prada"
"311",1388487,1391251,"""This... stuff""?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"312",1391356,1394917,"Oh. Okay. I see.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"313",1395026,1397221,"You think this has nothingto do with you.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"314",1397329,1400662,"You go to your closet...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"315",1400766,1405430,"and you select- I don't know-that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"316",1405537,1408404,"because you're trying to tell the worldthat you take yourself too seriously...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"317",1408507,1410873,"to care about whatyou put on your back.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"318",1410976,1414104,"But what you don't knowis that that sweater is not just blue.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"319",1414212,1416737,"It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"320",1416848,1419009,"It's actually cerulean.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"321",1419117,1421176,"And you're also blithely unawareof the fact...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"322",1421286,1425586,"that in 2002, Oscar de la Rentadid a collection of cerulean gowns.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"323",1425690,1428215,"And then I think it wasYves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-","The Devil Wears Prada"
"324",1428326,1430294,"who showed cerulean military jackets?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"325",1430395,1432795,"- I think we need a jacket here.- Mmm.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"326",1432898,1436698,"And then cerulean quickly showed upin the collections of eight different designers.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"327",1436802,1440033,"And then it, uh, filtered downthrough the department stores...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"328",1440138,1444199,"and then trickled on downinto some tragic Casual Corner...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"329",1444309,1447437,"where you, no doubt,fished it out of some clearance bin.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"330",1447546,1450208,"However, that blue representsmillions of dollars...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"331",1450315,1452783,"and countless jobs...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"332",1452884,1455910,"and it's sort of comical how you thinkthat you've made a choice...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"333",1456021,1457989,"that exempts youfrom the fashion industry...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"334",1458089,1459989,"when, in fact...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"335",1460091,1464494,"you're wearing a sweater that was selectedfor you by the people in this room...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"336",1464596,1467326,"from a pile of stuff.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"337",1467499,1470059,"So then I said,""No, I couldn't see the difference...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"338",1470168,1472466,"between the twoabsolutely identical belts""...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"339",1472571,1474539,"and you should have seenthe look she gave me!","The Devil Wears Prada"
"340",1474639,1476698,"I thought the fleshwas gonna melt off her face.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"341",1476808,1479368,"It's not funny.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"342",1479478,1483676,"She's not happy unless everyone around heris panicked, nauseous or suicidal.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"343",1483782,1486717,"And the Clackers just worship her.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"344",1486818,1488718,"- The who?- They call them Clackers.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"345",1488820,1492119,"The sound that their stilettos makein the marble lobby.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"346",1492224,1494192,"It's like,""Clack, clack, clack. clack, clack. ""","The Devil Wears Prada"
"347",1494292,1498023,"And they all act likethey're curing cancer or something.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"348",1498129,1501690,"The amount of time and energy...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"349",1501800,1506203,"that these people spend on these insignificant,minute details, and for what?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"350",1506304,1509899,"So that tomorrow they can spendanother $300,000 reshooting something...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"351",1510008,1511999,"that was probably fine to begin with...","The Devil Wears Prada"
"352",1512110,1514908,"to sell people things they don't need!","The Devil Wears Prada"
"353",1515013,1518073,"God!","The Devil Wears Prada"
"354",1518183,1521414,"- I'm not even hungry anymore.- What?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"355",1521520,1524421,"- That is why those girls are so skinny.- Oh. No, no, no.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"356",1524523,1527014,"Give me that. There's, like,eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"357",1527125,1530151,"You know what?","The Devil Wears Prada"
"358",1531830,1534355,"I just have to stick it out for a year.One year.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"359",1534466,1537094,"And then I can dowhat I came to New York to do.","The Devil Wears Prada"
"360",1537202,1540467,"But I can't let Miranda get to me.I won't.","The Devil Wears Prada"

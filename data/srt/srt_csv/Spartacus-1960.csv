"1417",8485622,8487823,"No.","Spartacus"
"1418",8489343,8492143,"But no matter how many timeswe beat them...","Spartacus"
"1419",8492222,8495983,"they still seem to haveanother army to send against us.","Spartacus"
"1420",8496063,8497903,"And another.","Spartacus"
"1421",8500263,8503863,"Varinia, it just seemslike we've started something...","Spartacus"

"1443",8606549,8609349,"- Yes, I did.- That was so strong. Does it hurt you?","Spartacus"
"1444",8610388,8612388,"That was so strong.","Spartacus"
"1445",8978807,8981207,"Lucullus and Pompey.","Spartacus"
"1446",9190777,9192736,"Have we a count of prisoners?","Spartacus"
"1447",9192816,9195377,"We haven't madethe final count, sir.","Spartacus"
"1448",9195457,9198416,"I bring a messagefrom your master...","Spartacus"

"1454",9215458,9217458,"and slaves you remain.","Spartacus"
"1455",9217538,9220817,"But the terrible penaltyof crucifixion...","Spartacus"
"1456",9220897,9222897,"has been set aside...","Spartacus"
"1457",9222977,9227099,"on the single conditionthat you identify the body...","Spartacus"
"1458",9227179,9231779,"or the living personof the slave called Spartacus.","Spartacus"
"1459",9243779,9246379,"- I'm Spartacus!- I'm Spartacus!","Spartacus"
"1460",9289422,9292422,"Forgive me for being one of the lastto congratulate you, Your Nobility.","Spartacus"
"1461",9292502,9295221,"There's an ugly rumourgoing round the camp...","Spartacus"
"1462",9295301,9297902,"that the prisonersare to be crucified.","Spartacus"
"1463",9298621,9300422,"That is true.","Spartacus"
"1464",9301781,9303781,"Perhaps this is the momentto remind Your Highness...","Spartacus"
"1465",9303861,9307262,"that yesterday you promised me I couldbe the agent in their auctioning.","Spartacus"
"1466",9307342,9310942,"Last night you promisedSpartacus to me! Where is he?","Spartacus"

"1473",9349504,9350704,"Yes.","Spartacus"
"1474",9351225,9353024,"Where is Spartacus?","Spartacus"
"1475",9357065,9358665,"Dead.","Spartacus"
"1476",9359225,9361225,"Did you see him killed?","Spartacus"
"1477",9365825,9367104,"Yes.","Spartacus"
"1478",9368825,9372306,"You're lying. Where is he?","Spartacus"
"1479",9376865,9379066,"At least here is someoneworth selling, Your Enormity.","Spartacus"
"1480",9379146,9381906,"I'll even take the childas an investment.","Spartacus"
"1481",9383226,9385626,"- How many women have been taken?- Under forty, sir.","Spartacus"
"1482",9385706,9388665,"Most of those who weren't killed haverun to the hills with their children.","Spartacus"
"1483",9388745,9390945,"You may sell all the others,but not this woman.","Spartacus"
"1484",9391025,9392986,"But you haven't seenthe others, Your Magnitude.","Spartacus"
"1485",9393066,9395867,"They're of surpassing ugliness!A genius wouldn't be able to sell them!","Spartacus"
"1486",9395947,9398746,"Flog that scoundrel out of camp.","Spartacus"
"1487",9398826,9402147,"This woman and her childare to be conveyed to my house in Rome.","Spartacus"
"1488",9415788,9417827,"- Halt them!- Halt!","Spartacus"
"1489",9422308,9423548,"Antoninus?","Spartacus"
"1490",9440509,9441509,"Tribune!","Spartacus"
"1491",9447789,9450988,"Slaves are to be crucifiedalong the roadside...","Spartacus"
"1492",9451068,9455069,"the whole distance between hereand the gates of Rome.","Spartacus"
"1493",9458069,9460069,"Hold this man till the end.","Spartacus"
"1494",9463309,9465110,"And that man too.","Spartacus"
"1495",9472430,9474431,"- March on.- March on!","Spartacus"
"1496",9526073,9528673,"I've more stripes on my backthan a zebra!","Spartacus"
"1497",9528753,9531472,"Every time I touch my wounds...","Spartacus"
"1498",9532153,9534913,"they sing like larks.","Spartacus"
"1499",9534993,9537033,"But in spite of that,I think I've found something...","Spartacus"
"1500",9537113,9539754,"- I never had before with all my wealth.- What is that?","Spartacus"
"1501",9540914,9543713,"Don't laugh at me,but I believe it to be dignity.","Spartacus"
"1502",9543793,9546273,"In Rome,dignity shortens life...","Spartacus"
"1503",9546353,9548713,"even more surely than disease.","Spartacus"
"1504",9548793,9551154,"The gods must be saving youfor some great enterprise.","Spartacus"
"1505",9551754,9553713,"You think so?","Spartacus"
"1506",9553793,9558034,"Anyone who believes I'll turn informerfor nothing is a fool.","Spartacus"
"1507",9558114,9560594,"I bore the whipwithout complaint.","Spartacus"
"1508",9560674,9564434,"Yes, indeed, that soundslike a bad attack of dignity.","Spartacus"
"1509",9564514,9566795,"I hope, however,this will not deflect you...","Spartacus"
"1510",9566875,9569114,"from the revengeyou were going to take on Crassus.","Spartacus"
"1511",9569194,9571795,"No, on the contrary.It only strengthens my resolve.","Spartacus"
"1512",9571875,9574514,"I'm glad to learn that.","Spartacus"
"1513",9576635,9580075,"This woman Varinia is in his house.All Rome knows about it.","Spartacus"
"1514",9580156,9582156,"Malicious tongues even say...","Spartacus"
"1515",9582236,9585275,"that he's in lovefor the first time in his life.","Spartacus"
"1516",9589036,9591675,"I noticed a strange look in his eyewhen he first saw her.","Spartacus"
"1517",9591755,9593995,"It would take a great woman...","Spartacus"
"1518",9594075,9597075,"to make Crassusfall out of love with himself.","Spartacus"
"1519",9597156,9599156,"I'll be honest with you,Gracchus.","Spartacus"
"1520",9599236,9602277,"She's not as unattractiveas I told you she was.","Spartacus"
"1521",9602356,9606156,"Dignity and honesty in one afternoon!I hardly recognize you.","Spartacus"
"1522",9606916,9609516,"- But she is an impossible woman.- Beautiful?","Spartacus"
"1523",9609596,9611836,"Beautiful? Well, beautiful.","Spartacus"
"1524",9611916,9614477,"The more chains you put on her,the less like a slave she looks.","Spartacus"
"1525",9614557,9616557,"- Proud?- Proud, proud.","Spartacus"
"1526",9616637,9619277,"You'd feel that she would surrenderto the right man...","Spartacus"
"1527",9619356,9621558,"which is irritating.","Spartacus"
"1528",9622317,9626237,"I like Crassus.Let's save him from his agony.","Spartacus"
"1529",9626317,9628317,"Let's steal this woman.","Spartacus"
"1530",9629438,9631757,"Steal the woman? Why?","Spartacus"
"1531",9631837,9634038,"I can no longer hurt Crassusin the senate...","Spartacus"
"1532",9634118,9637677,"but I can hurt him wherehe'll feel it most: in his pride.","Spartacus"
"1533",9637757,9639878,"Attack our enemy from within.","Spartacus"
"1534",9639958,9641759,"The scheme is excellent...","Spartacus"
"1535",9641838,9644799,"but I hope you're not suggestingthat I steal the woman!","Spartacus"
"1536",9644879,9646959,"Yes.","Spartacus"
"1537",9647039,9650039,"Buy some horsesand a cart with a canopy.","Spartacus"
"1538",9650119,9652119,"Bring her here by nightfall.","Spartacus"
"1539",9653998,9657599,"Add courageto your newfound virtues.","Spartacus"
"1540",9659558,9662840,"Would half a million sestercesmake you brave?","Spartacus"
"1541",9665479,9667520,"Half a million?","Spartacus"
"1542",9671280,9676000,"Crassus does seem to dwindlein the mind, but--","Spartacus"
"1543",9676079,9678920,"Let's reduce him still further.A round million!","Spartacus"
"1544",9680079,9682081,"A million.","Spartacus"
"1545",9682161,9684281,"For such a sum,I could bribe Jupiter himself!","Spartacus"
"1546",9685320,9687361,"With a lesser sum, I have.","Spartacus"
"1547",9693441,9695200,"Forgive the intrusion.","Spartacus"
"1548",9695281,9697841,"You know I'm not in the habitof coming into your house uninvited.","Spartacus"
"1549",9697921,9699921,"You've always been welcome here...","Spartacus"
"1550",9700001,9702001,"as a pupil.","Spartacus"
"1551",9705762,9708322,"- You're not alone.- No.","Spartacus"
"1552",9710041,9712842,"This time you've come to teach.","Spartacus"
"1553",9714402,9716402,"You've joined Crassus?","Spartacus"
"1554",9717361,9719602,"- Am I arrested?- No.","Spartacus"
"1555",9719682,9722322,"But I must ask you to come with meto the senate immediately.","Spartacus"
"1556",9724522,9726882,"What I do,I do not for myself...","Spartacus"

"79",521470,524098,"Because his eyes have made love to meall evening.","Ghost Rider"
"80",524273,529210,"That's a lie. He barely glanced at you.I never took my glasses from his face...","Ghost Rider"
"81",529378,531846,"...except for an instantto let him see mine.","Ghost Rider"
"82",532014,534676,"Perhaps that was the instanthe smiled at me.","Ghost Rider"
"83",534850,537614,"He did not smile at you,and he won't meet you here.","Ghost Rider"

"93",570152,572484,"...you'll land in the gutter beforeyou're through.","Ghost Rider"

"108",640790,643520,"- No.- That's very nice.","Ghost Rider"
"109",643693,647527,"I was wondering if you'd ask me to sitdown if I knocked at the door of the box.","Ghost Rider"
"110",647697,648925,"Why not?","Ghost Rider"
"111",649098,652033,"We really seemed fated to meetthis evening, didn't we?","Ghost Rider"
"112",674590,677889,"Fate must've had something to dowith this evening.","Ghost Rider"
"113",678060,680460,"I've hoped for it so long.","Ghost Rider"
"114",681063,682587,"- You don't believe me?- No.","Ghost Rider"
"115",682765,685097,"The first time I saw youwas a year and a half ago.","Ghost Rider"
"116",685267,687667,"You were in an open carriageand dressed in white.","Ghost Rider"
"117",687837,690169,"I saw you go into a shopin the Place de la Bourse.","Ghost Rider"
"118",690339,693740,"Yes, that might've happened. I wentto a dressmaker in Place de la Bourse.","Ghost Rider"
"119",693909,697504,"You were wearing a thin dresswith miles of ruffles...","Ghost Rider"
"120",697680,702344,"...a large straw hat, an embroidered shawl,a single bracelet and heavy, gold chain...","Ghost Rider"
"121",702518,704645,"...and, of course,the camellias at your waist.","Ghost Rider"
"122",704820,706788,"You have a marvelous memory,haven't you?","Ghost Rider"
"123",707523,709457,"The next time was at the Op�ra Comique.","Ghost Rider"
"124",709625,711752,"You were sitting in a boxwith a fur coat on...","Ghost Rider"
"125",711927,714760,"...and Gaston, a chap whom I knowwho knows you...","Ghost Rider"
"126",714930,717455,"...said, ""Marguerite's been ill.""","Ghost Rider"
"127",718501,720435,"And that hurt me.","Ghost Rider"
"128",721036,723869,"- The next time...- Tell me, if all you say is true...","Ghost Rider"
"129",724039,726337,"...why have you neverspoken to me before?","Ghost Rider"
"130",726509,729637,"- In the first place, I didn't know you.- You didn't know me tonight.","Ghost Rider"
"131",729812,734408,"No, but after you smiled at me,I knew you wouldn't mind.","Ghost Rider"
"132",734650,736743,"And now, since you've met me?","Ghost Rider"
"133",736919,739012,"Now I know that I love you...","Ghost Rider"
"134",739188,741918,"...and have loved yousince that first day.","Ghost Rider"
"135",745161,747220,"Marguerite, my dear.","Ghost Rider"
"136",749965,752365,"After what happened,I had to have a brandy.","Ghost Rider"
"137",752535,756096,"- And after that, two brandies.- Yes, and then he made me have another.","Ghost Rider"
"138",756272,758866,"Well, that's only four.","Ghost Rider"
"139",759041,761566,"Suppose you go and have another,Prudence, and then...","Ghost Rider"

"146",777259,779625,"- Baron de Varville?- He, the Baron de Varville?","Ghost Rider"
"147",779795,782127,"No wonder she wanted to get rid of us.","Ghost Rider"
"148",782298,785563,"Well, l... I never saidI was the ""Baron"" anybody.","Ghost Rider"
"149",785734,787224,"There's the Baron de Varville...","Ghost Rider"

"157",811093,812492,"My name is Armand Duval.","Ghost Rider"

"159",814964,816761,"- Armand Duval.- Yes.","Ghost Rider"
"160",818734,822534,"I'm not always sincere.One can't be in this world, you know.","Ghost Rider"
"161",822705,826869,"- But I am not sorry the mistake happened.- Nor am I.","Ghost Rider"
"162",827843,831973,"The baron keeps looking over here.That must worry Olympe.","Ghost Rider"
"163",833382,838251,"Well, as long as you don't wish to sit down,would you go and buy me some sweets?","Ghost Rider"
"164",838420,840718,"You can afford a poundof marrons glac�s...","Ghost Rider"
"165",840890,843415,"...even if you're not the rich baron,can't you?","Ghost Rider"
"166",843926,846895,"I'll not come back with your sweetstoo soon.","Ghost Rider"

"170",871253,873016,"I know her, of course.","Ghost Rider"
"171",873188,875656,"But she's not easy to get along with.Ask anybody.","Ghost Rider"
"172",875824,877189,"What did you say her name was?","Ghost Rider"
"173",877359,881056,"And she has a reputation of being oneof the most extravagant girls in Paris...","Ghost Rider"
"174",881230,883892,"...as well as one of the most insincere.","Ghost Rider"
"175",884066,887502,"- I like sincerity, don't you?- It's an admirable quality.","Ghost Rider"
"176",887670,889934,"Well, I insist on it.","Ghost Rider"

"183",909291,912692,"A friend of mine is giving a small partytonight, if you'd care to come.","Ghost Rider"
"184",912861,916957,"I detest parties. Thank youfor a very charming entr'acte, my dear.","Ghost Rider"
"185",918267,919529,"Will I see you again?","Ghost Rider"

"192",955904,958668,"I had to go to two shopsbefore I found your marrons glac�s.","Ghost Rider"
"193",958841,960638,"It doesn't matter. I'm in no hurry.","Ghost Rider"
"194",960809,963937,"But since nothing but marrons glac�swould do, these are very fresh.","Ghost Rider"
"195",964113,966547,"- Will monsieur try one?- Thank you.","Ghost Rider"
"196",972554,974078,"Thank you, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"

"223",1083165,1085429,"He's quite old. He's older than Nanine.","Ghost Rider"
"224",1085601,1091005,"But, well, he needs someone to take careof him, and I know Olympe won't.","Ghost Rider"
"225",1092341,1095208,"So much heart and so little sense.","Ghost Rider"

"254",1186535,1189197,"Tell the old coachmanwe'll take him with the horses.","Ghost Rider"
"255",1189371,1193205,"- You really have a heart, Marguerite.- Yes. It's going to cost her a lot.","Ghost Rider"
"256",1193375,1196037,"- I hope mine never gets that soft.- Don't worry, it won't.","Ghost Rider"
"257",1196211,1200045,"It's a great mistake for any womanto have a heart bigger than her purse.","Ghost Rider"
"258",1200215,1202581,"Prudence, did you invite themto my party tomorrow?","Ghost Rider"
"259",1202751,1204480,"I thought the baron disliked parties.","Ghost Rider"
"260",1204653,1206883,"He won't be there.He'd be bored with my friends.","Ghost Rider"
"261",1207055,1210456,"- Have you quarreled?- Not yet, but don't give up hope, Olympe.","Ghost Rider"

"267",1230178,1233443,"- You seem to think that's very fine of him.- But of course I do.","Ghost Rider"
"268",1233615,1236448,"After all, I have no dowry,and he's a gentleman and educated.","Ghost Rider"
"269",1236618,1239587,"Even so, why should the mentionof marriage go to your head?","Ghost Rider"
"270",1239755,1243589,"But, Marguerite, it's ideal to love,and to marry the one you love.","Ghost Rider"
"271",1243759,1247092,"I have no faith in ideals.Amuse yourself if you wish.","Ghost Rider"

"288",1310192,1313787,"- Always with you?- Always with me, like an old friend...","Ghost Rider"
"289",1313962,1316624,"...to remind me that I'm notthe Baron de Varville.","Ghost Rider"
"290",1318166,1322694,"- That's not a very romantic reason.- No, I kept it as a warning against romance.","Ghost Rider"
"291",1322871,1326363,"How sensible.Has it made you very cynical?","Ghost Rider"
"292",1326541,1330375,"- Yes, very.- Is that why you've never called on me?","Ghost Rider"
"293",1330712,1334170,"- Perhaps.- I'm sorry. One needs friends.","Ghost Rider"
"294",1334349,1336442,"Well, I've been looking for you.","Ghost Rider"
"295",1336618,1339610,"Monsieur, you can see for yourself,she's quite well again.","Ghost Rider"

"297",1341823,1344291,"Well, or would beif she took proper care of herself.","Ghost Rider"
"298",1344459,1346791,"Why would my health interestMonsieur Duval?","Ghost Rider"
"299",1346962,1349055,"Because he came every daywhen you were ill...","Ghost Rider"
"300",1349231,1351426,"...to ask how you wereand to leave flowers.","Ghost Rider"
"301",1354036,1355264,"He's the one?","Ghost Rider"
"302",1355437,1358463,"Tell her yourself.He just said ""a friend,"" so I thought...","Ghost Rider"
"303",1358640,1363043,"- All right, Nanine. Wait for me downstairs.- Yes, madame. Monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"304",1367416,1372444,"- You might have asked to have seen me.- Well, I knew there were so many others.","Ghost Rider"

"306",1374289,1378020,"None during all those weeksthe doctors thought I might die.","Ghost Rider"
"307",1378193,1379820,"Not even the Baron de Varville?","Ghost Rider"
"308",1379995,1383055,"Baron de Varville choseto be in England at the time.","Ghost Rider"
"309",1383231,1387327,"No, you were the only onethat took the trouble to ring my bell.","Ghost Rider"

"320",1417332,1420597,"Yes, it is, but it's rather sad.She dies in the end.","Ghost Rider"
"321",1420769,1424330,"Well, then I'll keep it, but I won't read it.I don't like sad thoughts.","Ghost Rider"
"322",1424506,1426997,"However, we all die.","Ghost Rider"
"323",1427175,1431578,"So perhaps this will be sold againsomeday at an auction after my death.","Ghost Rider"

"396",1821202,1824638,"Too much winehas made you sentimental.","Ghost Rider"
"397",1828243,1832646,"It wasn't wine that made me come everyday for months to find out how you were.","Ghost Rider"

"419",1920117,1923211,"That's too much. And not enough.","Ghost Rider"
"420",1925423,1928392,"Don't you believe in love, Marguerite?","Ghost Rider"
"421",1930795,1933389,"I don't think I know what it is.","Ghost Rider"
"422",1933564,1936761,"- Oh, thank you.- For what?","Ghost Rider"

"562",2577407,2581366,"No, I think he means it.And perhaps it's better.","Ghost Rider"
"563",2582279,2584509,"But he had no right to writesuch things to me.","Ghost Rider"
"564",2584681,2587514,"Of course he didn't. Now, come along.Let's go to the theater.","Ghost Rider"
"565",2587684,2591211,"But first you'll stop at his placeand find out if he's really going away.","Ghost Rider"
"566",2598095,2600859,"Why on earth does anyonelive four flights up?","Ghost Rider"
"567",2601031,2603761,"- You've come with a message.- Yes, I've got to sit down...","Ghost Rider"

"580",2643940,2646966,"No, I think I'd better stay.","Ghost Rider"
"581",2647444,2649605,"I think you'd better not.","Ghost Rider"
"582",2653316,2656149,"- Oh, don't!- Haven't got much time if you want it back.","Ghost Rider"
"583",2656319,2659311,"Oh, don't. Don't, Marguerite.","Ghost Rider"
"584",2663060,2665654,"Oh, what a girl. What a tease!","Ghost Rider"
"585",2674004,2676598,"You wrote me an unkind letter.","Ghost Rider"
"586",2678308,2681175,"What did you expect?I saw the baron's carriage.","Ghost Rider"
"587",2681344,2683972,"- You were jealous.- Of course.","Ghost Rider"
"588",2685949,2688315,"Well, then you do right in going away.","Ghost Rider"
"589",2688985,2692011,"Well, what does it matterwhether I go or stay?","Ghost Rider"
"590",2692956,2696448,"I played the fool again, and you'veprobably been laughing at me ever since.","Ghost Rider"
"591",2696626,2698890,"I didn't laugh at all.","Ghost Rider"
"592",2699062,2703897,"I was angry because you dared writesuch things to me, but I didn't laugh.","Ghost Rider"
"593",2706470,2709303,"You should have knownit was because I loved you.","Ghost Rider"
"594",2713176,2718773,"You know, once I had a little dog,and he always looked sad when I was sad...","Ghost Rider"
"595",2718949,2721281,"...and I loved him so.","Ghost Rider"
"596",2721451,2726548,"And when your tears fell on my hand,I loved you too all at once.","Ghost Rider"
"597",2728325,2731852,"There are things that you wouldn'tunderstand, so that's why...","Ghost Rider"

"659",2946009,2949672,"- I want too much.- So do I.","Ghost Rider"
"660",2949846,2955216,"How can one change one's entire life andbuild a new one on one moment of love?","Ghost Rider"
"661",2955385,2958445,"And yet that's what you make mewant to close my eyes and do.","Ghost Rider"
"662",2958621,2962455,"Then close your eyes and say yes.I command it.","Ghost Rider"

"674",3009005,3011235,"I'm going to the country just the same.","Ghost Rider"
"675",3011408,3015504,"And what do you think will happen whenthe rest of your creditors hear about it...","Ghost Rider"

"682",3036433,3040096,"- Now that I'm going to leave him?- You don't have to tell him everything.","Ghost Rider"
"683",3040270,3044070,"She's right, madame. If you've really setyour heart on going to the country...","Ghost Rider"
"684",3044240,3046834,"...you've got to get some moneyfrom someone, somehow.","Ghost Rider"
"685",3047010,3050036,"What is the matter with youanyway, Marguerite?","Ghost Rider"
"686",3050213,3054309,"Have you suddenly becomea sentimental schoolgirl?","Ghost Rider"

"698",3098261,3101025,"- Do you think me very businesslike?- Very.","Ghost Rider"
"699",3101464,3103193,"But why?","Ghost Rider"

"701",3108104,3110265,"Will you lend me the money?","Ghost Rider"
"702",3111708,3113175,"No.","Ghost Rider"

"706",3127657,3130649,"Because then you might haveno further use for me.","Ghost Rider"
"707",3134297,3137630,"Well, I don't think you're very generous.","Ghost Rider"
"708",3138468,3141733,"Prudence tells me you plan to goto the country this summer.","Ghost Rider"
"709",3141938,3143872,"Prudence is a chatterbox.","Ghost Rider"
"710",3144607,3147770,"Living quietly two or three monthsin the country, alone...","Ghost Rider"
"711",3147944,3151243,"...obeying your doctor's orders,sounds an admirable idea.","Ghost Rider"
"712",3151414,3153507,"But extremely unlike you.","Ghost Rider"
"713",3153683,3157016,"- What can you do about it?- I can deliberately put you out of my mind.","Ghost Rider"
"714",3157186,3158414,"Why should you?","Ghost Rider"
"715",3158588,3160886,"It's become a questionof either avoiding you...","Ghost Rider"
"716",3161057,3163321,"...or taking youout of this life altogether.","Ghost Rider"
"717",3163493,3167190,"What will you do with me? Lock me in thatgloomy chateau you've got somewhere?","Ghost Rider"
"718",3167363,3169024,"I might.","Ghost Rider"

"721",3178741,3181039,"But my consolation is...","Ghost Rider"
"722",3181277,3183871,"...I am well rid of such a fool.","Ghost Rider"
"723",3185014,3188575,"Here's the 40,000 francs you need.But this is my last act of consideration.","Ghost Rider"
"724",3188751,3191276,"If ever we meet again,it will be on a different basis.","Ghost Rider"
"725",3191454,3194252,"I never make the same mistake twice.","Ghost Rider"

"734",3297026,3300689,"- Madame, are you ill?- No, why should I be ill?","Ghost Rider"
"735",3300863,3303525,"Because you're awake at this early hourin the morning.","Ghost Rider"
"736",3303700,3306999,"I'm not ill. I'm awakeand I want to get up, Nanine.","Ghost Rider"

"738",3310573,3312837,"We are indeed.","Ghost Rider"
"739",3313009,3317810,"If I'm not mistaken, you'll soon wish youwere in your comfortable house in Paris.","Ghost Rider"
"740",3317980,3321609,"Monsieur Duval alone will see to that.This place is nothing but a hut.","Ghost Rider"
"741",3321784,3325550,"There are no gaslights, and you haveto fetch water from a reservoir...","Ghost Rider"
"742",3325722,3327587,"...and heat it on a stove.","Ghost Rider"
"743",3327757,3330191,"You can't sleep at nighton account of the birds...","Ghost Rider"
"744",3330359,3334693,"...and before sunup, there was a big noiselike more birds, only worse.","Ghost Rider"
"745",3334864,3336729,"Chickens, I suppose.","Ghost Rider"
"746",3336899,3342337,"And as for that linen on the beds,it's so coarse, I scratched all night.","Ghost Rider"
"747",3342505,3345941,"And I never slept betterin my life, Nanine.","Ghost Rider"
"748",3346109,3348805,"How far is it to the innwhere Monsieur Duval is staying?","Ghost Rider"
"749",3348978,3351242,"How should I know, madame?","Ghost Rider"
"750",3351414,3353712,"Now, come, Nanine.","Ghost Rider"
"751",3355184,3358085,"He said he'd be over early this morning.","Ghost Rider"

"753",3364894,3369593,"What delicious air.What a heavenly room.","Ghost Rider"
"754",3369966,3372730,"Good heavens, you scared me!Can't you knock properly?","Ghost Rider"
"755",3372902,3374460,"Not when I've got me hands full.","Ghost Rider"
"756",3374637,3377105,"A wooden shoe makes a better noisethan your knuckles.","Ghost Rider"

"762",3393623,3395784,"- What kind of cows do you keep?- Jersey.","Ghost Rider"
"763",3395958,3399223,"I thought so, they give the best milk.What do you feed them?","Ghost Rider"
"764",3399395,3402091,"Plenty of red clover, hay and bran mash.","Ghost Rider"
"765",3402265,3404893,"That's silly. The cows getall the grass they need now.","Ghost Rider"
"766",3405067,3407228,"The thing is not to let themrun their feet off.","Ghost Rider"
"767",3407403,3410395,"- Lf they want to, you've got to let them run.- Oh, no, you don't.","Ghost Rider"
"768",3410573,3414839,"I'll take them out walking myself someday,and I'll show you how to manage them.","Ghost Rider"

"775",3453115,3455709,"Oh, what a fine sight in this light.","Ghost Rider"
"776",3455885,3458820,"- It looks like a castle of a king.- Yes.","Ghost Rider"
"777",3459589,3461921,"When I was a little girl,I always wanted to see...","Ghost Rider"
"778",3462091,3464525,"...what a great chateauwould look like inside.","Ghost Rider"
"779",3466062,3468292,"You are tired.","Ghost Rider"
"780",3468464,3471956,"I'm not used to long country walks yet.","Ghost Rider"

"815",3631894,3634488,"He was no better than sheto share her love with others.","Ghost Rider"

"854",3856619,3858450,"I won't tell you yet.","Ghost Rider"
"855",3858621,3861522,"Of course, she thinks you're a foolfor wasting yourself on me.","Ghost Rider"
"856",3861690,3863157,"Perhaps you are.","Ghost Rider"
"857",3863325,3866192,"What did Gaston mean by""an appointment you'd lost""?","Ghost Rider"
"858",3866362,3869126,"Nothing. Some chap was givena post by the foreign office...","Ghost Rider"
"859",3869298,3871232,"...that Gaston seemed to think I wanted.","Ghost Rider"
"860",3871400,3873664,"- Are you sure you didn't?- Yes, quite sure.","Ghost Rider"
"861",3873836,3876100,"It meant my leaving France.","Ghost Rider"
"862",3876605,3879597,"Shall we...? Shall we go inside?","Ghost Rider"
"863",3880509,3882943,"We might go to the top of the hill.","Ghost Rider"
"864",3883112,3886548,"- Look at the baron's chateau?- No.","Ghost Rider"
"865",3886715,3889582,"Are you going to spoil a day like thisby being jealous?","Ghost Rider"

"875",3923252,3926744,"- Oh, why?- So I can make plans for our future.","Ghost Rider"
"876",3926922,3930722,"And you won't have to live in two roomsfive flights up like Nichette either.","Ghost Rider"
"877",3930893,3933919,"You'll have a little housein the garden, all your own.","Ghost Rider"
"878",3934096,3937827,"I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow to seethe lawyer who made my grandfather's will.","Ghost Rider"

"883",3949678,3952772,"Everything in the world. Everything.","Ghost Rider"

"888",3972468,3975301,"- What?- I married you today.","Ghost Rider"
"889",3975471,3978167,"Every word the priest saidwas meant for us...","Ghost Rider"

"891",3982044,3984979,"- And I to you.- Then...","Ghost Rider"
"892",3985147,3989049,"No, no. That isn't fitting.Let me love you. Let me live for you.","Ghost Rider"
"893",3989218,3992016,"Don't let me ask any morefrom heaven than that.","Ghost Rider"
"894",3992187,3994815,"God might get angry.","Ghost Rider"
"895",4002798,4006757,"Oh, why does anybody wantto keep bees, anyhow? They're so fickle.","Ghost Rider"
"896",4006935,4008698,"If they want to fly away, let them.","Ghost Rider"
"897",4008871,4011271,"They'll fly away when theyget the swarming fever...","Ghost Rider"
"898",4011440,4014000,"...unless we make so much noisethey settle down again.","Ghost Rider"
"899",4014176,4016474,"They're going to settle in that tree.Look.","Ghost Rider"
"900",4020682,4024243,"Every time I eat a mouthful of honey,I'll think what loons we look doing this.","Ghost Rider"
"901",4024420,4026581,"Who knows the bee song?All together now.","Ghost Rider"
"902",4052080,4056244,"Please don't think us mad, monsieur.Did you want to see someone?","Ghost Rider"
"903",4056418,4058716,"- Mademoiselle Gautier?- Yes.","Ghost Rider"
"904",4058887,4061947,"I was told at the innthat I'd find my son here.","Ghost Rider"
"905",4062124,4064820,"- Your son?- Armand Duval.","Ghost Rider"
"906",4069598,4074695,"Yes, Armand Duval is very often here,but he's in Paris today.","Ghost Rider"
"907",4075904,4078338,"- Do you wish to come in?- Thank you.","Ghost Rider"
"908",4085581,4088243,"I'm sorry your son isn't here, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"909",4088417,4090112,"Well, it's just as well.","Ghost Rider"
"910",4090285,4094779,"I didn't look forward to seeing himwith any pleasure, under the circumstances.","Ghost Rider"
"911",4094957,4099690,"As a matter of fact, I'm glad to be ableto talk to you directly and frankly.","Ghost Rider"
"912",4099862,4102660,"You see, I knowwhat's been going on here.","Ghost Rider"
"913",4102831,4105891,"You don't think me worthy of your son.You're right, I'm not.","Ghost Rider"
"914",4106068,4109128,"No. No woman is worthyof a man's love...","Ghost Rider"
"915",4109304,4114037,"...who's willing to let him ruin himselffor her, as you're doing.","Ghost Rider"
"916",4114209,4117110,"I don't know what you've heard,but it isn't true.","Ghost Rider"
"917",4117279,4118940,"Armand has told me himself...","Ghost Rider"
"918",4119114,4123448,"...that he wants to take his modest fortuneout of my hands at once.","Ghost Rider"
"919",4123619,4125951,"The reason is obvious, isn't it?","Ghost Rider"
"920",4126121,4129386,"Can you deny he wants the moneyfor you?","Ghost Rider"
"921",4130559,4134051,"Whatever the reason, I hopeyou won't let him have it, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"922",4136565,4138863,"I wish I could believe you were sincere.","Ghost Rider"
"923",4140002,4143165,"A few years ago,I lived on bread and soup.","Ghost Rider"
"924",4143338,4146068,"I can manage very well withouttaking anything from Armand.","Ghost Rider"
"925",4146241,4152043,"I still say what I came here to say.This thing must end at once.","Ghost Rider"
"926",4152214,4155012,"You might as wellsave your breath, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"927",4157619,4161020,"How long have youknown Armand, madame?","Ghost Rider"
"928",4161189,4163521,"Three months and 12 days, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"929",4163692,4168891,"Three months and 12 days. And how longdo you expect this thing to last?","Ghost Rider"
"930",4169798,4171857,"You have never known loveto last, monsieur?","Ghost Rider"
"931",4172034,4175003,"Never, when it wasunsanctified by marriage...","Ghost Rider"
"932",4175170,4178196,"...unblessed by children or social ties.","Ghost Rider"
"933",4178373,4181968,"I shall love Armand always, and Ibelieve he shall love me always too.","Ghost Rider"
"934",4182144,4183736,"- Always, eh?- Always.","Ghost Rider"
"935",4183912,4188008,"Hasn't your own experience taught youthe human heart can't be trusted?","Ghost Rider"
"936",4188183,4191744,"I think I know my own heartbetter than you can, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"937",4191920,4193979,"And I can trust it not to change.","Ghost Rider"
"938",4194156,4199025,"No woman, unprotected as you are, canafford to give the best years of her life...","Ghost Rider"
"939",4199194,4202527,"...to a man who, when he leaves her,will leave her with nothing...","Ghost Rider"
"940",4202698,4206065,"...and who is certain to leave herin the end.","Ghost Rider"
"941",4206735,4210535,"I don't suppose you can understandhow any woman...","Ghost Rider"
"942",4210706,4216440,"...unprotected, as you say I am,can be lifted above self-interest...","Ghost Rider"
"943",4216612,4220139,"...by a sentiment so delicate and purethat she feels only humiliation...","Ghost Rider"
"944",4220315,4221839,"...when you speak of such things.","Ghost Rider"
"945",4223251,4227312,"I realize now that youdo love him unselfishly.","Ghost Rider"
"946",4227489,4230117,"But even so, I say it can't go on.","Ghost Rider"
"947",4230292,4232852,"- But it will go on!- Armand is a young man...","Ghost Rider"
"948",4233028,4235861,"...with his way to make,with a career waiting for him.","Ghost Rider"
"949",4236031,4239626,"And in his case, he can't servehis best interests by being tied...","Ghost Rider"
"950",4239801,4244534,"...to a woman he can't presentto his family or his friends.","Ghost Rider"
"951",4245107,4248076,"- Armand is no different than other men.- Oh, come, madame.","Ghost Rider"
"952",4248243,4251076,"Be honest.Haven't you found him different?","Ghost Rider"
"953",4251246,4254875,"Haven't you found himmore sensitive, more loyal?","Ghost Rider"
"954",4255050,4258542,"Or am I prejudicedbecause I'm his father?","Ghost Rider"
"955",4258987,4262252,"No. No, no. Armand is different.","Ghost Rider"
"956",4262424,4268192,"And so you see, as long as Armand lovesyou, he'll not enter rooms that you can't.","Ghost Rider"
"957",4268363,4271992,"But a man can go back.He can always go back.","Ghost Rider"
"958",4272901,4274528,"Monsieur...","Ghost Rider"
"959",4274703,4278400,"...suppose I told you I have a feelingI shan't live very long?","Ghost Rider"
"960",4278573,4283237,"Well, then I'd scold you for being fancifuland a little foolish.","Ghost Rider"
"961",4283578,4287105,"What you probably feelis the melancholy of happiness...","Ghost Rider"
"962",4287282,4290183,"...that mood that comes overall of us when we realize...","Ghost Rider"
"963",4290352,4294482,"...that even love can't remainat flood tide forever.","Ghost Rider"
"964",4294656,4298820,"- Without Armand, I'm doomed.- With him, you're both doomed.","Ghost Rider"
"965",4298994,4302623,"Without a profession of any sort,what can he do?","Ghost Rider"
"966",4302798,4305631,"Unless he sinks so lowhe's willing to let some other man...","Ghost Rider"
"967",4305801,4307735,"...foot the bills for his life with you.","Ghost Rider"
"968",4307903,4309928,"You don't know Armand.You wouldn't say that.","Ghost Rider"
"969",4310105,4314041,"No one knows the man he might becomeif he loses his self-respect.","Ghost Rider"
"970",4314209,4318305,"But I think that's too higha price to pay, even for love.","Ghost Rider"
"971",4318480,4323110,"I want Armand to enjoy life,not to be sacrificed to it.","Ghost Rider"
"972",4323285,4328120,"You see, my son is as dear to meas he possibly can be to you.","Ghost Rider"
"973",4328657,4331592,"Yes, but you have otherswho are dear to you.","Ghost Rider"
"974",4331760,4334729,"I have only Armand.","Ghost Rider"
"975",4335564,4338089,"You don't know how I've changed.","Ghost Rider"
"976",4338266,4343260,"And he taught me that love is notalways selfish, nor goodness dull...","Ghost Rider"
"977",4343438,4348603,"...nor men faithless. No, no. You can'texpect me to give up such love as his.","Ghost Rider"
"978",4348777,4350472,"Think what's best for him.","Ghost Rider"
"979",4350779,4354237,"Think what you'd want for himif he were your own son.","Ghost Rider"
"980",4354816,4358980,"Then think how you're killinghis right to a normal life.","Ghost Rider"
"981",4359154,4363682,"Try to realize that everythingyou're ashamed of in your own past...","Ghost Rider"
"982",4363859,4366794,"...would only taint his future.","Ghost Rider"
"983",4366962,4370591,"You tell me that you love him.I believe you.","Ghost Rider"
"984",4370766,4375226,"That's why I'm able to stand here,a man who's getting old...","Ghost Rider"
"985",4375403,4378167,"...and ask this great sacrifice of you...","Ghost Rider"
"986",4378340,4382504,"...as humbly as I'd aska great favor of a queen.","Ghost Rider"
"987",4382677,4388582,"I can give you nothing in return,except my thanks and my respect.","Ghost Rider"
"988",4388750,4391446,"Please give him up.","Ghost Rider"
"989",4394089,4399322,"- What shall I do?- Talk to him. Tell him he must leave you.","Ghost Rider"
"990",4399494,4402827,"- I have talked.- Leave him.","Ghost Rider"
"991",4403131,4406464,"- He'd follow me.- Tell him you don't love him.","Ghost Rider"
"992",4406635,4408626,"He wouldn't believe me.","Ghost Rider"
"993",4413775,4415538,"No.","Ghost Rider"
"994",4415710,4418508,"I know only one way.","Ghost Rider"
"995",4419181,4422048,"But I shan't tell you what it is.","Ghost Rider"
"996",4423718,4426312,"I knew I was too happy.","Ghost Rider"
"997",4426488,4428649,"What are you going to do?","Ghost Rider"
"998",4429858,4432452,"Don't let yourself think of it.","Ghost Rider"
"999",4432794,4435160,"I'll send him back to you tonight.","Ghost Rider"
"1000",4435330,4438493,"How can I ever repay youfor all you're doing for me?","Ghost Rider"
"1001",4442270,4444795,"Make no mistake, monsieur.","Ghost Rider"
"1002",4444973,4448739,"Whatever I do, it's nothing for you.","Ghost Rider"
"1003",4448910,4452471,"- It's all for Armand.- I thank you just the same.","Ghost Rider"
"1004",4452647,4458381,"And I shall never forgetwhat I and my family owe you.","Ghost Rider"
"1005",4472968,4477268,"Goodbye, monsieur.Don't reproach yourself.","Ghost Rider"
"1006",4477439,4480840,"You've done only what Armand's fathershould have done.","Ghost Rider"
"1007",4481009,4484536,"Only, don't let him know it.He might hate you.","Ghost Rider"
"1008",4484713,4486977,"And I don't want that to happen...","Ghost Rider"
"1009",4487148,4492279,"...because he shall need all the courageand comfort you can give him...","Ghost Rider"
"1010",4492454,4495582,"...for a long time, I think.","Ghost Rider"
"1011",4498193,4501788,"God bless you, Marguerite Gautier.","Ghost Rider"
"1012",4525820,4527845,"Did the gentleman go?","Ghost Rider"
"1013",4529024,4531322,"But, madame, what's the matter?","Ghost Rider"
"1014",4533795,4539734,"I want you to take this letterand give it to Baron de Varville yourself.","Ghost Rider"
"1015",4539901,4543997,"But I thought you were so happyat last with Monsieur Duval.","Ghost Rider"
"1016",4544172,4546072,"I was.","Ghost Rider"
"1017",4546241,4547538,"I don't know what's in it...","Ghost Rider"
"1018",4547709,4551167,"...but I know the very thoughtof this one makes you shudder.","Ghost Rider"
"1019",4551346,4554144,"Are you sure you want me to take it?","Ghost Rider"
"1020",4554316,4559447,"Yes, yes. Go now, Nanine.And pray for me.","Ghost Rider"
"1021",4559621,4563557,"Pray for me that I'll have the strengthto go through with what I have to do.","Ghost Rider"
"1022",4563725,4569686,"Oh, your hands are like ice, child.Tell Nanine what you're going to do.","Ghost Rider"
"1023",4570865,4574562,"Make my love hate me.Make him hate me.","Ghost Rider"
"1024",4574736,4577170,"Oh, God help me.","Ghost Rider"
"1025",4601796,4604356,"Hello. I'm back.","Ghost Rider"
"1026",4605000,4607366,"Oh, I didn't hear you drive up.","Ghost Rider"
"1027",4622684,4625482,"Why are you all dressed up?Not going to a ball, are you?","Ghost Rider"
"1028",4625653,4630386,"No. I wish I were. You don't knowof any balls I might be asked to, do you?","Ghost Rider"
"1029",4630558,4633857,"- Lf you're serious, I brought an invitation.- Really?","Ghost Rider"
"1030",4634029,4637760,"From Olympe. There's a new gambling clubopening. She suggests we go together.","Ghost Rider"
"1031",4637932,4639194,"Where did you see Olympe?","Ghost Rider"
"1032",4639367,4642825,"She dropped in the shop while I wastalking to Prudence about your affairs.","Ghost Rider"
"1033",4643004,4645404,"I didn't ask you to discuss my affairswith Prudence.","Ghost Rider"
"1034",4645573,4648064,"And I did ask her notto talk to you about them.","Ghost Rider"
"1035",4648243,4651610,"Marguerite, you're angry.","Ghost Rider"
"1036",4652147,4654172,"Do you realize thatwe're almost quarreling?","Ghost Rider"
"1037",4654349,4658649,"Well, everybody quarrels.It keeps people from getting bored.","Ghost Rider"
"1038",4659554,4661647,"Something happened today.","Ghost Rider"
"1039",4662690,4665022,"What was it? I want the truth.","Ghost Rider"
"1040",4665527,4669190,"Well, this morning,the bees left the hive...","Ghost Rider"
"1041",4669364,4671025,"...and we had to bring them back.","Ghost Rider"
"1042",4671199,4673599,"This afternoon, I washed my hair.","Ghost Rider"
"1043",4673768,4676703,"Those are the two exciting eventsof my day.","Ghost Rider"
"1044",4677005,4679872,"The first time I leave you,you change completely.","Ghost Rider"
"1045",4680041,4682066,"I come back to you happy,with good news.","Ghost Rider"
"1046",4682243,4685735,"What do you call good news?Have you been left a large fortune?","Ghost Rider"

"1214",5495923,5498790,"Thank God. Oh, thank God.","Ghost Rider"
"1215",5498959,5500187,"But the baron is wounded.","Ghost Rider"
"1216",5500361,5504263,"That means Armand must leave the countryto avoid arrest. He's already on his way.","Ghost Rider"
"1217",5504431,5508697,"- My letter?- I'm sorry. He sent it back.","Ghost Rider"
"1218",5508869,5510803,"He wouldn't open it.","Ghost Rider"

"1226",5562056,5566390,"...and have to stay away for years insteadof months. Have you seen Marguerite?","Ghost Rider"
"1227",5566894,5570591,"- Oh, I'm sorry, I meant...- Well.","Ghost Rider"
"1228",5570764,5573164,"How does Paris look to the traveler?","Ghost Rider"
"1229",5573968,5576163,"The same as it looked six months ago.","Ghost Rider"
"1230",5576337,5579135,"The same girls singing the same songon the same stage.","Ghost Rider"

"1233",5585312,5587746,"Only, Marguerite isn't here.","Ghost Rider"

"1238",5601261,5603627,"- Aren't you?- No, not particularly.","Ghost Rider"
"1239",5603797,5606265,"After all, why should he be?It's nothing new.","Ghost Rider"
"1240",5606433,5609766,"Marguerite is always illor pretending to be.","Ghost Rider"
"1241",5609937,5611928,"You really have a nasty tongue,haven't you?","Ghost Rider"
"1242",5612106,5615234,"Why, if you mean to insinuatethat I haven't been a good friend...","Ghost Rider"
"1243",5615409,5619470,"...to Marguerite Gautier, ask Prudencewhat I've done for her. Just ask her.","Ghost Rider"

"1248",5633961,5637021,"Shut up, Olympe. I know moreabout that than you do.","Ghost Rider"
"1249",5637197,5641657,"Marguerite won't see the baron,or any other man who might help her...","Ghost Rider"
"1250",5641835,5645134,"...in spite of all my motherly advice.- Well, that's what you say.","Ghost Rider"
"1251",5645305,5649264,"Only, this... Last week, I bought this.Look.","Ghost Rider"

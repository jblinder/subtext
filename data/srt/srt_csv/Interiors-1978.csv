"72",407840,410877,"Yeah. It's very beautiful.We'll work something out.","Interiors"
"73",411000,415551,"No, l was just carried away by it.I don't know why.","Interiors"
"74",415680,419958,"Guess it's because it's so unique.But it is an extravagance.","Interiors"
"75",420080,423868,"I'll just look for something alongthe same lines at a better price.","Interiors"
"76",424000,426594,"But this really belongs in the bedroom","Interiors"
"77",426720,430156,"because it's too insignificanta piece for in here.","Interiors"

"79",433920,437390,"- (Michael) l'll put it back.- No. I want to try it in a different spot.","Interiors"
"80",437520,440398,"I can fix something for you,","Interiors"
"81",440520,442636,"something more inexpensive.","Interiors"
"82",443120,446829,"I've seen some nice pewters.um, maybe gunmetal.","Interiors"
"83",446960,450157,"And l can make the shadein a smoother fabric, if you prefer.","Interiors"

"88",468120,470350,"So how do you feel?","Interiors"
"89",470480,473392,"I'm fine. I'm just a little tired, that's all.","Interiors"

"92",486360,490751,"Yeah, l know. I can't get over howyou sort of jump right in and do it.","Interiors"
"93",491320,494676,"Well, l like it. I like to be busy.","Interiors"
"94",496800,501999,"And l think l can say that my comeback isover the shaky period. Wouldn't you say?","Interiors"
"95",502120,505954,"I think so. I think your work is better,in fact, than it's ever been.","Interiors"
"96",506080,508310,"- Do you?- Yeah.","Interiors"
"97",508440,512877,"Well, l have to admit that l have receivedsome rather special compliments lately.","Interiors"

"99",515600,519991,"Yes. Well, my spirits are high.I'm feeling good about myself.","Interiors"
"100",521160,524994,"Not to say that l don't runinto an occasional setback,","Interiors"
"101",525120,528749,"but l haven't really feltso confident in a long time.","Interiors"
"102",528880,531235,"You look better than you have in ages.","Interiors"
"103",531360,534477,"Oh. Have you talked to Dad lately?","Interiors"
"104",534600,536591,"No. He's still in Greece.","Interiors"
"105",536720,540315,"When he comes back, l hope you'llcorroborate the state of my wellbeing.","Interiors"
"106",540440,542237,"Of course.","Interiors"
"107",543040,546476,"I've pulled myself together in a waythat he never thought possible.","Interiors"
"108",546600,550639,"- I mean, you're really impressive.- Oh...","Interiors"
"109",550760,554992,"Well, maybe a reconciliationcould finally be discussed.","Interiors"
"110",555120,556838,"Think so?","Interiors"
"111",556960,560032,"Well, it hasn't been that much time.","Interiors"
"112",560760,563194,"I really don't... I don't know.","Interiors"
"113",568720,572679,"- Why are you always so negative?- I don't think that was negative.","Interiors"
"114",572800,576634,"Oh, you're always reluctant toencourage me. I don't know why.","Interiors"
"115",577200,581398,"Mother, l know that you're optimistic, butit's important for you to be realistic, too.","Interiors"
"116",581520,584159,"- Is there something you're not saying?- No.","Interiors"
"117",584280,586953,"Dr Lobel doesn't think it's unrealistic","Interiors"
"118",587080,590834,"to hope that your father and lmight reconcile. It's just a goal.","Interiors"
"119",590960,594236,"Fine. I didn't say anythingto get in the way of that.","Interiors"
"120",596600,599068,"You always make it soundas though it's impossible.","Interiors"
"121",599200,603796,"- I didn't say it was impossible.- Yes, you did. You imply that a lot.","Interiors"
"122",605440,608034,"Renata thinks it's going to happen.","Interiors"
"123",608160,611038,"- I'm sure she didn't say that.- She did. She implied that.","Interiors"
"124",611160,614914,"- Maybe you read into it.- No. She just looks on the bright side.","Interiors"
"125",615040,619238,"Oh, great. That's wonderful. I just don'tthink you should delude yourself either.","Interiors"
"126",619360,622033,"So there's no chance your fatherwill want to live with me?","Interiors"
"127",622160,624958,"- I didn't say that.- Renata thinks there's a good chance.","Interiors"
"128",625080,627878,"- Just wait and see.- You just refuse to encourage me.","Interiors"
"129",628000,631436,"- Why don't you discuss it with Renata?- I will, thank you. I will.","Interiors"
"130",663480,666040,"Mother paced all the time.","Interiors"
"131",666160,667593,"She...","Interiors"
"132",675000,676433,"um...","Interiors"
"133",677920,679876,"She was an insomniac.","Interiors"
"134",680000,683913,"You could, um... always hear her upstairs","Interiors"
"135",686160,688515,"pacing in the middle of the night.","Interiors"
"136",688640,693077,"But that was more when she...got back from the hospital.","Interiors"
"137",699320,701072,"I, uh...","Interiors"
"138",701880,703632,"I saw her...","Interiors"
"139",705200,708875,"the first day that theybrought her back. um...","Interiors"
"140",709000,711434,"She'd had all this...","Interiors"
"141",712280,716432,"electric shock therapyand... her hair looked grey.","Interiors"
"142",716560,720553,"And l couldn't believe it.It was... It was like...","Interiors"
"143",722360,724715,"she was a stranger.","Interiors"
"144",726840,729752,"After that, she was always sort of, um...","Interiors"
"145",730520,734195,"coming in and... going out.","Interiors"
"146",734320,736276,"I guess you...","Interiors"
"147",737240,739196,"you never knew.","Interiors"
"148",741840,746152,"Before her breakdown, she was verysuccessful. She was very demanding.","Interiors"
"149",746280,748430,"She, uh...","Interiors"
"150",748560,751836,"she put Dad through law school andfinanced the start ofhis practice.","Interiors"
"151",751960,755032,"So in a sense, it waslike he was her creation.","Interiors"
"152",758680,761433,"We kept getting shuffledaround to aunts and cousins.","Interiors"
"153",761560,764632,"And l guess Joey had the worst of it, cos...","Interiors"
"154",766600,771071,"As a kid, Joey was very high-strung.She was a bright kid, you know? She...","Interiors"
"155",771200,773077,"She was very sensitive.","Interiors"
"156",773840,777753,"We'd spend some time with Dad,mostly long Sunday breakfasts.","Interiors"
"157",778360,782956,"I always resented his relationship to her.I always felt that he favoured Joey.","Interiors"
"158",783520,786671,"It just seemed that they werevery close and that l was left out.","Interiors"
"159",787680,789716,"I like Frederick.","Interiors"
"160",789840,793799,"He has dignity... and promise as a writer.","Interiors"
"161",795200,797634,"My own strength is visual.","Interiors"
"162",798680,801114,"Your images are visual, Renata.","Interiors"
"163",802040,804349,"And in all candour,","Interiors"
"164",804480,806596,"I much prefer Frederick to Mike.","Interiors"
"165",806720,808392,"Mike's fine, Mother.","Interiors"
"166",808520,811478,"Well, he uses a very strong aftershave.","Interiors"
"167",811600,815878,"- It permeates the house.- I don't wanna talk about it.","Interiors"
"168",816000,819629,"Do you think that if l bought himanother kind of cologne he would switch?","Interiors"
"169",819760,823673,"- Can we talk about something else?- Well, let me give him some.","Interiors"
"170",823800,826837,"Then we won't have to talkabout it. It'll just be my gift.","Interiors"
"171",826960,829349,"Could we please talkabout something else?","Interiors"
"172",829680,833559,"(Arthur) Look, l wanna say something.I'm gonna be very direct.","Interiors"
"173",833680,836114,"I think the occasion calls for it.","Interiors"
"174",837480,841632,"I've done a lot ofthinking about this matter","Interiors"
"175",841760,845150,"and a great deal of soul-searching.","Interiors"
"176",845280,849239,"Now that the girls are all on their own,l feel that for my own self","Interiors"
"177",850280,852953,"I must come to this decision,","Interiors"
"178",853080,855514,"though l don't take it lightly.","Interiors"
"179",856240,861189,"I feel l've been a dedicatedhusband and a responsible father,","Interiors"
"180",861320,865029,"and l haven't regretted anythingl've been called upon to do.","Interiors"
"181",866760,870230,"Now l feel l want to beby myself for a while.","Interiors"
"182",873160,876755,"And consequently, l'vedecided to move out of the house.","Interiors"
"183",876880,881317,"I don't know how l'll feel about it whenl finally do it, and it's not irrevocable,","Interiors"
"184",882320,884754,"but l feel it's something l have to try.","Interiors"
"185",887680,891355,"Now, as l say, it's notan irrevocable situation.","Interiors"
"186",891960,893837,"It's a separation.","Interiors"
"187",894240,897312,"It may be for the best. It may not.","Interiors"
"188",899760,903469,"But l wanted to lay it onthe table so that everything is open","Interiors"
"189",903600,905670,"and as direct as possible.","Interiors"
"190",916920,919832,"Will you please not breathe so hard?","Interiors"
"191",925920,928070,"- I'll move out.- What does that mean?","Interiors"
"192",929080,932516,"- I don't want to live in this house.- Eve, think about it.","Interiors"
"193",933040,935952,"- I'll move out!- Look, it's not irrevocable.","Interiors"
"194",936080,938435,"It's a trial separation.","Interiors"
"195",939760,942069,"I can't be alone.","Interiors"
"196",943320,946551,"- Eve...- I don't wanna discuss the details now.","Interiors"
"197",950280,952714,"It's a very bad time for me.","Interiors"
"198",960520,962954,"My impotence set in a year ago.","Interiors"
"199",965840,967592,"My paralysis.","Interiors"
"200",970560,972869,"I suddenly foundl couldn't write any more.","Interiors"
"201",973000,977551,"Rather, l shouldn't say suddenly.Actually, it started happening last winter.","Interiors"
"202",982800,987032,"Increasing thoughts about deathjust seemed to come over me.","Interiors"
"203",987160,989196,"um, these, uh...","Interiors"
"204",993600,996239,"A preoccupation with my own mortality.","Interiors"
"205",998280,1002432,"These... feelings of futilityin relation to my work.","Interiors"

"207",1006160,1009596,"I mean, to what end?For what purpose, what goal?","Interiors"
"208",1012280,1014236,"I mean...","Interiors"

"210",1019520,1022398,"Is that supposed to besome sort of compensation?","Interiors"
"211",1024360,1026635,"I used to think it was,","Interiors"

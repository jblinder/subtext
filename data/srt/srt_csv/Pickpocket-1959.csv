"307",3245208,3246505,"Why?","Pickpocket"
"308",3247110,3251069,"Perhaps to avoid troublefor a relative or friend.","Pickpocket"

"344",3441671,3443730,"Was it her?","Pickpocket"
"345",3445708,3447335,"So she knew.","Pickpocket"

"347",3451080,3452604,"Did I know what?","Pickpocket"
"348",3454217,3455946,"But now you know.","Pickpocket"
"349",3464761,3467059,"Are you all tryingto drive me mad?","Pickpocket"
"350",3472535,3475470,"The police questioned youabout me.","Pickpocket"
"351",3476139,3477766,"They never mentioned you.","Pickpocket"
"352",3477974,3480807,"You see me livingwithout any income...","Pickpocket"
"353",3483446,3485471,"at least that I admit to.","Pickpocket"
"354",3488485,3490282,"And you can't guess?","Pickpocket"

"362",3524587,3527181,"Knowing a deed is baddoesn't stop you.","Pickpocket"
"363",3527390,3529153,"But why?","Pickpocket"
"364",3530894,3532418,"To get ahead.","Pickpocket"
"365",3533663,3535824,"I was frustrated getting nowhere.","Pickpocket"
"366",3537033,3539228,"There were other ways.","Pickpocket"
"367",3539769,3541293,"You accept it.","Pickpocket"

"369",3546042,3548135,"placing all the burden on you.","Pickpocket"
"370",3548444,3550071,"That's how it is.","Pickpocket"
"371",3551581,3553412,"How what is?","Pickpocket"
"372",3555084,3558349,"I don't know.Perhaps everything has a reason.","Pickpocket"

"374",3569198,3570631,"Tell the truth.","Pickpocket"

"378",3588151,3590051,"I won't shake your hand, then.","Pickpocket"
"379",3597961,3599826,"It's all too horrible.","Pickpocket"
"380",3606836,3608565,"Are you going away?","Pickpocket"
"381",3610873,3613205,"That idea suddenlyseemed possible.","Pickpocket"
"382",3636499,3638660,"I recallwanting to take a suitcase.","Pickpocket"
"383",3653750,3655945,"I hardly knew anymorewhat I was doing.","Pickpocket"
"384",3690620,3692679,"Would they let mereach the station?","Pickpocket"
"385",3720049,3722074,"I went right to the ticket window.","Pickpocket"

"389",3796826,3800125,"I spent two years in London,pulling off good jobs.","Pickpocket"
"390",3800329,3803958,"But I lost my earnings at cardsor wasted them on women.","Pickpocket"
"391",3804167,3807432,"I ended up in Paris,drifting and penniless.","Pickpocket"
"392",3823119,3825485,"I ended up therealmost by accident.","Pickpocket"
"393",3833062,3834791,"The place seemed empty.","Pickpocket"

"395",3867530,3869157,"What did your father say?","Pickpocket"
"396",3871200,3874397,"He took my sister and left.He took all I had.","Pickpocket"
"397",3875204,3877866,"But it's no crime to have a child.","Pickpocket"

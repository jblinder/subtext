"466",3720435,3724980,"I have shed my tears for Brom,and yet my heart is not broken.","Sleepy Hollow"
"467",3727650,3730944,"- Do you think me wicked?- No.","Sleepy Hollow"
"468",3732697,3735741,"But perhaps there is a bitof a witch in you, Katrina.","Sleepy Hollow"
"469",3736618,3740704,"- Why do you say that?- Because you have bewitched me.","Sleepy Hollow"
"470",3754177,3755177,"Oh.","Sleepy Hollow"
"471",3755845,3759514,"- You slept like the dead.- You're too kind to me.","Sleepy Hollow"
"472",3760058,3762392,"I do not look to be servedby the lady of the house.","Sleepy Hollow"
"473",3762477,3766980,"Nor would you be,but that the servant girl has vanished.","Sleepy Hollow"
"474",3767023,3770984,"- Sarah?- Run away like so many others.","Sleepy Hollow"
"475",3771569,3773528,"They're all leaving in fear.","Sleepy Hollow"
"476",3775198,3776990,"Where is Katrina?","Sleepy Hollow"
"477",3777700,3781787,"She watched over you till dawn.Now it is her turn to sleep.","Sleepy Hollow"
"478",3787752,3790712,"Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.","Sleepy Hollow"
"479",3792757,3795592,"Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.","Sleepy Hollow"
"480",3797595,3800973,"Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck,","Sleepy Hollow"
"481",3804560,3809022,"Notary Hardenbrook,and Magistrate Philipse.","Sleepy Hollow"
"482",3810900,3813527,"Who tried to cut and run,and lost his head.","Sleepy Hollow"
"483",3814445,3817406,"All frightened men,arguing together on the very night","Sleepy Hollow"
"484",3817490,3819825,"Magistrate Philipse was killed.","Sleepy Hollow"
"485",3821869,3824079,"There is conspiracy here.","Sleepy Hollow"
"486",3828334,3831712,"The doctor, the reverend, the notary","Sleepy Hollow"
"487",3832255,3834047,"and the magistrate.","Sleepy Hollow"
"488",3835925,3838552,"What is this secret that unites them?","Sleepy Hollow"
"489",3841889,3845142,"Magistrate Philipse knewthere were five bodies to four graves.","Sleepy Hollow"
"490",3846602,3848979,"He knew the Widow was pregnant.","Sleepy Hollow"
"491",3849939,3852482,"He would not tell methe name of the father.","Sleepy Hollow"
"492",3853359,3855652,"What does this point to?","Sleepy Hollow"
"493",3863036,3865871,"We must proceedby a process of elimination.","Sleepy Hollow"
"494",3866330,3869332,"I shall make a list ofevery man and woman in Sleepy Hollow,","Sleepy Hollow"
"495",3869417,3872878,"starting with its chief citizen,Baltus Van Tassel.","Sleepy Hollow"
"496",3875840,3877883,"I feel we're getting very close.","Sleepy Hollow"
"497",3877967,3881595,"Yes, I supposeBaltus is the chief citizen,","Sleepy Hollow"
"498",3881637,3883722,"now that old Van Garrett is dead.","Sleepy Hollow"
"499",3883890,3888727,"Yes, the Van Garretts.I'd almost forgotten them.","Sleepy Hollow"
"500",3900782,3902157,"Come with me.","Sleepy Hollow"
"501",3902283,3904576,"- Where?- To Notary Hardenbrook's.","Sleepy Hollow"
"502",3904660,3909498,"- Have you thought of something?- Yes. I have.","Sleepy Hollow"
"503",3924806,3926348,"Hopeless.","Sleepy Hollow"
"504",3935233,3939528,"My father's satchel. Why is it here?","Sleepy Hollow"
"505",3944033,3945867,"- Leave me alone.- Notary Hardenbrook.","Sleepy Hollow"
"506",3945910,3947869,"Leave me alone!","Sleepy Hollow"
"507",3947954,3950288,"Just as soon as you show methe last will and testament","Sleepy Hollow"
"508",3950373,3952040,"of old man Van Garrett.","Sleepy Hollow"
"509",3952208,3955043,"The will leaves everything to his son.","Sleepy Hollow"
"510",3955086,3959381,"Who died with him.So the estate passes to the next of kin.","Sleepy Hollow"
"511",3959465,3963593,"- Naturally. All legal and above board.- Sir.","Sleepy Hollow"
"512",3965972,3968765,"I'm a dead man. No.","Sleepy Hollow"
"513",3970268,3973228,"Van Garrett's seal. Broken.","Sleepy Hollow"
"514",3975898,3978817,"Seems Van Garrettmade a new will just before he died.","Sleepy Hollow"
"515",3978901,3983238,"Naming Widow Winship?","Sleepy Hollow"
"516",3983364,3986741,"And here, look. A marriage certificate.","Sleepy Hollow"
"517",3989370,3991746,"Old Van Garrettsecretly married the Widow.","Sleepy Hollow"
"518",3991789,3994791,"Left everything to herand her unborn child.","Sleepy Hollow"
"519",3995793,3998962,"So the new willstood between the Van Garrett fortune","Sleepy Hollow"
"520",3999046,4002090,"and the person who would haveotherwise inherited everything.","Sleepy Hollow"
"521",4002133,4006928,"It's true. But we four were drawn inagainst our will.","Sleepy Hollow"
"522",4007346,4009681,"- Your will?- He means...","Sleepy Hollow"
"523",4010099,4013560,"Of course. The four town elders.","Sleepy Hollow"
"524",4014270,4016938,"Now I see what parts you had to play.","Sleepy Hollow"
"525",4018191,4021610,"Reverend Steenwyck knew the secretbecause he performed the marriage.","Sleepy Hollow"
"526",4021652,4024446,"Dr. Lancaster attendedthe pregnant woman.","Sleepy Hollow"
"527",4024864,4027699,"Magistrate Philipsegave protection of the law.","Sleepy Hollow"
"528",4027950,4030619,"And Notary Hardenbrookconcealed the documents,","Sleepy Hollow"
"529",4030995,4034372,"which had been entrustedby Van Garrett to his faithful servant.","Sleepy Hollow"
"530",4034457,4037292,"The four conspiratorsdrawn into the plot.","Sleepy Hollow"
"531",4037710,4040795,"We did not knowit was a murdering plot.","Sleepy Hollow"
"532",4040838,4042881,"But I have not finished, sir.","Sleepy Hollow"
"533",4043132,4046468,"First, the Van Garretts, father and son,slain by a horseman","Sleepy Hollow"
"534",4046552,4048511,"raised from the grave to chop heads.","Sleepy Hollow"
"535",4048596,4052474,"Now, up pops a widow with a claimon a fortune. Off with her head!","Sleepy Hollow"
"536",4053142,4055310,"But murder begets murder.","Sleepy Hollow"
"537",4055937,4059147,"It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath.","Sleepy Hollow"
"538",4059815,4062817,"The night father and sonquarreled over the new will,","Sleepy Hollow"
"539",4062985,4066071,"Jonathan Masbath was summonedupstairs to bear witness.","Sleepy Hollow"
"540",4066906,4068657,"Here is his signature.","Sleepy Hollow"
"541",4068699,4071493,"I'm afraid it was his death warrant,young Masbath.","Sleepy Hollow"
"542",4071577,4073912,"The Horseman came for him.","Sleepy Hollow"
"543",4075164,4079042,"Came for him at the bidding ofsomeone who had power over him.","Sleepy Hollow"
"544",4079418,4082629,"Someone who dug in the earth inthe Western Woods and stole the skull.","Sleepy Hollow"
"545",4082672,4085257,"The missing head, which mustbe restored to the Horseman","Sleepy Hollow"
"546",4085341,4087259,"before he will return to Hell.","Sleepy Hollow"
"547",4087468,4090303,"Someone who stood to gainor lose a fortune.","Sleepy Hollow"
"548",4090805,4095767,"None other than Van Garrett'snext of kin, Baltus Van Tassel!","Sleepy Hollow"
"549",4101983,4106861,"- Katrina? Why are you in my room?- Because it is yours.","Sleepy Hollow"
"550",4110574,4114536,"- Was it wicked of me?- No. No, not at all.","Sleepy Hollow"
"551",4116414,4118581,"I missed you. Where did you go?","Sleepy Hollow"
"552",4118666,4121668,"To the notary.I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.","Sleepy Hollow"
"553",4122044,4124421,"And did you learn anything of interest?","Sleepy Hollow"
"554",4126674,4128049,"Perhaps.","Sleepy Hollow"
"555",4128843,4130885,"- My father...- Your father?","Sleepy Hollow"
"556",4131137,4135056,"Yes. My father thinksyou should return to New York.","Sleepy Hollow"
"557",4135182,4138393,"Really? Why is that?","Sleepy Hollow"
"558",4139020,4140729,"I don't know.","Sleepy Hollow"
"559",4141063,4144482,"Perhaps he looked in your ledgerand did not like what he saw.","Sleepy Hollow"
"560",4150031,4154075,"- What have you there?- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...","Sleepy Hollow"
"561",4154160,4156411,"Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.","Sleepy Hollow"
"562",4170926,4175388,"- It's just a spider.- Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it!","Sleepy Hollow"
"563",4177683,4180268,"- There's something under here.- What is it?","Sleepy Hollow"
"564",4182229,4185231,"- Help me move the bed.- No, no, I mustn't. You do it.","Sleepy Hollow"
"565",4192031,4196868,"The evil eye. It is someonecasting spells against you.","Sleepy Hollow"
"566",4198662,4200455,"The evil eye?","Sleepy Hollow"
"567",4251590,4253133,"Wait here.","Sleepy Hollow"
"568",4328584,4332921,"Katrina, you took the evidence","Sleepy Hollow"
"569",4333005,4334047,"and burned it.","Sleepy Hollow"
"570",4334089,4336591,"So you would not have itto accuse my father.","Sleepy Hollow"
"571",4336675,4338426,"I accuse no one.","Sleepy Hollow"
"572",4338511,4340386,"But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,","Sleepy Hollow"
"573",4340429,4341971,"no matter how much it grieves me.","Sleepy Hollow"
"574",4342056,4344599,"And no spells of yourscan alter it, either.","Sleepy Hollow"
"575",4344642,4346142,"Your father has the motive.","Sleepy Hollow"
"576",4346227,4348436,"It is he who stands to profitfrom these murders.","Sleepy Hollow"
"577",4348479,4352106,"If you knew him, you would not havesuch harsh thoughts about him.","Sleepy Hollow"
"578",4352358,4354400,"No, nor if you felt anything for me.","Sleepy Hollow"
"579",4354443,4356236,"I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.","Sleepy Hollow"
"580",4356278,4358530,"Why else did his four friendsconspire to conceal...","Sleepy Hollow"
"581",4358614,4360448,"You are the constable, not I.","Sleepy Hollow"
"582",4360491,4363117,"So find another chain of reasoningand let me be.","Sleepy Hollow"
"583",4363160,4368081,"I cannot, not the one or the other.And I am heartsick with it.","Sleepy Hollow"
"584",4368415,4373127,"I think you have no heart.And I had a mind once to give you mine.","Sleepy Hollow"
"585",4374088,4377757,"Yes, I think you loved me that daywhen you followed me","Sleepy Hollow"
"586",4377800,4380802,"into the Western Woodsto have braved such peril.","Sleepy Hollow"
"587",4380886,4382178,"What peril was there for me,","Sleepy Hollow"
"588",4382263,4385640,"if it was my own father who controlledthe Headless Horseman?","Sleepy Hollow"
"589",4390563,4392021,"Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.","Sleepy Hollow"
"590",4392106,4394774,"I curse the dayyou came to Sleepy Hollow.","Sleepy Hollow"

"592",4406704,4409038,"Only that she will not come down.","Sleepy Hollow"
"593",4410165,4412250,"I see. Thank you.","Sleepy Hollow"
"594",4412501,4414335,"Constable?","Sleepy Hollow"
"595",4415754,4419507,"You have not asked me howI have hurt my hand since yesterday,","Sleepy Hollow"
"596",4420467,4422343,"which would have been polite.","Sleepy Hollow"
"597",4424013,4426347,"In fact, you have been as careful","Sleepy Hollow"
"598",4426724,4430602,"not to look at it as not to mention it.","Sleepy Hollow"
"599",4432146,4434731,"Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...","Sleepy Hollow"
"600",4434815,4438192,"- I know you saw me.- What?","Sleepy Hollow"

"610",4464720,4467555,"If you are wise, you will leave this place.","Sleepy Hollow"
"611",4469141,4473061,"- What is that?- I was careless with the kitchen knife.","Sleepy Hollow"
"612",4473103,4474854,"The wound looks angry.","Sleepy Hollow"
"613",4474897,4478399,"I will bind it laterwith wild arrowroot flowers.","Sleepy Hollow"

"667",5069658,5073494,"He saw the Horseman cometowards me with his sword unsheathed,","Sleepy Hollow"
"668",5073912,5077331,"but it is I who govern the Horseman,my dear.","Sleepy Hollow"
"669",5077666,5080167,"And Baltus did not stay to watch.","Sleepy Hollow"
"670",5084673,5088175,"- But there was a body.- The servant girl, Sarah.","Sleepy Hollow"
"671",5088218,5090594,"And I always thought she was useless.","Sleepy Hollow"

"679",5128383,5131051,"No one in this God-fearing townwould take us in","Sleepy Hollow"
"680",5131136,5133971,"because my motherwas suspected of witchcraft.","Sleepy Hollow"
"681",5134723,5136598,"But she schooled her daughters well,","Sleepy Hollow"
"682",5136683,5139852,"while we lived as outcastsin the Western Woods.","Sleepy Hollow"
"683",5140603,5143188,"She died within a year.","Sleepy Hollow"

"289",2536327,2540373,"I haven't seen anything like that,except molecular acid.","Alien"
"290",2540498,2543710,"It must be using it for blood.","Alien"
"291",2543835,2547797,"It's got a wonderful defense mechanism.You don't dare kill it.","Alien"
"292",2547880,2549967,"What about Kane?","Alien"
"293",2551969,2554137,"Here's your pen back.","Alien"

"297",2574074,2575826,"Try it.","Alien"
"298",2580956,2584918,"- Damn it. I felt sure that was it.- Try it again.","Alien"
"299",2586253,2590340,"Feel like I've been in this place a month.","Alien"
"300",2590423,2594510,"We shouldn't have landed herein the first place.","Alien"
"301",2594594,2598891,"We shouldn't have landedon this damn ball, I know that.","Alien"
"302",2598974,2603478,"The sooner we patch this thing up andget outta here, the sooner we can go home.","Alien"
"303",2603561,2605355,"This place gives me the creeps.","Alien"
"304",2668835,2671255,"It's amazing. What is it?","Alien"
"305",2673005,2675092,"I'd say it's, um...","Alien"
"306",2676342,2678427,"I don't know yet.","Alien"
"307",2682932,2686143,"- Do you want something?- Yes, I, uh...","Alien"
"308",2688438,2691275,"A little talk. How's Kane?","Alien"
"309",2691358,2693860,"He's holding. No changes.","Alien"
"310",2693985,2696572,"And, uh, our guest?","Alien"
"311",2701702,2705121,"Well, as I said, I'm still collating, actually.","Alien"
"312",2705246,2710793,"But I have confirmed that he's gotan outer layer of protein polysaccharides.","Alien"
"313",2710878,2717467,"He has a funny habit of shedding his cellsand replacing them with polarized silicone,","Alien"
"314",2717550,2723599,"which gives him a prolonged resistanceto adverse environmental conditions.","Alien"
"315",2723724,2725684,"Is that enough?","Alien"
"316",2725809,2728103,"That's plenty. What does it mean?","Alien"
"317",2728186,2732690,"- Please don't do that. Thank you.- I'm sorry.","Alien"
"318",2732773,2739155,"It's an interesting combination of elements,making him a... tough little son of a bitch.","Alien"
"319",2739239,2741657,"And you let him in.","Alien"
"320",2741742,2744161,"I was obeying a direct order, remember?","Alien"
"321",2744869,2750501,"Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship,I'm senior officer.","Alien"
"322",2750626,2752710,"Oh, yes. I forgot.","Alien"
"323",2753628,2757715,"You also forgot the Science Division'sbasic quarantine law.","Alien"
"324",2757798,2762094,"- No, that I didn't forget.- Oh, I see. You just broke it.","Alien"
"325",2762179,2765641,"What would you havedone with Kane? Hm?","Alien"
"326",2765724,2769061,"You knew his only chance of survivalwas to get him in here.","Alien"
"327",2769186,2773565,"Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,you risk everybody's life.","Alien"
"328",2773648,2776068,"Maybe I should have left him outside.","Alien"
"329",2776150,2780655,"Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,but it was a risk I was willing to take.","Alien"
"330",2780739,2784701,"It's a pretty big risk for a science officer.","Alien"
"331",2784827,2788454,"It's not exactly out of the manual, is it?","Alien"
"332",2789831,2793251,"I do take my responsibilitiesas seriously as you.","Alien"
"333",2794460,2798422,"You do your joband let me do mine. Yes?","Alien"

"335",2830329,2833583,"- Why?- Something's happened.","Alien"
"336",2833666,2836378,"- Serious?- Interesting.","Alien"
"337",2841592,2845344,"Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.","Alien"
"338",2848181,2851393,"- Where is it?- Well, I don't know!","Alien"
"339",2851518,2856106,"- We have to try and find it.- Let's check it.","Alien"
"340",2881005,2883634,"Dallas, please be careful.","Alien"
"341",2924423,2926592,"Sorry.","Alien"
"342",2959041,2962045,"No, not in the corner!","Alien"
"343",2962170,2965590,"Have one of these. Just in case.","Alien"
"344",2978644,2980313,"Kane?","Alien"
"345",2986152,2987820,"Are you OK?","Alien"
"346",2987905,2992201,"- I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead?- It was up there somewhere.","Alien"
"347",2992284,2996579,"- My God.- Cover the damn thing, will you?","Alien"
"348",2996663,2998748,"It's alive.","Alien"
"349",3003045,3004086,"We've got to have a look at this.","Alien"
"350",3017643,3019728,"Excuse me.","Alien"
"351",3025358,3030030,"- It seems dead enough.- Good. Let's get rid of it.","Alien"
"352",3030155,3035994,"Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first timewe've encountered a species like this.","Alien"
"353",3036077,3038996,"It has to go back.All sorts of tests have to be made.","Alien"
"354",3039121,3043918,"Ash, are you kidding? This thing bled acid.Who knows what it will do when it's dead?","Alien"
"355",3044001,3047130,"I think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.","Alien"
"356",3047255,3050050,"Dallas, it has to go back.","Alien"
"357",3050175,3055389,"I'd soon as not burn it at the stake,but you're the science officer.","Alien"
"358",3055472,3057891,"- It's your decision, Ash.- Dallas!","Alien"
"359",3057974,3062271,"- You won't make me change my mind...- I'm not trying to change your mind.","Alien"
"360",3062353,3064981,"I just want you to listen...Will you listen?","Alien"
"361",3067067,3071237,"- How can you leave that decision to him?- I just run the ship.","Alien"
"362",3071320,3074240,"Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.","Alien"
"363",3074365,3077577,"- How does that happen?- That's what the company wants.","Alien"
"364",3077702,3083125,"- Since when is that standard procedure?- Standard procedure is to do what they say.","Alien"
"365",3083208,3086961,"- What's happening with the repairs?- They're pretty much finished.","Alien"
"366",3087086,3088838,"- Why didn't you tell me?- There's still some things to do.","Alien"
"367",3091757,3093844,"We're blind on B and C decks,the reserve power system's blown...","Alien"
"368",3096054,3098639,"That's horseshit. We can take off without that.","Alien"
"369",3098764,3103144,"- We can. You think that's a good idea?- Look, I just wanna get the hell outta here.","Alien"
"370",3127418,3130047,"Dust in the intakes.Number two's overheating.","Alien"
"371",3130172,3132465,"Spit on it for two minutes, for Christ sake!","Alien"

"379",3187728,3190940,"When we fix something, it stays fixed.Don't we, Brett, baby?","Alien"
"380",3191065,3192108,"Right!","Alien"
"381",3207623,3211503,"We should freeze him. If he's got a disease,why don't we stop it there?","Alien"
"382",3211586,3215132,"- We can get to a doctor back home.- Right.","Alien"
"383",3215257,3219427,"Whenever he says anything,you say ""Right"", Brett, you know?","Alien"

"430",3550384,3554346,"Just make damn surenobody puts their hand on the end of it.","Alien"
"431",3556931,3561228,"It shouldn't damage the bastardunless its skin is thinner than ours.","Alien"
"432",3561311,3565273,"But it will give him a little incentive.","Alien"
"433",3565398,3567568,"Now we just have to find him.","Alien"
"434",3567693,3571320,"I've taken care of that.I've designed this tracking device.","Alien"
"435",3571445,3574449,"You just set it to search for a moving object.","Alien"
"436",3576117,3580621,"Hasn't got much of a range, but withina certain distance, it gives off a signal.","Alien"
"437",3580706,3583750,"What does it key on?","Alien"
"438",3583833,3587713,"Micro changes in air density.","Alien"

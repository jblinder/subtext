"236",1266928,1268040,"What's that?","Furious 7"
"237",1270103,1271362,"Don't miss.","Furious 7"
"238",1274018,1277653,"MONTECRISTO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC","Furious 7"
"239",1280490,1282384,"Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando.","Furious 7"
"240",1282467,1283632,"I hope it's not a problem.","Furious 7"
"241",1283633,1286561,"Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days.","Furious 7"
"242",1286673,1287807,"That was a problem.","Furious 7"
"243",1288031,1290053,"Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic,","Furious 7"
"244",1290143,1291361,"that is vacation.","Furious 7"
"245",1291476,1292810,"Anyone messes with you here...","Furious 7"
"246",1292926,1294820,"they're messing with the entire country.","Furious 7"
"247",1294894,1295976,"You'll be safe.","Furious 7"
"248",1300661,1307335,"Yeah, they're here. I picked them up myself at the airport.","Furious 7"
"249",1307452,1309513,"Hold on. Your brother.","Furious 7"
"250",1310150,1311150,"Dom.","Furious 7"
"251",1311173,1312477,"Yeah, Mia, it's me.","Furious 7"
"252",1312595,1313595,"How's it going there?","Furious 7"
"253",1313652,1316320,"We're at Mando's. This place is like a fortress.","Furious 7"
"254",1316393,1319840,"You should see Brian. He's in full FBI mode.","Furious 7"
"255",1319951,1323124,"He built a surveillance hub in Mando's garage and everything.","Furious 7"
"256",1323237,1325682,"What about you? Did you find out who's after us?","Furious 7"
"257",1325797,1328666,"Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.","Furious 7"
"258",1328778,1330540,"How did Buster take the news?","Furious 7"
"259",1330652,1331652,"I can't tell him.","Furious 7"
"260",1331739,1334195,"If he knew about the baby, he'd stay here with us.","Furious 7"
"261",1334278,1337042,"And with all that's going on, you're gonna need him by your side.","Furious 7"
"262",1337714,1340067,"Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.","Furious 7"
"263",1340179,1342086,"And come home together.","Furious 7"
"264",1342170,1344823,"Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days.","Furious 7"
"265",1345566,1346566,"Where are you going?","Furious 7"
"266",1346589,1347589,"Tokyo.","Furious 7"
"267",1348472,1350167,"I'm bringing Han home.","Furious 7"
"268",1352070,1354143,"Authorities are still trying to determine...","Furious 7"
"269",1354144,1356862,"the motive behind this daring attack here at the office...","Furious 7"
"270",1356973,1361285,"of the US Diplomatic Security Service in downtown Los 羘geles...","Furious 7"
"271",1361395,1362435,"less than 36 hours ago.","Furious 7"
"272",1363242,1364825,"Facts are still coming in...","Furious 7"
"273",1364933,1367933,"but what is known is the suspect entered the building's 4th floor...","Furious 7"
"274",1369292,1370292,"Hey.","Furious 7"
"275",1370927,1372369,"- You okay? - Yeah.","Furious 7"
"276",1373162,1376380,"This guy's just, relentless.","Furious 7"
"277",1378282,1379798,"That's why Dom needs you.","Furious 7"
"278",1380665,1383361,"You two need to find this guy and you need to stop him...","Furious 7"
"279",1383467,1385769,"before he does any more damage to our family.","Furious 7"
"280",1388085,1389173,"I just...","Furious 7"
"281",1391270,1392923,"I've screwed up so many things.","Furious 7"
"282",1393904,1396853,"I couldn't live with myself if I screwed this up, too.","Furious 7"
"283",1396968,1398880,"You won't.","Furious 7"
"284",1399923,1401115,"I believe in you.","Furious 7"
"285",1402041,1404779,"I believe in us. That's all that matters.","Furious 7"
"286",1406473,1407654,"I love you, Brian.","Furious 7"
"287",1418079,1419512,"Love you, baby.","Furious 7"
"288",1420515,1424304,"Just promise me. After this, we're done.","Furious 7"
"289",1424419,1426761,"No more jobs, no more enemies.","Furious 7"
"290",1427674,1428896,"Come back to us.","Furious 7"
"291",1429011,1430884,"I won't let you down, Mia.","Furious 7"
"292",1432751,1433761,"I know.","Furious 7"
"293",1436077,1438772,"TOKYO, JAPAN","Furious 7"
"294",1449789,1450789,"Hey yo, Sean!","Furious 7"
"295",1450814,1452469,"Hey, check this out, man.","Furious 7"
"296",1452540,1455026,"This dude over here wanna race the new DK.","Furious 7"
"297",1455106,1456271,"Not tonight, Twinkie.","Furious 7"
"298",1458403,1459803,"He said he knew Han.","Furious 7"
"299",1466039,1470244,"Han said you was fast, but not that damn fast.","Furious 7"
"300",1471154,1473520,"Who said American muscle can't drift?","Furious 7"
"301",1474782,1477811,"Han mentioned he left his enemies in his rear view.","Furious 7"
"302",1479330,1480960,"He never talked about it much.","Furious 7"
"303",1482575,1484665,"Always playing it close to the vest.","Furious 7"
"304",1490035,1492305,"We found a couple of things by the crash.","Furious 7"
"305",1494219,1495298,"Wasn't much left.","Furious 7"
"306",1502487,1503788,"Gisele.","Furious 7"
"307",1508060,1509060,"Yeah.","Furious 7"
"308",1509884,1511325,"There's one more thing.","Furious 7"
"309",1514321,1515614,"I found this.","Furious 7"
"310",1519875,1521182,"Must've meant something to him.","Furious 7"
"311",1522260,1524211,"When you find the guy that killed Han...","Furious 7"
"312",1525299,1527065,"What are you going to do?","Furious 7"
"313",1528705,1531730,"Words ain't even been invented yet.","Furious 7"
"314",1553247,1556551,"They say to live in the hearts of those we leave behind...","Furious 7"
"315",1556698,1558932,"is not to die.","Furious 7"
"316",1560025,1561789,"But he put you in his grave.","Furious 7"
"317",1563919,1566689,"So now I'll do the same to him.","Furious 7"
"318",1571136,1573133,"I can't do no more funerals.","Furious 7"
"319",1574901,1575922,"First, Han...","Furious 7"
"320",1578635,1581221,"Now Hobbs is laid out, of all people.","Furious 7"
"321",1586526,1587963,"We're being hunted.","Furious 7"
"322",1594626,1596772,"You know he's out there somewhere watching, right?","Furious 7"
"323",1598018,1599072,"I hope so.","Furious 7"
"324",1599214,1600609,"That means he's close.","Furious 7"
"325",1601555,1603753,"Just promise me, Brian.","Furious 7"
"326",1604738,1606363,"No more funerals.","Furious 7"
"327",1607152,1608152,"Just one more.","Furious 7"
"328",1612197,1613197,"His.","Furious 7"
"329",1761170,1763797,"You never should've messed with a man's family.","Furious 7"
"330",1763909,1765891,"I told your brother the same thing.","Furious 7"
"331",1769263,1770857,"Reinforced your chassis.","Furious 7"
"332",1771796,1773873,"Just like going into the ring with weighted gloves.","Furious 7"
"333",1773874,1776394,"Your mistake. I'm not here to play games.","Furious 7"
"334",1777192,1778486,"See, you and me...","Furious 7"
"335",1779323,1780912,"We're from different worlds.","Furious 7"
"336",1781679,1784919,"Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner streets than the ones you're used to.","Furious 7"
"337",1785492,1786492,"Stick around.","Furious 7"
"338",1788049,1789493,"It's gonna get a lot meaner.","Furious 7"
"339",1792375,1794363,"You think this was gonna be a street fight?","Furious 7"
"340",1813449,1814782,"On the ground!","Furious 7"
"341",1815548,1816548,"Now!","Furious 7"
"342",1818874,1820607,"Drop him or I will drop you!","Furious 7"
"343",1820718,1821718,"Woah, woah!","Furious 7"
"344",1821972,1824832,"Easy, guys. We're on the same team here.","Furious 7"
"345",1825701,1827077,"Mr. Toretto...","Furious 7"
"346",1827182,1828728,"I'm here on the recommendation...","Furious 7"
"347",1828836,1830345,"of a, mutual friend of ours.","Furious 7"
"348",1830415,1832175,"- Mr. Hobbs? - Who the hell are you?","Furious 7"
"349",1832250,1833760,"Me? I'm just a guy.","Furious 7"
"350",1833829,1836240,"I'm, Mr. Nobody.","Furious 7"
"351",1836311,1838445,"That's a big entrance for a nobody.","Furious 7"
"352",1838912,1841305,"And the guy who put our mutual friend in the hospital...","Furious 7"
"353",1842500,1843990,"you just let him get away.","Furious 7"
"354",1844064,1847448,"I think I might've just saved your ass there, Dom.","Furious 7"
"355",1847822,1850743,"Listen, you think you can let go of my guy there?","Furious 7"
"356",1850853,1852403,"He's beginning to turn a little blue.","Furious 7"
"357",1854816,1855816,"I appreciate that.","Furious 7"
"358",1856605,1858042,"Here they come.","Furious 7"
"359",1858872,1859872,"Listen, Dom.","Furious 7"
"360",1859961,1864383,"There's a war going on between shadows and ghosts like me.","Furious 7"
"361",1866295,1869353,"You and your team unwittingly walked into the middle of it in London...","Furious 7"
"362",1869470,1871586,"and it appears it's now followed you home.","Furious 7"
"363",1874084,1875343,"It's up to you.","Furious 7"
"364",1876180,1877761,"I'm gonna have a beer.","Furious 7"
"365",1878553,1879553,"You're welcome to join me.","Furious 7"
"366",1879740,1882192,"By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.","Furious 7"
"367",1889046,1892405,"BASE OF OPERATIONS EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA","Furious 7"
"368",1895372,1896372,"Belgian ale.","Furious 7"
"369",1899686,1901651,"Man, those monks got it right.","Furious 7"
"370",1901763,1905759,"I don't know about the whole celibacy thing, but when it comes to beer...","Furious 7"
"371",1907305,1908305,"Would you like one?","Furious 7"
"372",1908328,1910714,"I'm more of a Corona man myself.","Furious 7"
"373",1914288,1917451,"Your files, not only detailed...","Furious 7"
"374",1918179,1921509,"It's, extremely entertaining.","Furious 7"
"375",1927480,1930585,"Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow.","Furious 7"
"376",1930734,1933396,"He's really good at getting in and out of places...","Furious 7"
"377",1933397,1935849,"without being seen and leaving nothing but a body count in his wake.","Furious 7"
"378",1936001,1939045,"He's a legitimate English badass.","Furious 7"
"379",1939324,1943134,"But to be honest with you Dom, I don't give two shits about Deckard Shaw.","Furious 7"
"380",1943473,1944548,"It's you I want.","Furious 7"
"381",1944654,1949164,"Because you and I can help each other get what we both need.","Furious 7"
"382",1950036,1951720,"I'm listening.","Furious 7"
"383",1951880,1953700,"Just recently, a private military company...","Furious 7"
"384",1953810,1956865,"led by a wanted terrorist named Mose Jakande...","Furious 7"
"385",1956980,1959385,"kidnapped a hacker known only by the name ""Ramsey"".","Furious 7"
"386",1960008,1962451,"Lady Liberty's got her panties in a bunch over this but rightfully so...","Furious 7"
"387",1962586,1965808,"because this Ramsey has created something interesting.","Furious 7"
"388",1966072,1967140,"- Bring it up. - Yes, sir.","Furious 7"
"389",1967733,1968736,"Say hello...","Furious 7"
"390",1969298,1971095,"To God's Eye.","Furious 7"
"391",1971344,1973970,"Now this little bastard hacks into anything that's on a digital network.","Furious 7"
"392",1974064,1977661,"That means every cellphone, satellite, ATM machine, and computer,","Furious 7"
"393",1977773,1978773,"simultaneously.","Furious 7"
"394",1979013,1982642,"If it's got a microphone or a lens, God's Eye can use it to find you.","Furious 7"
"395",1982747,1985230,"So you invited me here to show me a tracking device.","Furious 7"
"396",1985373,1986971,"On steroids. Lots of them.","Furious 7"
"397",1987078,1988558,"Let me put it to you this way.","Furious 7"
"398",1988665,1991621,"It took us nearly a decade to find Osama bin Laden.","Furious 7"
"399",1991734,1994352,"With this, we could locate him anywhere on the planet","Furious 7"
"400",1994458,1995582,"in a couple of hours.","Furious 7"
"401",1995692,1998105,"Now that's a serious piece of machinery...","Furious 7"
"402",1998179,2000340,"that could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.","Furious 7"
"403",2000414,2002607,"But for some very nauseating, political reasons...","Furious 7"
"404",2002717,2006815,"any rescue plans involving any US government forces or entity...","Furious 7"
"405",2006816,2008861,"has been strictly ruled out.","Furious 7"
"406",2009978,2012388,"And that's why I need you.","Furious 7"
"407",2012537,2014261,"But why do I need you?","Furious 7"
"408",2015133,2019112,"I mean I could go back outside, enjoy the rest of the Coronas...","Furious 7"
"409",2019782,2021257,"let Shaw come to me.","Furious 7"
"410",2021480,2024205,"You could do that. How's that working out for you so far?","Furious 7"
"411",2024326,2026655,"You got one friend in the ground, another one in the hospital...","Furious 7"
"412",2026766,2029005,"and then of course there's that little issue of the bomb...","Furious 7"
"413",2029156,2030412,"that destroyed your home.","Furious 7"
"414",2031701,2034613,"Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules.","Furious 7"
"415",2036169,2037169,"Like it or not...","Furious 7"
"416",2037179,2038984,"you live in that world now, too.","Furious 7"
"417",2040333,2042059,"You wanna know how to kill a shadow?","Furious 7"
"418",2042750,2044143,"You just shine a little light on it.","Furious 7"
"419",2044798,2046605,"If you get the God's Eye for me...","Furious 7"
"420",2046606,2050266,"I've already got authorization for you to use it until you get Shaw.","Furious 7"
"421",2050617,2052733,"You go from the hunted, to the hunter.","Furious 7"
"422",2052838,2055210,"And there's no place on Earth Shaw can hide from you.","Furious 7"
"423",2055322,2056492,"More importantly,","Furious 7"
"424",2057222,2059721,"you and your family...","Furious 7"
"425",2060769,2062547,"don't go to any more funerals.","Furious 7"
"426",2063472,2066574,"You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye...","Furious 7"
"427",2066681,2067789,"You get Shaw.","Furious 7"
"428",2069108,2071521,"Well that's the windup and the pitch.","Furious 7"
"429",2072463,2077331,"Now that I've given you this incredibly sensitive and highly classified information...","Furious 7"
"430",2078250,2079528,"What do you think, Toretto?","Furious 7"
"431",2079639,2082063,"I think you already know what I'm gonna do.","Furious 7"
"432",2082143,2083143,"Good.","Furious 7"
"433",2083255,2085744,"But, it'll be my way.","Furious 7"
"434",2086963,2088059,"And my crew.","Furious 7"
"435",2088170,2089931,"I assumed you might say that.","Furious 7"
"436",2090184,2093992,"Which is why I've taken the liberty of gathering your team.","Furious 7"
"437",2106398,2107762,"This is crazy.","Furious 7"
"438",2108809,2110612,"What the hell is going on in here?","Furious 7"
"439",2113396,2116653,"Our intelligence suggests that Ramsey will be transported...","Furious 7"
"440",2116726,2119155,"by an armed motorcade through the Caucasus mountain range.","Furious 7"
"441",2119268,2121418,"If they clear this range and reach their destination...","Furious 7"
"442",2121528,2123235,"Ramsey's as good as gone.","Furious 7"
"443",2123349,2124541,"So let me get this straight.","Furious 7"
"444",2124652,2126838,"There's only one road that leads in or out...?","Furious 7"
"445",2126945,2128789,"Sheer drops on every side...","Furious 7"
"446",2128896,2132070,"A motorcade from hell protected by a small army...","Furious 7"
"447",2132182,2133878,"from one mile on either direction?","Furious 7"
"448",2133958,2135751,"Yeah, that's about it.","Furious 7"
"449",2136844,2138284,"- You done? - No, I'm not done.","Furious 7"
"450",2138914,2142451,"So you all wanted me to break into a police station, fine.","Furious 7"
"451",2142574,2144378,"Then you asked me to stop a tank.","Furious 7"
"452",2144489,2146362,"I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.","Furious 7"
"453",2146436,2148284,"Then you came up with this brillant idea...","Furious 7"
"454",2148385,2151639,"to shoot down one of the largest airplanes, ever.","Furious 7"
"455",2151788,2153728,"I shot that shit outta the sky...","Furious 7"
"456",2155668,2156668,"It's nothing.","Furious 7"
"457",2156967,2158469,"But this right here, my friend...","Furious 7"
"458",2158579,2163012,"happens to be the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my life.","Furious 7"
"459",2163121,2165733,"I forgot that, you were the only one to bring that plane down.","Furious 7"
"460",2165829,2168851,"No, only thing I've ever seen him take down was ""No knees"" Denise.","Furious 7"
"461",2168931,2170451,"Remember? At prom?","Furious 7"
"462",2170927,2173179,"Really, Brian? You're gonna do that right here?","Furious 7"
"463",2173286,2175005,"See, y'all try'na get me off my point.","Furious 7"
"464",2175398,2178690,"All I'm saying is, I'm tired of everybody around me...","Furious 7"
"465",2178804,2180170,"making all the decisions.","Furious 7"
"466",2180967,2182268,"This time, I lead.","Furious 7"
"467",2182382,2185900,"Seriously. If I don't start making decisions, I'm out.","Furious 7"
"468",2185985,2187036,"All right, Roman.","Furious 7"
"469",2187789,2189213,"What do you got?","Furious 7"
"470",2190460,2195369,"I mean, I wouldn't try to get into the whole leadership thing, like, now.","Furious 7"
"471",2195445,2196806,"You know what I'm saying? I'm just kind of...","Furious 7"
"472",2196920,2198036,"Talking about like, at some point.","Furious 7"
"473",2198181,2199599,"Like, you know, when we...","Furious 7"
"474",2200181,2202181,"Whatever. I mean, I think...","Furious 7"
"475",2204824,2205824,"Let's hit it from here.","Furious 7"
"476",2205849,2207690,"- I don't think that that's... - No, don't think.","Furious 7"
"477",2208309,2209309,"That's my job.","Furious 7"
"478",2212528,2213528,"Okay.","Furious 7"
"479",2214693,2216817,"It is impossible to hit it there.","Furious 7"
"480",2217652,2220387,"That is literally the most secure spot on the mountain.","Furious 7"
"481",2220538,2223568,"Why? Because you cannot physically access it.","Furious 7"
"482",2223692,2225556,"Now see, that's what makes it so sweet.","Furious 7"
"483",2225702,2228746,"Because it's the place that they least expect us to hit them from.","Furious 7"
"484",2228849,2231811,"As much as I hate to admit it, he's on to something there.","Furious 7"
"485",2231925,2232925,"What do you think, Dom?","Furious 7"
"486",2233748,2234748,"Here?","Furious 7"
"487",2234771,2235771,"Yeah.","Furious 7"
"488",2236853,2238688,"I think we got a plan.","Furious 7"
"489",2238846,2241365,"Completely wrong thinking.","Furious 7"
"490",2241476,2242599,"And I like it.","Furious 7"
"491",2243003,2245166,"- You see? - I'm good at this.","Furious 7"
"492",2245860,2246860,"Good?","Furious 7"
"493",2246896,2248128,"Okay.","Furious 7"
"494",2248275,2250784,"How are you planning on getting on that road?","Furious 7"
"495",2251809,2253425,"Well, Tej?","Furious 7"
"496",2255690,2257489,"I think I may actually have a plan for that.","Furious 7"
"497",2258679,2260086,"What? I delegated.","Furious 7"
"498",2260963,2262436,"That's what good leaders do.","Furious 7"
"499",2263510,2264510,"Leader!","Furious 7"
"500",2264534,2267070,"You know, when I was reading your files...","Furious 7"
"501",2267186,2269563,"I was impressed with what you've accomplished with your team.","Furious 7"
"502",2269637,2272356,"But, meeting them now I gotta say, Dom...","Furious 7"
"503",2273501,2274880,"you truly have a gift.","Furious 7"
"504",2278346,2281996,"Consider my workshop your new playhouse.","Furious 7"
"505",2282106,2283500,"I think you'll find our cars...","Furious 7"
"506",2283617,2285315,"extremely appealing.","Furious 7"
"507",2286262,2287454,"And your team...","Furious 7"
"508",2288507,2289516,"is now complete.","Furious 7"
"509",2300552,2301844,"I went to the house.","Furious 7"
"510",2303355,2304849,"I was looking for you everywhere.","Furious 7"
"511",2306619,2308215,"You scared the shit outta me.","Furious 7"
"512",2312989,2314164,"You will never be alone...","Furious 7"
"513",2317521,2318643,"Where did you find that?","Furious 7"
"514",2322505,2323791,"Found it in Han's car.","Furious 7"
"515",2323900,2325677,"It was left as a message.","Furious 7"
"516",2325791,2327713,"A message I plan on returning.","Furious 7"
"517",2329490,2330594,"Can you ride?","Furious 7"
"518",2330706,2332253,"Yeah, of course I can.","Furious 7"
"519",2332802,2334568,"Han was my family, too.","Furious 7"
"520",2339224,2340224,"Brian!","Furious 7"
"521",2340905,2342891,"We're gonna need long travel suspension...","Furious 7"
"522",2342998,2345108,"limited slip differentials in all of them.","Furious 7"
"523",2345208,2346208,"How you doing.","Furious 7"
"524",2346762,2347791,"Tej!","Furious 7"
"525",2347909,2350887,"I want the demon lovechild between that...","Furious 7"
"526",2352210,2353539,"and that.","Furious 7"
"527",2355041,2356201,"That's a lot of armor.","Furious 7"
"528",2356313,2358981,"Just gonna add more weight, slow you down.","Furious 7"
"529",2361385,2363998,"This time it ain't just about being fast.","Furious 7"
"530",2370956,2372869,"Yeah, I'm good.","Furious 7"
"531",2374806,2376648,"From the streets, you know what I'm sayin'?","Furious 7"
"532",2376733,2378405,"It's nothing.","Furious 7"
"533",2384655,2386849,"Hey, Roman, you're freaking out, ain't you?","Furious 7"
"534",2386932,2389054,"- No. - Yeah, you are.","Furious 7"
"535",2389126,2390126,"I said, no.","Furious 7"
"536",2390286,2393586,"Listen man, it takes a grown man to embrace his feelings.","Furious 7"
"537",2393708,2395971,"If you need to cry, just go ahead and cry.","Furious 7"
"538",2397061,2399963,"As your friend, you know I'm concerned about your well-being.","Furious 7"
"539",2400141,2401550,"Which is why I took the precaution...","Furious 7"
"540",2401623,2404010,"of putting some adult diapers in your glove compartment.","Furious 7"
"541",2404081,2405320,"Can you just chill out, man?","Furious 7"
"542",2405931,2410074,"I have seen some crazy shit, Dom, but this really could make some waves.","Furious 7"
"543",2410150,2413005,"So let's just try to keep it as low key as possible, huh?","Furious 7"
"544",2413119,2414628,"Don't I always?","Furious 7"
"545",2414706,2417728,"I tell you what: you knock it down a couple of notches this time...","Furious 7"
"546",2417800,2421076,"and I'll swap out my Belgian for a keg of Corona.","Furious 7"
"547",2421858,2423925,"You'd be doing yourself a favor there.","Furious 7"
"548",2424902,2427414,"Can somebody just walk me through what we're supposed to be doing here?","Furious 7"
"549",2427476,2429318,"Come on, Rom. This was your plan, you gotta embrace it.","Furious 7"
"550",2429422,2430684,"No, this was not my plan.","Furious 7"
"551",2434902,2436505,"Yeah, here we go. Gametime.","Furious 7"
"552",2449599,2451570,"Roman, you need some fresh air?","Furious 7"
"553",2451597,2453514,"'Cause you about to get a whole lot of it.","Furious 7"
"554",2457164,2458469,"Okay, here we go!","Furious 7"
"555",2476565,2478590,"Just when you didn't think it can get any better, huh?","Furious 7"
"556",2485382,2486382,"Oh, shit!","Furious 7"
"557",2501407,2502407,"Now we're moving.","Furious 7"
"558",2509545,2512456,"Everybody good? Everybody make it out?","Furious 7"
"559",2517389,2519889,"You should tell 'em, that this is not for you!","Furious 7"
"560",2519891,2520965,"This is not your mission!","Furious 7"
"561",2521070,2523838,"Rom, what's up man! Talk to me, come on!","Furious 7"
"562",2524206,2526101,"- I can't do it. - The hell, you can't!","Furious 7"
"563",2526219,2529643,"Come on man! You throw that thing in reverse and get your ass out here now!","Furious 7"
"564",2529644,2532114,"Look I can't do it, okay? Listen to what I'm saying.","Furious 7"
"565",2532114,2533114,"Now isn't the time!","Furious 7"
"566",2533143,2534588,"I'mma stay up here with the pilot.","Furious 7"
"567",2534704,2537815,"We're gonna circle around and make sure we're holding them down from up here!","Furious 7"
"568",2537885,2539221,"We're running out of time!","Furious 7"
"569",2539333,2541492,"The chute is guided by GPS!","Furious 7"
"570",2541603,2543405,"You don't have to do anything!","Furious 7"
"571",2543483,2545181,"- Tej! - I'm already on it.","Furious 7"
"572",2545690,2547063,"Listen, man. Listen","Furious 7"
"573",2547208,2550521,"I'm sorry to let y'all down, okay? I'mma go ahead and stay up here.","Furious 7"
"574",2550646,2551447,"No, brother.","Furious 7"
"575",2551563,2553829,"- I'm sorry to let you down. - What?","Furious 7"
"576",2555487,2556487,"Is that...?","Furious 7"
"577",2559438,2561460,"Tej! What are you doing?","Furious 7"
"578",2564782,2568646,"No!","Furious 7"
"579",2568802,2569920,"Tej!","Furious 7"
"580",2572445,2573784,"I hate you, Tej!","Furious 7"
"581",2577137,2578137,"Get ready!","Furious 7"
"582",2578146,2579659,"Ground's coming fast!","Furious 7"
"583",2587514,2588755,"C'mon, baby.","Furious 7"
"584",2588860,2590018,"Come on.","Furious 7"
"585",2637889,2639130,"Touchdown, baby!","Furious 7"
"586",2643661,2645030,"Car check. Call it in.","Furious 7"
"587",2645106,2646286,"- Check. - Check.","Furious 7"
"588",2646288,2647347,"I'm good, let's do this.","Furious 7"
"589",2650413,2651898,"Hello? Please man!","Furious 7"
"590",2652014,2653735,"Get me outta here, somebody!","Furious 7"
"591",2653838,2655097,"No! The trees!","Furious 7"
"592",2655804,2656804,"Shit.","Furious 7"
"593",2656829,2658688,"Sit tight, Roman. We'll come back for you.","Furious 7"
"594",2658771,2660047,"This is not the plan!","Furious 7"
"595",2665489,2668860,"CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS, AZERBAIJAN","Furious 7"
"596",2680449,2681449,"All right.","Furious 7"
"597",2681451,2682902,"You got one chance to hit them here, Dom.","Furious 7"
"598",2683010,2684563,"You miss, they'll make it to their black site...","Furious 7"
"599",2684715,2687177,"they'll squeeze whatever information they need out of Ramsey.","Furious 7"
"600",2687309,2690079,"The device and your chance of ever getting Shaw will be gone for good.","Furious 7"
"601",2690188,2691210,"That ain't gonna happen.","Furious 7"
"602",2691905,2692905,"I'll see you at the pickup.","Furious 7"
"603",2698295,2699574,"Ramsey, will be in the bus.","Furious 7"
"604",2699623,2700623,"Then let's do this.","Furious 7"
"605",2710264,2712197,"Captain we have company. Four cars inbound.","Furious 7"
"606",2712233,2714275,"What, no!","Furious 7"
"607",2739643,2741018,"- Tej, shoot it! - I'm on the way!","Furious 7"
"608",2746041,2747159,"All right, formation!","Furious 7"
"609",2753925,2755114,"Bulletproof, baby.","Furious 7"
"610",2761063,2762063,"Punch it!","Furious 7"
"611",2786806,2787806,"Strike!","Furious 7"
"612",2798242,2799340,"Guns, free.","Furious 7"
"613",2800168,2801168,"Yes, sir.","Furious 7"
"614",2804936,2805936,"No!","Furious 7"
"615",2809137,2810137,"Shit!","Furious 7"
"616",2810418,2811418,"Get out of the way!","Furious 7"
"617",2824617,2826534,"Those aren't guns, those are goddamn cannons!","Furious 7"
"618",2826644,2827835,"Armor piercing rounds!","Furious 7"
"619",2852023,2853023,"Hook 'em up.","Furious 7"
"620",2859942,2861445,"Brian, Tej, blow it!","Furious 7"
"621",2870425,2871425,"Lock it up.","Furious 7"
"622",2882371,2883938,"Brian, you're up!","Furious 7"
"623",2902436,2903945,"Little closer, Tej!","Furious 7"
"624",2939094,2940278,"Ramsey?","Furious 7"
"625",2940385,2941751,"Stay away from me! Stay back!","Furious 7"
"626",2941865,2943090,"Don't you touch me!","Furious 7"
"627",2943197,2944942,"My name's Brian, and I'm gonna get you out of here...","Furious 7"
"628",2944943,2946197,"but I'm gonna need you to settle down, all right?","Furious 7"
"629",2946273,2947570,"I'm gonna cut those things off of you.","Furious 7"
"630",2963275,2964275,"Sir?","Furious 7"
"631",2965320,2967304,"Sir, we have an unidentified vehicle approaching.","Furious 7"
"632",2969416,2970869,"Come on! Closer!","Furious 7"
"633",2970990,2972302,"You have to jump!","Furious 7"
"634",2972375,2973594,"We're out of time. Come on.","Furious 7"
"635",2973672,2974952,"We gotta get out of here!","Furious 7"
"636",2975608,2976608,"Come on!","Furious 7"
"637",2977001,2978001,"Look at me!","Furious 7"
"638",2978025,2980246,"If you don't jump, we're gonna die! Okay?","Furious 7"
"639",2980998,2982360,"You're jumping. Come on!","Furious 7"
"640",2982474,2983474,"One.","Furious 7"
"641",2983862,2984862,"Two!","Furious 7"
"642",2993532,2995150,"Well, well, well.","Furious 7"
"643",3001739,3002739,"Take my hand!","Furious 7"
"644",3018195,3020597,"Welcome to the party, Mr. Shaw.","Furious 7"
"645",3069831,3071592,"Letty, stay with Brian.","Furious 7"
"646",3096300,3097300,"Oh shit!","Furious 7"
"647",3101550,3103364,"What are you doing? This is crazy!","Furious 7"
"648",3103481,3104740,"Keeping you alive!","Furious 7"
"649",3150068,3151068,"There's a cliff.","Furious 7"
"650",3151429,3153119,"Cliff! cliff!","Furious 7"
"651",3194494,3195494,"No!","Furious 7"
"652",3245476,3246476,"Too slow!","Furious 7"
"653",3289286,3290807,"Yeah!","Furious 7"
"654",3293690,3294690,"I'm back, bitches!","Furious 7"
"655",3386929,3387929,"You good?","Furious 7"
"656",3387976,3389181,"Thank you.","Furious 7"
"657",3406452,3407822,"Roman! Get back to the others.","Furious 7"
"658",3407931,3408447,"What about you?","Furious 7"
"659",3408599,3409914,"Don't worry about me.","Furious 7"
"660",3467893,3470519,"I have to say, I am impressed.","Furious 7"
"661",3471047,3473905,"I would very much like to know the name...","Furious 7"
"662",3474018,3477478,"of the man who is causing me so much trouble.","Furious 7"
"663",3478518,3479974,"There is no way out of there.","Furious 7"
"664",3480809,3481963,"What is he doing?","Furious 7"
"665",3482041,3483938,"He's frozen like a damn deer on headlights.","Furious 7"

"1044",5309087,5312002,"You didn't really think I was gonna walk in there naked, did you?","Furious 7"
"1045",5314242,5315470,"You got hit bad.","Furious 7"
"1046",5316155,5317528,"Look. Toretto.","Furious 7"
"1047",5318645,5320372,"I know you won't listen to me.","Furious 7"
"1048",5321061,5323360,"You're not gonna wanna hear what I have to say.","Furious 7"
"1049",5324123,5325525,"But the truth is...","Furious 7"
"1050",5326215,5327658,"you really ought to...","Furious 7"
"1051",5329042,5330659,"try that Belgian ale, man.","Furious 7"
"1052",5331737,5332930,"It's something special.","Furious 7"
"1053",5333757,5334877,"Belgian ale, huh?","Furious 7"
"1054",5338511,5339890,"We gotta get you to a hospital.","Furious 7"
"1055",5339970,5340970,"No, you're not.","Furious 7"
"1056",5341207,5342889,"I carry my own health insurance.","Furious 7"
"1057",5343001,5348590,"SOCOM Medics on standby. They're already inbound.","Furious 7"
"1058",5350213,5351288,"Pull over, kid.","Furious 7"
"1059",5366011,5368149,"Dom, you got to protect Ramsey.","Furious 7"
"1060",5368297,5369846,"As long as she's alive,","Furious 7"
"1061",5371408,5373501,"she can lock them out of God's Eye and they know that.","Furious 7"
"1062",5373573,5376389,"That means, they're not gonna stop coming until they've got her.","Furious 7"
"1063",5377229,5378677,"And this time when they come...","Furious 7"
"1064",5378789,5380841,"They're gonna come with everything they've got.","Furious 7"
"1065",5381750,5382750,"I'm not leaving you.","Furious 7"
"1066",5382862,5383917,"You're not.","Furious 7"
"1067",5384645,5385867,"I'm leaving you.","Furious 7"
"1068",5389047,5390292,"Go now, Dom.","Furious 7"
"1069",5404673,5407387,"A war is coming to us whether we like it or not.","Furious 7"
"1070",5408509,5409793,"But if a war's coming...","Furious 7"
"1071",5412561,5414725,"We're gonna face them on the streets we know best.","Furious 7"
"1072",5420585,5423168,"I'm all for winging it, but this is crazy, man.","Furious 7"
"1073",5423686,5426224,"We got mercenaries with some real heat on us.","Furious 7"
"1074",5427591,5429046,"I mean I ain't scared of nothing but...","Furious 7"
"1075",5429148,5430641,"..I don't even have a gun.","Furious 7"
"1076",5431966,5432966,"Gun?","Furious 7"
"1077",5435180,5436697,"We got a whole city.","Furious 7"
"1078",5436809,5438260,"And we may have more than that.","Furious 7"
"1079",5438367,5439555,"If they use God's Eye...","Furious 7"
"1080",5439664,5441865,"it will tap the cameras around to find our location.","Furious 7"
"1081",5441934,5443809,"Which means we could plant a virus.","Furious 7"
"1082",5444458,5446115,"And then break in when they access it.","Furious 7"
"1083",5446813,5449255,"So you're talking about hacking my hacking device.","Furious 7"
"1084",5449369,5450454,"That's brilliant.","Furious 7"
"1085",5451180,5452729,"Yeah, but there's one problem.","Furious 7"
"1086",5452837,5453850,"The signal strength.","Furious 7"
"1087",5453962,5457319,"We can't start a hack on them until they're within a two mile range.","Furious 7"
"1088",5457430,5459122,"- That's really close. - Close?","Furious 7"
"1089",5459265,5460463,"These guys are military.","Furious 7"
"1090",5460590,5463270,"If they're within two miles of us, we already dead.","Furious 7"
"1091",5463378,5467632,"I don't know about y'all, but I didn't really plan on dying today.","Furious 7"
"1092",5467744,5469646,"Only one way to stay alive.","Furious 7"
"1093",5470452,5472324,"We play keepaway with Ramsey.","Furious 7"
"1094",5472434,5473154,"What?","Furious 7"
"1095",5473268,5474914,"They can't hit us if we keep moving.","Furious 7"
"1096",5474992,5476224,"And I'll take Shaw.","Furious 7"
"1097",5476755,5479953,"So basically we're just gearing up for a big game of hot potato, huh?","Furious 7"
"1098",5482298,5484650,"Why does it feel like I'm not gonna see you again?","Furious 7"
"1099",5498203,5499640,"I'll come back for that.","Furious 7"
"1100",5501398,5502398,"Promise?","Furious 7"

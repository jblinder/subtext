"1201",4874411,4876996,"I was thinking that you want to get awayfrom your wife.","Lolita"
"1202",4877162,4880875,"I don't blame you. If I was marriedI'd take every opportunity to get away.","Lolita"

"1204",4883545,4887381,"Uh, as a matter of fact, it's possiblethat my wife won't join me...","Lolita"
"1205",4887548,4889966,"...because when I left homeshe was not well.","Lolita"
"1206",4890260,4892011,"Aw, gee. What was the matterwith your wife?","Lolita"
"1207",4892177,4894262,"It's not important. She had an accident.","Lolita"

"1209",4898894,4901604,"...an accident like that!What happened to her?","Lolita"
"1210",4901813,4903271,"She was hit by a car.","Lolita"
"1211",4903439,4906774,"Gee, no wonder she's not here.You must feel pretty bad about that.","Lolita"

"1221",4933636,4935720,"He's a really normal, nice sort of guy...","Lolita"
"1222",4935889,4938181,"...and I've only got to havea word in his ear...","Lolita"
"1223",4938350,4940809,"...and you'd be surprisedwhat things could happen.","Lolita"
"1224",4940976,4944313,"He'd probably turn some troopers out,so you could have a lovely room...","Lolita"
"1225",4944480,4946689,"...a bridal suite,for you and your lovely girl.","Lolita"
"1226",4946858,4949193,"I don't want you to take any troubleon my account.","Lolita"

"1229",4953698,4955532,"He gets paid for doing that thing...","Lolita"
"1230",4955699,4957993,"...and when he sees a guy like you,all normal...","Lolita"
"1231",4958161,4960371,"...with a lovely girl,he should say to himself:","Lolita"
"1232",4960537,4964332,"""I gotta give that guy a lovely sort ofcomfortable, foamy bed to sleep in.""","Lolita"
"1233",4964501,4968545,"I don't like to hear things like that,because I could go take a swipe at him...","Lolita"

"1235",4972341,4973801,"You know what I mean? Heh.","Lolita"

"1244",4998493,5001662,"...me being a policeman,I'd think you were sort of suspicious?","Lolita"

"1529",6316225,6318560,"-The facts...?-The facts of life.","Lolita"
"1530",6318729,6321021,"You see, Lolita is a sweet little child...","Lolita"
"1531",6321189,6323940,"...but the onset of maturity seemsto be giving her...","Lolita"
"1532",6324109,6326359,"...a certain amount of trouble.","Lolita"
"1533",6327654,6330405,"I really don't think that this is a fit topic.","Lolita"
"1534",6331073,6336828,"Well, Dr. Humbert, to you she is stillthe little girl what is cradled in the arms...","Lolita"
"1535",6337163,6340623,"...but to those boys over thereat the Beardsley High...","Lolita"
"1536",6341710,6344086,"...she is a lovely girl, you know...","Lolita"
"1537",6344546,6346713,"...with the swing, you know, the jazz...","Lolita"
"1538",6346881,6350467,"...and she has got the curvatureswhich they take a lot of notice of.","Lolita"
"1539",6350635,6352261,"You and I, what are we?","Lolita"
"1540",6352429,6354930,"We are symbols of power,sitting in our offices.","Lolita"
"1541",6355097,6357766,"We are making the signatures,writing the contracts...","Lolita"
"1542",6357934,6359935,"...and decisions all the time.","Lolita"
"1543",6360103,6361770,"But if we cast our minds back....","Lolita"
"1544",6361938,6364564,"Just think, what were we only yesterday?","Lolita"
"1545",6364733,6366859,"Yesterday, Dr. Humbert...","Lolita"
"1546",6367027,6369487,"...you and I were little High School Jim...","Lolita"
"1547",6369654,6372238,"...and we were carryingHigh School Jane's schoolbooks.","Lolita"
"1548",6372407,6374367,"You remember those days?","Lolita"
"1549",6375493,6380413,"In point of fact, uh, Dr. Zemph,I am a lecturer in French literature.","Lolita"
"1550",6381582,6386628,"I have not made my point quite clear.","Lolita"
"1551",6388006,6392134,"I have some other details whichI would like to put to you, Dr. Humbert.","Lolita"
"1552",6393595,6397972,"Here. ""She is defiant and rude.Sighs a good deal in the class.""","Lolita"
"1553",6398140,6399350,"She sighs, makes the sound of:","Lolita"
"1554",6400726,6403895,"""Chews gum vehemently.""All the time she is chewing this gum.","Lolita"
"1555",6404064,6405314,"""Handles books gracefully.""","Lolita"
"1556",6405481,6407733,"That doesn't really matter.""Voice is pleasant.","Lolita"
"1557",6407900,6411112,"Giggles rather often and is excitable.""She giggles at things.","Lolita"
"1558",6411279,6413823,"""A little dreamy. Concentration is poor.""","Lolita"
"1559",6413989,6417243,"She looks at the book for a whileand then she gets fed up with it.","Lolita"
"1560",6417411,6418868,"""Has private jokes of her own.""","Lolita"
"1561",6419037,6421956,"Which no one understandsso they can't enjoy them with her.","Lolita"
"1562",6422123,6425501,"""She either has exceptional controlor she has no control at all.""","Lolita"
"1563",6425668,6427336,"We cannot decide which.","Lolita"
"1564",6427796,6431841,"Added to that, just yesterday,uh, Dr. Humbert...","Lolita"
"1565",6432091,6436554,"...she wrote a most obscene wordwith the lipstick, if you please...","Lolita"
"1566",6436720,6438389,"...on the health pamphlet.","Lolita"
"1567",6439265,6444895,"And so, in our opinion, she is sufferingfrom acute repression of the libido...","Lolita"
"1568",6445104,6447273,"...of the natural instincts.","Lolita"
"1569",6449275,6451652,"I fail to see the significance of all this...","Lolita"
"1570",6451819,6455780,"...as far as her record as a studentis concerned, Dr. Zemph.","Lolita"
"1571",6456615,6458033,"We Americans...","Lolita"
"1572",6458868,6460869,"...we are progressively modern.","Lolita"
"1573",6461912,6466792,"We believe that it is equally importantto prepare the pupils...","Lolita"
"1574",6467168,6471212,"...for the mutually satisfactory matingand the successful child rearing.","Lolita"
"1575",6471381,6474091,"-That is what we believe.-What do you suggest?","Lolita"
"1576",6474384,6476010,"I am suggesting...","Lolita"
"1577",6476511,6481140,"...that Dr. Cudler, who is the districtpsychologist to the Board of Education...","Lolita"
"1578",6481475,6485478,"...should visit you in the home withhis three-member board of psychologists...","Lolita"
"1579",6485645,6489189,"...and once they are in the homethey can investigate thoroughly...","Lolita"
"1580",6489356,6492984,"...in the home situation,with all four of them.","Lolita"
"1581",6495154,6499033,"Mm. The--? The home situation?","Lolita"
"1582",6499201,6503037,"So that they can get straightat the source of the repression.","Lolita"
"1583",6503204,6505956,"But she's not being repressed,Dr. Zemph.","Lolita"
"1584",6506500,6510418,"Do I take it then that, uh,you are refusing to cooperate...","Lolita"
"1585",6510587,6513130,"...with Dr. Cudlerand those men what he's got?","Lolita"
"1586",6513297,6516634,"I am not refusing anything at all,but please understand me.","Lolita"
"1587",6516801,6519094,"-No, I don't want to---What are you saying then?","Lolita"
"1588",6519720,6521680,"I absolutely refuse...","Lolita"
"1589",6521890,6525518,"...to have a quartetof strange psychologists...","Lolita"
"1590",6525685,6527810,"...nosing around my house.","Lolita"
"1591",6529189,6530689,"Dr. Humbert...","Lolita"
"1592",6531690,6533359,"...I'm afraid that...","Lolita"
"1593",6534069,6536028,"...uh, you may have no choice.","Lolita"
"1594",6536529,6537988,"Cigarette?","Lolita"
"1595",6538155,6540573,"-No choice?-No choice.","Lolita"
"1596",6541701,6542952,"Keep the pack.","Lolita"
"1597",6544371,6547206,"Look, Dr. Humbert...","Lolita"
"1598",6547373,6550417,"...I don't wish to take thisto a higher level of authority...","Lolita"
"1599",6550585,6553587,"-...if I can possibly help it. Understand?-I should hope not.","Lolita"
"1600",6553755,6555965,"So you must help me.","Lolita"
"1601",6559386,6560636,"What can I do?","Lolita"
"1602",6560929,6564472,"I don't know, but perhaps there isanother approach that we can take...","Lolita"
"1603",6564640,6568851,"...something new altogether,some new approach. What would you say?","Lolita"
"1604",6569020,6570145,"Would you like that?","Lolita"
"1605",6570313,6575234,"Some new area of adjustmentthat Lolita could find...","Lolita"
"1606",6575402,6579738,"...perhaps by taking a larger shareof the extracurricular school activities?","Lolita"
"1607",6579989,6583867,"I have never objected to her taking partin the extracurricular....","Lolita"
"1608",6585453,6587121,"-School activities.-Pardon me.","Lolita"
"1609",6587288,6590039,"You see, we have questioned Lolitaon the home situation...","Lolita"
"1610",6590207,6593002,"...but she says not a word,stays with her lips buttoned up.","Lolita"
"1611",6593168,6596296,"So we are speaking with her friends,and they are saying things...","Lolita"
"1612",6596463,6599007,"...which I wouldn't repeat to you here.","Lolita"
"1613",6599175,6603011,"But there is one thing which has arisenfrom this which is quite clear:","Lolita"
"1614",6603179,6607056,"That you, Dr. Humbert,should definitely un-veto...","Lolita"
"1615",6607225,6610978,"...that girl's nonparticipationin the school play.","Lolita"
"1616",6615524,6619444,"Perhaps I was wrong in the attitudethat I took about the school play.","Lolita"
"1617",6619613,6622323,"That's very big of you to admit that.While you're at it...","Lolita"
"1618",6622489,6625492,"...why don't you also loosen upa bit more on the other two D's...","Lolita"
"1619",6625659,6627828,"...the ""dating"" and the ""dance""?","Lolita"
"1620",6628787,6630913,"Do you think that those areequally important?","Lolita"
"1621",6631082,6632957,"Dr. Humbert, I tell you what I do think.","Lolita"
"1622",6633126,6637587,"I feel that you and I should do allin our power to stop that old Dr. Cudler...","Lolita"
"1623",6637756,6640548,"...and his quartet of psychologistsfrom fiddling around...","Lolita"
"1624",6640716,6643217,"...in the home situation.That's what I feel.","Lolita"
"1625",6644220,6646180,"Don't you agree with me?","Lolita"
"1626",6654648,6658817,"I stand before you,a rearsome bucky goat no more.","Lolita"
"1627",6658984,6660860,"Tremble not, little nymph.","Lolita"
"1628",6661029,6663738,"You see before you a weary goat.","Lolita"
"1629",6664658,6666742,"The bewitcher is bewitched.","Lolita"
"1630",6667452,6668827,"Look, Semiramis, look!","Lolita"
"1631",6668994,6670912,"Yes, the goat removeth his horns.","Lolita"
"1632",6671081,6673873,"-Let us take him to the Dark Kingdom.-Yes.","Lolita"
"1633",6674042,6675751,"To the Dark Kingdom, away, away!","Lolita"
"1634",6688097,6690015,"Why, good evening, Dr. Humbert.","Lolita"
"1635",6690182,6691391,"Miss Starch! Good evening!","Lolita"
"1636",6691559,6695270,"-Did you enjoy the performance?-Very much. I enjoyed every minute of it.","Lolita"
"1637",6695438,6698273,"I wondered if the symbolismwasn't heavy-handed at times.","Lolita"
"1638",6698440,6701944,"I know what you mean,but weren't the boys and girls charming?","Lolita"
"1639",6702112,6705113,"They were, weren't they?And particularly little Lolita.","Lolita"
"1640",6705280,6708117,"She was quite perfect.You must be awfully proud of her.","Lolita"
"1641",6708283,6711744,"Yes, I am. You know, her performancetook me completely by surprise.","Lolita"
"1642",6711912,6714456,"She made me promise not to watchany of the rehearsals.","Lolita"
"1643",6714623,6716417,"They're so intense at that age.","Lolita"
"1644",6716583,6718377,"She must have worked awfully hard.","Lolita"
"1645",6718545,6720921,"No wonder you decidedto suspend her piano lessons.","Lolita"
"1646",6721088,6722338,"After all, there are only--","Lolita"
"1647",6722506,6725300,"I beg your pardon, did you say,""suspend her piano lessons""?","Lolita"
"1648",6725467,6726551,"Yes.","Lolita"
"1649",6726720,6729387,"-Do you play, Dr. Humbert?-Well, hardly at all now.","Lolita"
"1650",6729555,6731765,"Didn't she have a lesson with youlast Saturday?","Lolita"
"1651",6731932,6734350,"-No.-Nor the preceding Saturday?","Lolita"
"1652",6734519,6736811,"No. She called to sayshe was busy rehearsing.","Lolita"
"1653",6736979,6738271,"Busy rehearsing?","Lolita"
"1654",6738439,6741567,"As a matter of fact,she hasn't had a lesson for...","Lolita"
"1655",6741775,6743819,"...let me see, four weeks.","Lolita"
"1656",6744445,6746279,"I hope I haven't spoken out of turn.","Lolita"
"1657",6746448,6749449,"No, no, not at all.I must have misunderstood, that's all.","Lolita"
"1658",6750118,6753619,"By the way, Dr. Humbert,there's so few people in Beardsley...","Lolita"
"1659",6753787,6756414,"...who appreciate music,I was wondering, sometime...","Lolita"
"1660",6756582,6759501,"...if you'd like to come byand I could play something for you.","Lolita"
"1661",6759668,6763337,"Yes, of course, certainly I will.Thank you. Excuse me now.","Lolita"

"1721",6962579,6964331,"It's partly my fault. I realize that.","Lolita"
"1722",6964498,6967792,"It's something that's happenedon account of this horrible place.","Lolita"
"1723",6967961,6970378,"These people poking their nosesinto our business...","Lolita"
"1724",6970546,6973547,"...and I never see you anymore,with your soda fountains, and your extra--","Lolita"
"1725",6974926,6976342,"Stop doing that!","Lolita"
"1726",6985269,6987645,"But we could leave this place perhaps.","Lolita"

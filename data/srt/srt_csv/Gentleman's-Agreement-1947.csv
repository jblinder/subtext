"686",3358900,3362200,"- Won't we have to let Jane in on it?- I hadn't thought.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"687",3362300,3365900,"I hadn't either, until now.But won't we? Your mother knows.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"688",3366000,3369600,"She had to. Jane and her husband don't.If you wanna keep a secret...","Gentleman's Agreement"

"711",3475200,3478500,"Professor, two people wanna meet you,but are scared.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"712",3478500,3482800,"They'll introduce themselves. That'llmake them talk. You're on your own, kids.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"713",3482900,3486200,"- Fine friend!- Come on, Fred. I want them to be alone.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"714",3486300,3489100,"- This is my fianc�e, Kathy Lacey.- How do you do?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"715",3489100,3494300,"I'm Phil Green. John Minifyhas been wanting to get us together.
Oh, yes, yes...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"716",3494400,3497100,"- Yes! He told me he did.- How do you do?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"717",3497100,3500600,"- I'm doing a series for him on anti-Semitism.- For or against?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"718",3500800,3503900,"Well, he thought thatwe might hash over some ideas.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"719",3504000,3507100,"- What sort of ideas?- Palestine. For instance, Zionism.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"720",3507200,3512500,"Which? Palestine as a refuge or Zionismas a movement for a Jewish state?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"721",3512600,3516700,"- The confusion between the two.- If we agree there's confusion, we can talk.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"722",3516800,3522100,"We scientists love confusion. But right nowI'm starting on a new crusade of my own.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"723",3522100,3525800,"You see, I have no religion,so I'm not Jewish by religion.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"724",3525800,3530300,"Further, I'm a scientist, so I must rely onscience that tells me I'm not Jewish by race...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"725",3530400,3536000,"...since there's no such thing as a distinctJewish race. There's not even a Jewish type.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"726",3536100,3542100,"Well, my crusade will have a certain charm.I will simply go forth and state I'm not a Jew.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"727",3542200,3547300,"With my face, that becomes not an evasion,but a new principle. A scientific principle.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"728",3547300,3549500,"- For a scientific age.- Precisely.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"729",3549800,3554500,"There must be millions of people nowadayswho are religious only in the vaguest sense.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"730",3554600,3560700,"I've often wondered why the Jewish onesamong them still call themselves Jews.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"731",3560800,3564000,"- Can you guess why, Mr Green?- No, but I'd like to know.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"732",3564100,3568600,"Because the world still makes itan advantage not to be one.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"733",3568700,3573300,"Thus, for many of us, it becomes a matterof pride to go on calling ourselves Jews.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"734",3573400,3577800,"So, you see, I will have to abandonmy crusade before it begins.","Gentleman's Agreement"

"1368",6540300,6543100,"- But Phil actually...- What kind of story, Kathy?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1369",6543200,6547100,"- Just a story. It had nothing to...- Suppose you tell me anyway.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1370",6547200,6551500,"Well, it was just a vulgar little joke.It has nothing to do with this.","Gentleman's Agreement"

I can take naughty words, you know.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1372",6557000,6558900,"But why?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1373",6559000,6562300,"Oh, all right. It was a man named Lockhardt...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1374",6562300,6566600,"...and he tried to get laughs with wordslike ""kike"" and ""coon"", and...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1375",6566600,6571600,"...I despised him and everybody else there.- What did you do? When he told the joke?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1376",6571700,6573500,"What do you mean?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1377",6573600,6576600,"I mean... what did you say when he finished?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1378",6577000,6579400,"I wanted to yell at him and get up and leave.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1379",6579500,6583400,"I wanted to say to everyone at that table:Why do we sit here and take it...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1380",6583500,6587500,"...when he's attacking everythingwe believe in? Why don't we call him on it?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1381",6587600,6592100,"- And what did you do?- I just sat there. I felt ashamed.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1382",6592100,6594200,"We all just sat there.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1383",6595700,6597300,"Yeah.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1384",6597400,6601000,"And then you left and got me on the phone.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1385",6601200,6606000,"Later, after dinner was over, I saidI was ill and I am. I'm sick through.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1386",6606100,6611500,"I wonder if you'd feel so sick now,Kathy, if you {y:i}had nailed him.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1387",6611600,6615000,"There's a funny kind of elationabout socking back.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1388",6616200,6618500,"I learned that a long time ago.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1389",6619400,6623100,"- Phil's learned it.- And I haven't?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1390",6623200,6628700,"Lots of things are pretty rough, Kathy.This is just a different kind of a war.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1391",6630800,6635700,"- And anybody who crawls away is a quitter...- I didn't say that.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1392",6636200,6638200,"You did.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1393",6638700,6643000,"Somebody told a story. Sure,a man at a dinner table told the story...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1394",6643100,6648900,"...and the nice people didn't laugh.They even despised him for it.
But they let it pass.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1395",6649200,6653500,"And behind thatjoke is Flume Innand Darien and Tommy and those kids...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1396",6653500,6657000,"And if you don't stopwith thatjoke, where do you stop?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1397",6659700,6662900,"- Is that what you mean?- That's right.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1398",6662900,6665000,"Where do you call a halt?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1399",6666300,6669400,"I got mad at Phil becausehe expected me to fight this...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1400",6669400,6673500,"...instead of getting mad at the peoplewho help it along, like Lockhardt.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1401",6673600,6677100,"Not just old Lockhardt.At least he's out in the open.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1402",6677100,6681200,"But what about the other dinner guests?They're supposed to be on your side.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1403",6681300,6685300,"- And they didn't act or...- No, they didn't. And I didn't.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1404",6685300,6687800,"That's the trouble: We never do.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1405",6692300,6694400,"It all links up, Dave.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1406",6695900,6699800,"Phil will fight. He can fight.He always will fight.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1407",6701200,6709300,"And if I just sit by and... feel sick,then I'm not a fit wife for him.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1408",6712100,6716400,"It was always on those deeper issuesthat we had our quarrels.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1409",6716500,6718600,"Always.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1410",6718700,6721800,"- And I never knew it until now.- Sure.","Gentleman's Agreement"

"1412",6732100,6734800,"More than his beloved girl.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1413",6734900,6737700,"More than even the mother of his children.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1414",6737700,6743300,"He wants a sidekick, a buddy,to go through the rough spots with...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1415",6743300,6749000,"...and she has to feel thatthe same things are the rough spots...","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1416",6749100,6752800,"...or they're always out of line with each other.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1417",6752900,6755700,"You're not cast in bronze, sweetie.","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1418",6755800,6759400,"You're nice and soft and pliable...","Gentleman's Agreement"

"1421",6773300,6775200,"Can I?","Gentleman's Agreement"
"1422",6779500,6782200,"But it's got to be more than talk.","Gentleman's Agreement"

"1055",3169458,3171253,"We dealt directlywith the Church.","Spotlight"
"1056",3172753,3176257,"We would draw up a demand letterand send it to the chancery.","Spotlight"
"1057",3177717,3179344,"You never filedanything in court?","Spotlight"
"1058",3179635,3181221,"It's a private mediation.","Spotlight"

"1060",3186768,3187893,"in a room?","Spotlight"
"1061",3188603,3189603,"Correct.","Spotlight"
"1062",3190271,3191273,"Anyone else?","Spotlight"

"1072",3210958,3212543,"Jeez, it's a freakin' racket.","Spotlight"
"1073",3212626,3214128,"It's more complicated than that.","Spotlight"
"1074",3214253,3217090,"Macleish's got a duty to the clientto get the best deal he can.","Spotlight"
"1075",3217257,3220175,"Sure, but how many victims doyou represent and profit from","Spotlight"
"1076",3220302,3221385,"before you say something?","Spotlight"
"1077",3221469,3223512,"Garabedian would say none.","Spotlight"
"1078",3223597,3225472,"That's why he's takingthese cases to court","Spotlight"
"1079",3225556,3227266,"because he wants peopleto know about this.","Spotlight"
"1080",3227349,3230061,"I agree.And legal ethics aside, Ben,","Spotlight"
"1081",3230228,3232188,"I mean, operatingthe way Macleish has","Spotlight"
"1082",3232355,3234565,"all but guarantees that theabuse stays under wraps.","Spotlight"
"1083",3235692,3238695,"Yeah. Did Macleish confirmall Saviano's priests?","Spotlight"
"1084",3238987,3243324,"No. He's limited by hisconfidentiality agreement.","Spotlight"
"1085",3244159,3246577,"But clearly he's settled casesagainst a number of them.","Spotlight"
"1086",3246661,3248329,"Phil's put me in touch withsome of the other victims,","Spotlight"
"1087",3248413,3251166,"I'm pretty confident all of hispriests are gonna check out.","Spotlight"

"155",2441315,2443106,"to get firewood.","The Gold Rush"
"156",2480103,2484315,"And in that cabin his secretwas revealed... his love for Georgia.","The Gold Rush"
"157",2484483,2486358,"And the girls giggled and laughed...","The Gold Rush"
"158",2486485,2488652,"perhaps in order to hide their pity...","The Gold Rush"
"159",2488778,2490822,"for in the world of thedance hall, it wasn't","The Gold Rush"

"163",2504418,2506836,"their faces alight with mischief...","The Gold Rush"
"164",2507005,2510340,"but all the while,his heart was singing.","The Gold Rush"

"217",3354476,3356686,"How dare that cadmention her name so lightly?","The Gold Rush"
"218",3356811,3358938,"For two pins he would give himanother thrashing.","The Gold Rush"
"219",3359065,3362775,"However, at that moment, being a littleunderweight, he would ignore the insult.","The Gold Rush"
"220",3376414,3378833,"But it was true.Georgia had been looking for him.","The Gold Rush"
"221",3378960,3381043,"Georgia had written him a letter.","The Gold Rush"

"240",3530860,3533822,"""My, this is a heavy lamb chop,""said the Little Fellow.","The Gold Rush"
"241",3597344,3599929,"Then Fate - it's always Fate -played its little joke...","The Gold Rush"
"242",3600054,3602766,"and again the elements laughed,roared, and thundered...","The Gold Rush"
"243",3602891,3605893,"but through it allour heroes soundly slumbered.","The Gold Rush"
"244",3626456,3628458,"Then came the dawn.","The Gold Rush"
"245",3635632,3637322,"The Little Fellow awoke,blissfully ignorant","The Gold Rush"

"273",4013635,4016137,"""We shall be millionaires!""","The Gold Rush"
"274",4016804,4018389,"And so they were.","The Gold Rush"
"275",4040661,4044539,"Now they were homeward bound,leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska...","The Gold Rush"
"276",4044666,4046416,"to live in the landof milk and honey...","The Gold Rush"
"277",4046543,4049170,"to live, laugh, and indulge themselvesin the lap of luxury.","The Gold Rush"
"278",4049295,4052340,"And they were famous,and they were sought after by the press.","The Gold Rush"
"279",4059472,4062766,"In their cabin deluxe,they were welcomed and waited upon.","The Gold Rush"
"280",4082036,4084329,"And the reporter wanted to writethe Little Fellow's life story...","The Gold Rush"
"281",4084456,4087166,"from rags to riches,and he graciously consented.","The Gold Rush"
"282",4100389,4102222,"And Big Jim was manicured.","The Gold Rush"

"284",4107311,4109438,"The reporter thoughtof a good idea:","The Gold Rush"
"285",4109564,4111774,"to have the Little Fellow posein his mining clothes.","The Gold Rush"
"286",4111942,4113943,"It would make a human story.","The Gold Rush"
"287",4123119,4124453,"Georgia.","The Gold Rush"
"288",4136300,4140176,"And there she was in the steerage, neitherone knowing of the other's presence.","The Gold Rush"
"289",4140304,4143889,"And Georgia overheard the officer saythere was a stowaway aboard.","The Gold Rush"

"291",4239485,4241569,"And then she mistook himfor the stowaway.","The Gold Rush"
"292",4257587,4259712,"And the officerwas going to put him in irons...","The Gold Rush"
"293",4259840,4263050,"but Georgia pleaded for himand said she would pay his fare.","The Gold Rush"
"294",4272601,4274645,"""Heck,"" said the captain,""that's no stowaway.","The Gold Rush"
"295",4274770,4277148,"That's Big Jim's partner,the multimillionaire.""","The Gold Rush"
"296",4279443,4281777,"And of course there were apologies.","The Gold Rush"
"297",4283070,4284947,"And the Little Fellowgathered himself together...","The Gold Rush"
"298",4285073,4288117,"and James, the valet,was told to prepare for an extra guest.","The Gold Rush"
"299",4297752,4300212,"""Pardon me,"" said the reporter,""but who's the lady?""","The Gold Rush"

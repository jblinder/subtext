"317",1901943,1904612,"Firstly, I do not come seeking money.","Dark Shadows"
"318",1905071,1907281,"Rather, to provide it.","Dark Shadows"

"335",1960460,1962378,"Admired by all.","Dark Shadows"
"336",1962545,1964922,"But he believed our family was cursed...","Dark Shadows"
"337",1965089,1968593,"...and when his parents were killed,he went mad.","Dark Shadows"
"338",1968759,1973806,"Went around insisting that a witchhad turned him into a vampire.","Dark Shadows"
"339",1974724,1977059,"And what is known of his death?","Dark Shadows"
"340",1977518,1979020,"Nothing.","Dark Shadows"
"341",1979604,1981314,"Not that I can think of.","Dark Shadows"
"342",1981481,1983065,"That, madam...","Dark Shadows"
"343",1983858,1985568,"...is because he never died.","Dark Shadows"
"344",2005129,2008841,"I am Barnabas Collins.","Dark Shadows"
"345",2014263,2015431,"That means you're...","Dark Shadows"

"732",3733314,3736901,"Part of me believes he's a lonely boylooking for comfort.","Dark Shadows"
"733",3738110,3741948,"Part of me believes there are thingsin this world we don't understand.","Dark Shadows"
"734",3742114,3746869,"Things like magic, death, destiny.","Dark Shadows"
"735",3747745,3751999,"I guess as long as it makes him happy,what does it matter what anyone believes?","Dark Shadows"

"767",3882463,3884924,"That would require mercy.","Dark Shadows"
"768",3885091,3887385,"Instead, you have made me a monster.","Dark Shadows"
"769",3887551,3889303,"We're both monsters, Barnabas.","Dark Shadows"
"770",3890971,3894850,"Just two big fish in an itty-bitty pond.","Dark Shadows"

"772",3899563,3903859,"or we can make...","Dark Shadows"
"773",3906946,3908447,"...little fish together.","Dark Shadows"
"774",3911325,3915538,"I'll be honest. I was really angry at youfor the first century or so.","Dark Shadows"
"775",3916705,3920000,"Sure, it was fun...","Dark Shadows"
"776",3920418,3924130,"...watching your family squirmand burn away...","Dark Shadows"
"777",3924296,3927341,"...like ants under a magnifying glass.","Dark Shadows"
"778",3927508,3932012,"And yes, it was fun being adoredas the Collins name crumbled...","Dark Shadows"
"779",3932179,3935224,"...growing wealthy on the backsof their despair.","Dark Shadows"
"780",3935391,3937393,"But lately...","Dark Shadows"

"793",3977224,3978392,"What if I made you?","Dark Shadows"
"794",3978559,3980019,"With what, a spell?","Dark Shadows"
"795",3980186,3982646,"A little doll filled with pins?That is not love.","Dark Shadows"
"796",3983564,3986317,"- With this.- Oh.","Dark Shadows"
"797",3986650,3990321,"- The body you once begged me for.- Mmm.","Dark Shadows"

"810",4031904,4035199,"...your most intimateand womanly segments.","Dark Shadows"
"811",4094633,4098596,"That was a regrettable turn of events.","Dark Shadows"
"812",4099680,4102099,"You didn't seem to regret it.","Dark Shadows"
"813",4102266,4103309,"Yes.","Dark Shadows"
"814",4104810,4110024,"Seems that even in death,I have a weakness for the living flesh.","Dark Shadows"

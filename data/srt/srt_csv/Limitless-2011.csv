"188",832690,834679,"hoping she'd have a condom.","Limitless"
"189",834758,837316,"Somehow my unconscious had served that up.","Limitless"
"190",837392,838914,"A memory I had never even recorded.","Limitless"
"191",838993,842721,"Or was it there the whole timeand all I needed was the access?","Limitless"

"193",844995,846791,"Well, who asked you?","Limitless"
"194",846861,848828,"Hastings has his oral history, I'd start there,","Limitless"
"195",848897,850953,"Interesting point, Grammatically,this guy was an idiot,","Limitless"
"196",851029,852394,"which sort of gives credence to the theory","Limitless"
"197",852464,853452,"that one of the clerks he had fired","Limitless"
"198",853530,855690,"actually wrote most ofthis guy's major opinions,","Limitless"

"249",1172996,1174586,"OK, so what do we have here?","Limitless"
"250",1174663,1177824,"Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug","Limitless"

"275",1340553,1342644,"Vern had known whoever had done this.","Limitless"
"276",1343921,1346580,"And one guess what they'd been looking for.","Limitless"
"277",1351156,1352919,"But had they found it?","Limitless"

"308",1525750,1528944,"No, no, that's probably a good idea,","Limitless"

"319",1603978,1605875,"What would you do?","Limitless"
"320",1636113,1640273,"Vern's cash, combined with anunprecedented surge of motivation,","Limitless"
"321",1640347,1642981,"enabled me to finish the book in four days.","Limitless"
"322",1653858,1655347,"A tablet a day","Limitless"
"323",1655425,1657857,"and what I could do with my day was limitless.","Limitless"
"324",1658994,1661290,"I learned to play the piano in three days.","Limitless"
"325",1663630,1665153,"Math became useful.","Limitless"
"326",1666063,1667188,"And fun.","Limitless"
"327",1667263,1668855,"I'm all in,","Limitless"
"328",1673132,1676065,"Even half-listening to any language,I became fluent.","Limitless"

"330",1686936,1687925,"There's no arguing with you,","Limitless"
"331",1690305,1692602,"This was great.","Limitless"
"332",1692673,1695401,"So, Mom, I've been doing a littleresearch on Aunt Helen's tumor,","Limitless"
"333",1695473,1699031,"And it's totally clear that anybodywith familial adenomatous polyposis","Limitless"

"335",1701409,1702807,"with eicosapentaeonic acid,","Limitless"
"336",1702875,1705433,"I suddenly knew everything. About everything.","Limitless"
"337",1705509,1707999,"Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,but wouldn't that rapid expansion","Limitless"
"338",1708076,1709838,"devalue that stock completely in two years?","Limitless"

"341",1714913,1716436,"We're wired to overreach,","Limitless"
"342",1716513,1718741,"Look at history, all the countriesthat ever ruled the world,","Limitless"
"343",1718814,1720302,"Portugal with this big massive navy,","Limitless"
"344",1720382,1722177,"All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms,","Limitless"
"345",1722249,1723237,"And the Brits?","Limitless"
"346",1723316,1725407,"Now they're just sitting on a danklittle island fussing over their suits,","Limitless"

"351",1734353,1735818,"Yeah.","Limitless"
"352",1736520,1738214,"My brain was just pouring this stuff out.","Limitless"
"353",1738288,1741982,"Everything I had ever read, heard,seen was now organized and available.","Limitless"
"354",1742056,1744114,"Here it is. Here you go.","Limitless"
"355",1744191,1747021,"Eddie, Hey, Listen,I'm sure you have a portfolio,","Limitless"
"356",1747090,1750286,"but if you don't, I'd be veryinterested in working with you,","Limitless"
"357",1750358,1752757,"OK, Kevin,","Limitless"
"358",1753259,1755556,"I made some new friends whoinvited me to the beach.","Limitless"
"359",1756510,1758442,"The beach was not nearby.","Limitless"
"360",1770936,1773631,"All my fear, all my shyness, gone.","Limitless"
"361",1773703,1775567,"They've done four basic trials...","Limitless"
"362",1776506,1779064,"But mere lounging wasn't enough.","Limitless"
"363",1804248,1807238,"Only problem? If I wasn't moving forward,","Limitless"
"364",1807316,1809578,"I felt like I was going to explode.","Limitless"
"365",1809651,1811809,"Come up here because it's beautiful, right?","Limitless"
"366",1811884,1814749,"- Anybody ever jump?- Are you crazy?","Limitless"
"367",1819221,1821153,"- He's gonna do it,- He's not gonna do it,","Limitless"
"368",1823188,1824244,"Oh, my God!","Limitless"
"369",1836425,1837914,"Oh!","Limitless"
"370",1839626,1840786,"Ah!","Limitless"
"371",1840861,1844920,"And then I began to form an idea.","Limitless"
"372",1844996,1847427,"Suddenly, I knew exactly what I needed to do.","Limitless"
"373",1847497,1850088,"It wasn't writing. It wasn't books.","Limitless"
"374",1850163,1852188,"It was much bigger than that.","Limitless"
"375",1854965,1856829,"But it would take money to get there.","Limitless"
"376",1859800,1862393,"In a down market, no one was making much.","Limitless"
"377",1863536,1865900,"But no one had NZT.","Limitless"
"378",1865970,1867196,"In an optimistic scenario,","Limitless"
"379",1867269,1869099,"gains of that nature merely would reflect","Limitless"
"380",1869171,1872069,"growth in the economy andwould not pose an obstacle...","Limitless"
"381",1878641,1883903,"Armed with Vern's last $800,I made 2,000 in a day.","Limitless"
"382",1883976,1886307,"Next day, 7,500.","Limitless"
"383",1886376,1889775,"It was too slow. I'd need more capital.","Limitless"
"384",1890511,1892807,"But banks weren't lending to guys like me.","Limitless"
"385",1892878,1893867,"Hey, Liev,","Limitless"
"386",1893945,1896434,"That's your man in the corner back there,","Limitless"
"387",1900580,1901773,"Yeah,","Limitless"
"388",1910175,1914872,"So, uh, Liev told you that I'mlooking for a short-term loan?","Limitless"
"389",1914944,1916844,"Yeah, and I told Liev forget it,","Limitless"
"390",1917412,1918401,"Why?","Limitless"
"391",1918479,1922573,"Because I don't see you before andI don't fucking like you already,","Limitless"
"392",1922646,1925614,"Why do I give you $100,000?","Limitless"
"393",1925914,1927244,"Because...","Limitless"
"394",1929115,1932809,"... I quintupled my money four days in a row,","Limitless"
"395",1932884,1934851,"So you got a fix on the game,","Limitless"
"396",1934917,1936680,"No, not a fix,","Limitless"
"397",1936751,1939150,"I was able to calculate certainpatterns using algorithms,","Limitless"
"398",1939220,1941652,"If you look at column four,this was the first...","Limitless"
"399",1944055,1947078,"You're good,","Limitless"
"400",1949522,1950511,"OK, it's a fix,","Limitless"
"401",1951523,1953021,"Yeah, you know, all you people get caught,","Limitless"
"402",1953022,1953647,"Yeah, you know, all you people get caught,","Limitless"
"403",1953723,1954691,"What are you gonna do then?","Limitless"
"404",1956148,1958615,"Well, it's not as if I have ablack book with your name in it,","Limitless"
"405",1958682,1960479,"if that's what you're talking about,","Limitless"
"406",1960550,1962813,"And besides, I get the strong feeling","Limitless"
"407",1962884,1965750,"that you're not somebody I want to disappoint,","Limitless"
"408",1970787,1972377,"Don't get up, I said don't get up,","Limitless"
"409",1972454,1973785,"- Sit down!- Hey, OK,","Limitless"

"418",2008401,2010263,"I'd been upping the dose for over a week.","Limitless"
"419",2012535,2015126,"It seemed to cut my learning curve.","Limitless"
"420",2029575,2032405,"Why are you buying that?The CEO was just indicted,","Limitless"
"421",2032476,2035307,"But not for the big fat defensecontract he bribed his way into,","Limitless"

"501",2369713,2371442,"Well, it's a formula with a complex method,","Limitless"
"502",2371514,2373945,"But, of course, research was acomponent, Massive research,","Limitless"
"503",2374014,2377072,"I knew every helix of every scrapof DNA in every company I bought,","Limitless"

"1620",7306465,7307923,"I made a connection.","Rain Man"
"1621",7308091,7311427,"That's very admirable,but the purpose of this meeting","Rain Man"
"1622",7311595,7316765,"is to determine whether Raymond iscapable of functioning in the community,","Rain Man"
"1623",7316934,7320395,"and what he wants,if that's possible to determine.","Rain Man"
"1624",7320563,7323689,"- I'm all for that.- Raymond can't make those decisions.","Rain Man"

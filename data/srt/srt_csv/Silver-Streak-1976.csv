"447",2268397,2272333,"Oh, you're the one? I'm so pleasedto see you. Are you all right?","Silver Streak"
"448",2272401,2275165,"- Yes, I'm fine.- Oh, that's good news.","Silver Streak"
"449",2275237,2278695,"As soon as I was told,I contacted the police in Albuquerque...","Silver Streak"
"450",2278774,2282005,"and told them to spare no expenseto make sure you were safe.","Silver Streak"
"451",2282078,2285445,"Reace-- he's like a child-- got offthe train and tried to find you...","Silver Streak"
"452",2285514,2287448,"say he was sorry.","Silver Streak"
"453",2287516,2289848,"- How did you get back on?- Who's Reace?","Silver Streak"
"454",2289919,2293548,"He's the onethat threw you off.","Silver Streak"
"455",2293623,2297855,"You must remember him-- a large manwith not very attractive dental work.","Silver Streak"
"456",2297927,2300794,"I do remember,but what does he got to do with you?","Silver Streak"
"457",2300863,2303127,"He works for me.He's my chauffeur.","Silver Streak"
"458",2303199,2305690,"Not very bright,but extremely loyal.","Silver Streak"
"459",2305768,2309864,"And naturally, I assume totalresponsibility for all his actions...","Silver Streak"
"460",2309939,2312908,"and will pay for any damages.","Silver Streak"
"461",2312975,2315739,"- And what about that other fellow?- Hmm?","Silver Streak"
"462",2315811,2319907,"I met another man this morning.Does he work for you too?","Silver Streak"
"463",2319982,2323418,"Oh, yes, of course.You don't know the entire story, do you?","Silver Streak"
"464",2323486,2327980,"Early this morning, I was havingbreakfast with Professor Schreiner...","Silver Streak"
"465",2328057,2330321,"and he wanted to show mesome important papers...","Silver Streak"
"466",2330393,2332327,"connected with his book.","Silver Streak"
"467",2332395,2334727,"But, unfortunately,they were missing.","Silver Streak"
"468",2334797,2337925,"So we searchedhis compartment twice...","Silver Streak"
"469",2338000,2342835,"and eventually we discovered themin his trunk in the baggage room.","Silver Streak"
"470",2342905,2345772,"It was something of an upset,but if you know the professor...","Silver Streak"
"471",2345841,2348366,"you'll know he's slightlyabsent-minded.","Silver Streak"
"472",2348444,2350378,"Mr. Devereau, I'm very confused.","Silver Streak"
"473",2350446,2353779,"I don't understand how you could'vehad breakfast with Professor Schreiner.","Silver Streak"
"474",2353849,2356579,"George thinksthe professor's been murdered.","Silver Streak"
"475",2358821,2361551,"- Murdered?- That's right, last night.","Silver Streak"
"476",2361624,2363421,"That's extraordinary.Why should you think that?","Silver Streak"
"477",2363492,2367986,"Because I saw him fall off the roofof this train just outside this window.","Silver Streak"
"478",2368064,2371431,"- He was shot in the head.- You were in this compartment?","Silver Streak"
"479",2371500,2375061,"- I was lying right here.- Eh--","Silver Streak"
"480",2375137,2378265,"Hilly,you'll have to go back tomy compartment, straighten it out.","Silver Streak"
"481",2378340,2381707,"That man Whiney doesn't knowwhat he's doing. Devereau.","Silver Streak"
"482",2381777,2384746,"Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduceProfessor Schreiner.","Silver Streak"
"483",2384814,2388375,"- Professor Schreiner, Mr. Caldwell.- Hello.","Silver Streak"

"486",2396492,2398756,"Oh, yes.","Silver Streak"
"487",2398828,2403663,"That stupid person.I do hope you weren't hurt.","Silver Streak"
"488",2403733,2405701,"No, no.I'm all right.","Silver Streak"
"489",2405768,2407998,"I suppose I'm to blamefor this morning's fracas.","Silver Streak"
"490",2408070,2410300,"After all, none of thiswould've happened...","Silver Streak"
"491",2410372,2414035,"if I hadn't misplacedthe Rembrandt letters.","Silver Streak"
"492",2414110,2416078,"The what?","Silver Streak"
"493",2416145,2418113,"It doesn't matter.I'm so glad that you're all right...","Silver Streak"
"494",2418180,2420273,"and managed to get backon the train.","Silver Streak"
"495",2420349,2424615,"Oh, Professor? Professor,I put back as much-- I put back--","Silver Streak"
"496",2424687,2427281,"Hey, how'd you get here?","Silver Streak"
"497",2427356,2431793,"Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introducean associate of mine, Mr. Whiney.","Silver Streak"
"498",2431861,2435262,"If an apology is due, I'm surethat he'd be prepared to make it.","Silver Streak"
"499",2435331,2438232,"It's a pity that Reaceis not here to do the same.","Silver Streak"
"500",2438300,2440791,"Reace, that moron.It was all his fault.","Silver Streak"
"501",2440870,2443737,"I was looking for the papers.I never touched you, did I?","Silver Streak"
"502",2443806,2445501,"- No, no.- See?","Silver Streak"
"503",2445574,2450170,"It's been very hectic for me.I think I'll have a scotch and lie down.","Silver Streak"
"504",2450246,2452714,"Why don't you usemy compartment?","Silver Streak"
"505",2452782,2455774,"Thank you. I will.Hilly...","Silver Streak"

"507",2458120,2460816,"Mr. Caldwell,it's been nice meeting you.","Silver Streak"
"508",2460890,2464986,"I hope the rest of the trip for bothof us is a little less exhilarating.","Silver Streak"
"509",2465060,2468461,"Let's hope so.","Silver Streak"
"510",2468531,2472797,"Well, I think I've made a silly foolof myself this morning.","Silver Streak"
"511",2472868,2475769,"- No, no, not at all.- No, no, I did.","Silver Streak"
"512",2475838,2479069,"I was just sticking my nose into a lotof stuff that's none of my business...","Silver Streak"
"513",2479141,2481541,"and coming upwith some crazy ideas.","Silver Streak"
"514",2481610,2486570,"You were right. I guess I wasimagining a lot of things last night.","Silver Streak"
"515",2486649,2489243,"Probably the champagne.","Silver Streak"

"545",2613776,2616267,"I knew thatI had been drinking...","Silver Streak"
"546",2616345,2619109,"so I went to seethe professor this morning...","Silver Streak"
"547",2619181,2621911,"and I found thislittle weasel of a guy in his room.","Silver Streak"
"548",2621984,2624316,"- Edgar Whiney.- That's him.","Silver Streak"
"549",2624386,2627981,"- How did you know that?- Oh, I-I know. I just know.","Silver Streak"
"550",2628057,2629957,"Go on, go on.","Silver Streak"

"552",2635597,2638930,"picked me up andthrew me off the train.","Silver Streak"
"553",2639001,2641231,"What-- But you neversaw the professor, huh?","Silver Streak"
"554",2641303,2644761,"No, I saw him.I saw him this afternoon.","Silver Streak"
"555",2644840,2647673,"- Where?- In Hilly's compartment.","Silver Streak"
"556",2647743,2651235,"See, the man I saw last nightwas a hallucination.","Silver Streak"
"557",2652481,2654949,"- What did he look like?- Who?","Silver Streak"
"558",2655017,2657417,"The professor, you know,that you saw this afternoon.","Silver Streak"

"562",2664393,2666918,"- Did he say anything--- Nothing, nothing.","Silver Streak"
"563",2666996,2669191,"He was tiredand wanted to have a scotch.","Silver Streak"
"564",2669264,2671858,"You don't have any icein your drink.","Silver Streak"
"565",2671934,2674926,"That's it! Scotch!Listen.","Silver Streak"
"566",2675004,2678496,"See, you didn't havea hallucination.","Silver Streak"
"567",2678574,2683204,"The professor's been murdered.The guy you saw this afternoon was a fake.","Silver Streak"
"568",2683278,2685872,"- Oh, no.- Yeah. Listen.","Silver Streak"
"569",2685948,2689384,"I talked to the real professorlast night. I mean it.","Silver Streak"
"570",2689451,2692113,"He didn't wanna have anythingto do with Mr. Devereau.","Silver Streak"
"571",2692187,2694917,"Besides that, he's a health nut.Doesn't touch alcohol.","Silver Streak"
"572",2694990,2697754,"Oh, Bobby, just becauseyou're a vitamin salesman?","Silver Streak"
"573",2697826,2701057,"My name is Stevens.I'm a federal agent.","Silver Streak"
"574",2704500,2708231,"We've been working on this casefor two and a half years.","Silver Streak"
"575",2708303,2710328,"Well, what are you tailingthe professor for?","Silver Streak"
"576",2710406,2713466,"I am not tailing the professor.I'm tailing Devereau.","Silver Streak"
"577",2713542,2717478,"- Come on. Let's go.- Wait a minute. What about Hilly?","Silver Streak"
"578",2717546,2720310,"Don't worry about it. They're notgonna kill her till we get to Chicago.","Silver Streak"
"579",2720382,2723317,"I don't even think they'll tryto kill you till then. Come on.","Silver Streak"
"580",2725788,2730225,"Devereau's men must've brought theprofessor back here after 9:00 last night.","Silver Streak"
"581",2730292,2733921,"- How do you figure that?- Because I left him at 9:00...","Silver Streak"
"582",2733996,2736157,"and because this isthe easiest access to the roof.","Silver Streak"
"583",2736231,2738426,"Somehow, he must've escaped.","Silver Streak"
"584",2738500,2742231,"He got out to this ladder, then ran backdown the train before they shot him.","Silver Streak"
"585",2745841,2748571,"You're not going up there, are you?","Silver Streak"
"586",2748644,2752239,"Yeah. The Blanard Tunnel is up ahead.","Silver Streak"
"587",2752314,2755010,"Come on up andkeep a lookout, will ya?","Silver Streak"
"588",2755084,2757143,"All right, I'll try.","Silver Streak"
"589",2797358,2799292,"What did you find?","Silver Streak"
"590",2799360,2801385,"It was hooked ona protruding bolt.","Silver Streak"
"591",2804465,2807628,"Then I was right.I did see him.","Silver Streak"
"592",2819780,2822214,"I'll bet Devereauhas already got the body...","Silver Streak"
"593",2822283,2825150,"picked up and placedin cold storage someplace.","Silver Streak"
"594",2826287,2829051,"Too bad.He was a sweet old guy.","Silver Streak"
"595",2829123,2831921,"Buy why did he haveto kill the professor?","Silver Streak"
"596",2831993,2837056,"He was going to be embarrassedby the findings in the professor's book.","Silver Streak"
"597",2837131,2839224,"Two of the institute's Rembrandts...","Silver Streak"
"598",2839300,2842201,"both bought and authenticatedby Devereau...","Silver Streak"
"599",2842269,2845295,"were going to be proved forgeries.","Silver Streak"
"600",2845373,2848501,"The professor had the proofin his possession.","Silver Streak"
"601",2848576,2852979,"I asked him last night,""What was the proof?""","Silver Streak"
"602",2853047,2856949,"He told me I was goingto have to wait for his lecture.","Silver Streak"
"603",2857018,2858952,"And Devereau wasn't going to wait.","Silver Streak"
"604",2859020,2861250,"No.","Silver Streak"
"605",2861322,2864814,"I think the ideawas to kidnap the professor...","Silver Streak"
"606",2864892,2866917,"then kill him...","Silver Streak"
"607",2866994,2869485,"and then substitutesome phony look-alike...","Silver Streak"
"608",2869563,2872498,"who would botch the lectureand discredit the book.","Silver Streak"
"609",2873901,2875869,"We've gotta find the proof.","Silver Streak"
"610",2875936,2878496,"But they have the proof.They have it.","Silver Streak"
"611",2878572,2882338,"That's what Whiney and everyonewas looking for this morning--
the Rembrandt letters.","Silver Streak"
"612",2882410,2887211,"- They said that they found themin the professor's trunk.
- They're lying.","Silver Streak"
"613",2887281,2889181,"That's the first placethey would've looked...","Silver Streak"
"614",2889250,2892617,"before they started turninghis room upside down.","Silver Streak"
"615",2892686,2895416,"No! No, the professorhid them someplace...","Silver Streak"
"616",2895489,2898788,"somewhere simple, as a precautionwhen he found out
Devereau was on the train.","Silver Streak"
"617",2898859,2902989,"My God!I know where they are! Come on! Come on!","Silver Streak"
"618",2927088,2929022,"The Rembrandt letters.","Silver Streak"
"619",2931325,2934158,"Holy Toledo!I think you've found it.","Silver Streak"
"620",2936130,2939122,"This is the genuine article,penned by the old boy himself, huh?","Silver Streak"
"621",2939200,2942692,"""Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn.""","Silver Streak"
"622",2942770,2945568,"Yeah. My guess is there's a fact...","Silver Streak"
"623",2945639,2947573,"there's some kind of a datein all this that proves...","Silver Streak"
"624",2947641,2950007,"the charges the professormakes in his book.","Silver Streak"
"625",2950077,2952102,"Push the button for the porter,will ya? I wanna get the conductor...","Silver Streak"
"626",2952179,2954113,"to radio ahead to the next town.","Silver Streak"
"627",2954181,2958618,"You know, it's difficult to believethat a man was killed over those.","Silver Streak"
"628",2958686,2961416,"This is the tip of an iceberg.","Silver Streak"
"629",2961489,2963980,"You know that plane crashin Cologne, Germany last year?","Silver Streak"
"630",2964058,2968085,"That was a Devereau special.A hundred people got killed in that one.","Silver Streak"
"631",2968162,2971495,"It was just to cover up his involvementin the Metropolitan Gallery scandal.","Silver Streak"
"632",2971565,2975524,"We knew he was responsible.We couldn't pin it on him.","Silver Streak"
"633",2975603,2980700,"These letters are gonna blowhis multimillion-dollar operation
in art sky-high.","Silver Streak"
"634",2980774,2984904,"That's why she was so distant.They must've had her in a corner.","Silver Streak"
"635",2984979,2987675,"I want you to rememberthat your neck is on the line too.","Silver Streak"
"636",2987748,2990216,"You already told him you sawthe real professor shot.","Silver Streak"
"637",2990284,2992878,"Yeah, I did.","Silver Streak"
"638",2992953,2995581,"- So what do I do now?- You be responsible for Hilly.","Silver Streak"
"639",2995656,2998386,"Get her off the train and to safety.I'm gonna take care of Mr. Devereau.","Silver Streak"
"640",2998459,3002088,"- Here comes the tunnel.- We'll make our move
when the train gets to Dodge City.","Silver Streak"
"641",3002163,3004529,"- That's appropriate, huh?","Silver Streak"
"642",3004598,3007158,"Gun smoke at the O.K. Corral.","Silver Streak"
"643",3013607,3015905,"What happened?","Silver Streak"
"644",3015976,3018945,"- Bob, what happened?","Silver Streak"
"645",3019013,3021413,"Put-Put 'em back.","Silver Streak"
"646",3021482,3026078,"Go on, now. Do it.Get my gun. Take my gun.","Silver Streak"
"647",3026153,3029589,"Take my gun. Go on.Get the girl off the train, okay?","Silver Streak"
"648",3029657,3032251,"Go on!","Silver Streak"
"649",3034161,3037289,"You know, I got a funny feelingthis bullet was meant for you.","Silver Streak"
"650",3043204,3047300,"Shoot! That man's dead!","Silver Streak"
"651",3047374,3050741,"- Holy moly, you shot him!- I didn't-- No.","Silver Streak"
"652",3050811,3052379,"- No! Wait a minute!- He's been shot!","Silver Streak"
"653",3052379,3053607,"- No! Wait a minute!- He's been shot!","Silver Streak"

"1009",4921314,4925648,"I've just been looking overthis correspondence you brought me...","Silver Streak"
"1010",4925718,4928585,"and, uh, it's fascinating.","Silver Streak"
"1011",4928655,4931954,"The professor was right.It's a remarkable find.","Silver Streak"
"1012",4932025,4934459,"I'm almost temptedto destroy it...","Silver Streak"
"1013",4934527,4937690,"but then on the other hand,I've always had a soft spot...","Silver Streak"
"1014",4937764,4939789,"for things ofbeauty.","Silver Streak"
"1015",4939866,4942300,"Particularly when they were genuine.","Silver Streak"
"1016",4942368,4945030,"Whiney, would you put thesein my safe, please?","Silver Streak"
"1017",4945104,4949768,"I don't think they proposeany further threat. Do you?","Silver Streak"
"1018",4955682,4958651,"I hope you're not too disappointedif this doesn't work.","Silver Streak"
"1019",4958718,4961312,"Oh, but on the contrary,I think it will.","Silver Streak"
"1020",4961387,4964982,"This has been a very difficult project,and I have made an error or two.","Silver Streak"
"1021",4965058,4969188,"One of them was bringing that manReace out here. What happened to him?","Silver Streak"
"1022",4969262,4973528,"- I shot him.- Good for you. He probably deserved it.","Silver Streak"
"1023",4973599,4975999,"You did have him killthe professor, didn't you?","Silver Streak"
"1024",4976069,4978537,"Oh, no. Oh, no.On the contrary.","Silver Streak"
"1025",4978604,4981937,"He did that on his own.An unfortunate mistake.","Silver Streak"
"1026",4982008,4985967,"I knew we couldn't kill the professoruntil we had the Rembrandt letters.","Silver Streak"
"1027",4986045,4991506,"So I had to set up a scenario wherebythe, uh, professor was kidnapped...","Silver Streak"
"1028",4991584,4995987,"and an imposter impersonated himin order to discredit him.","Silver Streak"
"1029",4996055,5000856,"We would have killed him anyway,but his escape attempt the other
night upset the entire scheme.","Silver Streak"
"1030",5000927,5003521,"- Come in.","Silver Streak"
"1031",5003596,5006087,"Excuse me, sir.It's all confirmed.","Silver Streak"
"1032",5006165,5009157,"- The car will be waiting at Rockdale.- Good.","Silver Streak"
"1033",5009235,5011760,"Oh, Mr. Caldwell,you do remember Johnson?","Silver Streak"
"1034",5011838,5014432,"He played the partof the professor...","Silver Streak"
"1035",5014507,5018568,"and would have done the same thingat Chicago, had it been necessary.","Silver Streak"
"1036",5018644,5021670,"How long beforewe arrive at Rockdale?","Silver Streak"
"1037",5021748,5025149,"- About an hour and a half, sir.- Thank you, Johnson.","Silver Streak"
"1038",5025218,5028187,"Now all that remainsis to clear up a couple of points.","Silver Streak"
"1039",5028254,5031052,"Meaning the two of you.","Silver Streak"
"1040",5031124,5036357,"So I've arranged a new scenariowherein you are responsible
for the murder of the professor.","Silver Streak"
"1041",5036429,5040092,"- Why would I kill the professor?- To get the Rembrandt letters.","Silver Streak"
"1042",5040166,5043602,"He found out and you had to shoot himbecause he tried to blackmail you.","Silver Streak"
"1043",5043669,5046536,"Which brings usmore or less up to date.","Silver Streak"
"1044",5046606,5049973,"Except thatin about 45 minutes from now...","Silver Streak"
"1045",5050043,5053638,"the professor's trusty secretaryis going to quarrel...","Silver Streak"
"1046",5053713,5057479,"with her partner%lover...and shoot him.","Silver Streak"
"1047",5057550,5059541,"And he dies...","Silver Streak"
"1048",5059619,5062816,"but not before shooting her.","Silver Streak"
"1049",5066426,5070294,"Ah, enough of this talkof plots and scenarios.","Silver Streak"
"1050",5070363,5073423,"Uh, join me in a cupof coffee, would you?","Silver Streak"
"1051",5073499,5075933,"Coffee, mister?","Silver Streak"
"1052",5080673,5084234,"- Thanks.- The professor's book
is still gonna be published.","Silver Streak"
"1053",5084310,5087336,"Oh, yes, indeed, my dear.But without the letters...","Silver Streak"
"1054",5087413,5091179,"I'm afraid it will be regardedas the jottings of a revisionist crank.","Silver Streak"
"1055",5091250,5093184,"An ex-crank,as a matter of fact.","Silver Streak"
"1056",5093252,5096881,"The Silver Streak does have its drawbacks,but please try the marmalade.","Silver Streak"
"1057",5096956,5099823,"- They do provide an excellent cuisine.- Oh, thank you, sir.","Silver Streak"

"1059",5102895,5104123,"- Coffee, miss?- No, thanks.","Silver Streak"
"1060",5104197,5106688,"He ain't bullshittin'about the cuisine.","Silver Streak"
"1061",5106766,5110099,"- Steward?- Is that your lady, man?
She's somethin' else.","Silver Streak"
"1062",5110169,5113002,"- Steward!- Stand up, mama.
Let me get a look at you.","Silver Streak"
"1063",5113072,5116041,"- Steward!- Mm, mm, mm! Have mercy!","Silver Streak"

"1241",6217975,6222139,"Look, the engineer is probably anxiousto bring the train in on schedule.","Silver Streak"
"1242",6224148,6226616,"This is Chief Donaldson.Who's this?","Silver Streak"
"1243",6226684,6229482,"This is Jerry Jarvis.I'm the assistant controller.","Silver Streak"
"1244",6229554,6231545,"Assistant? Get me your boss.","Silver Streak"
"1245",6231622,6235752,"Uh, he's out to lunch, but I'm sureI can handle any problem you might have.","Silver Streak"
"1246",6235826,6238761,"It's not my problem.You've got a dead engineer...","Silver Streak"
"1247",6238829,6241593,"and a runaway train that'sgonna hit Chicago in 15 minutes.","Silver Streak"
"1248",6241666,6245602,"- What are you gonna do about it?- All right, I'll check
with the signal towers.","Silver Streak"
"1249",6245670,6248264,"But, uh, you see,it's impossible.","Silver Streak"
"1250",6248339,6251274,"If the engineer is dead,who's driving the train?","Silver Streak"
"1251",6261052,6263748,"- What's happening?- Hey, you all right?","Silver Streak"
"1252",6263821,6266949,"- Listen, is there any way--- Holy moley! The killer!","Silver Streak"
"1253",6267024,6269049,"- No, he's okay.- Listen to me.","Silver Streak"
"1254",6269126,6272095,"Is there any way to get to the enginewithout going over the roof?","Silver Streak"
"1255",6272163,6275758,"There ain't no way to get to the engine,period! Why are we goin' so fast?","Silver Streak"
"1256",6275833,6278063,"Because there's no onedriving this train.","Silver Streak"
"1257",6278135,6280933,"- Impossible. It would stop.- Does this look as if we're stopping?","Silver Streak"
"1258",6281005,6285339,"No, the hell it don't!I better go pull the emergency cord.","Silver Streak"
"1259",6285409,6289175,"- The emergency cords have been cut.- Damn hippies!","Silver Streak"
"1260",6291616,6295985,"I received a report from the signal towers.They see no engineer in the cabin.","Silver Streak"
"1261",6296053,6300990,"Great. Now you've got the facts.Throw one of those switches
and have the train run off.","Silver Streak"
"1262",6301058,6304926,"That's the problem.All the tracks are computer programmed.","Silver Streak"
"1263",6304996,6308124,"Switching the Silver Streak would onlycause a collision with another train.","Silver Streak"
"1264",6308199,6311862,"Then what the hell are you gonna do?There are people riding on that train.","Silver Streak"
"1265",6311936,6315133,"Oh, no.You see, the standard procedure...","Silver Streak"
"1266",6315206,6318505,"in such an emergencywould be to derail the train.","Silver Streak"
"1267",6318576,6321340,"Derail it?In the middle of the yard?","Silver Streak"
"1268",6321412,6325678,"Yes. Actually,I can't take that responsibility.
Uh, I'd better get my boss.","Silver Streak"
"1269",6325750,6328878,"You better do something,you idiot, because in 10 minutes...","Silver Streak"
"1270",6328953,6332389,"you're gonna have200 tons of locomotive
smashing through Central Station...","Silver Streak"
"1271",6332456,6334390,"on its way to Marshall Fields!","Silver Streak"

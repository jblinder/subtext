"333",2660871,2666036,"The first timehe saw Seabiscuit, the colt was walking
through the fog at 5:00 in the morning.","Seabiscuit"
"334",2667511,2671572,"Smith would say later that the horselooked right through him...","Seabiscuit"
"335",2671648,2674913,"as if to say,""What the hell are you looking at?","Seabiscuit"
"336",2674985,2679820,"- Who do you think you are?""","Seabiscuit"
"337",2679890,2682654,"He was a small horse,barely 15 hands.","Seabiscuit"
"338",2682726,2687493,"He was hurting too.There was a limp in his walk,","Seabiscuit"
"339",2687564,2691091,"a wheezing when he breathed.","Seabiscuit"
"340",2691168,2693728,"Smith didn't pay attentionto that.","Seabiscuit"
"341",2693804,2698468,"He was looking the horsein the eye.","Seabiscuit"
"342",2698542,2702342,"God... damn.","Seabiscuit"
"343",2708518,2713114,"He was the son of Hard Tack,sired by the mighty Man O' War.","Seabiscuit"
"344",2713190,2716956,"But the breeding did littleto impress anyone at Claiborne Farms.","Seabiscuit"
"345",2717027,2719928,"Get rid of him.","Seabiscuit"
"346",2724201,2728968,"At six months,he was shipped off to train with
the legendary trainer Sunny Fitzsimmons,","Seabiscuit"
"347",2729039,2732770,"who, over time,developed a similar opinion of the colt.","Seabiscuit"
"348",2732843,2736609,"Is that a racehorseor a lead pony?","Seabiscuit"
"349",2737814,2741045,"The judgment wasn't helpedby his gentle nature.","Seabiscuit"
"350",2741118,2745851,"Where his sire had been a fierce,almost violent competitor,","Seabiscuit"
"351",2745923,2748892,"Seabiscuit took to sleepingfor huge chunks of the day...","Seabiscuit"
"352",2748959,2754158,"and enjoyed lolling for hoursunder the boughs of the juniper trees.","Seabiscuit"
"353",2754231,2757792,"His other great talent was eating.","Seabiscuit"
"354",2757868,2763238,"Though half the size of other colts,Seabiscuit could frequently
eat twice as much.","Seabiscuit"
"355",2764541,2767567,"Fitzsimmons decidedthe horse was lazy...","Seabiscuit"
"356",2767644,2771239,"and felt sure he could trainthe obstinance out of him.","Seabiscuit"
"357",2771315,2775752,"I want you to hit himas many times as you can
over a quarter of a mile.","Seabiscuit"
"358",2775819,2780188,"When he didn't improve,they decided the colt
was incorrigible.","Seabiscuit"
"359",2782125,2784616,"They made him a training partnerto better horses,","Seabiscuit"
"360",2784695,2787186,"forcing him to losehead-to-head duels...","Seabiscuit"
"361",2787264,2789630,"to boost the confidenceof the other animal.","Seabiscuit"
"362",2790934,2792868,"By the timehe was three years old,","Seabiscuit"
"363",2792936,2796394,"Seabiscuit was strugglingin two cheap claiming races a week.","Seabiscuit"
"364",2797841,2802175,"Soon he grew as bitter and angryas his sire Hard Tack had been.","Seabiscuit"
"365",2804648,2808084,"He was soldfor the rock-bottom price
of $2,000.","Seabiscuit"
"366",2812022,2814752,"And, of course,it all made sense.","Seabiscuit"
"367",2814825,2818625,"Champions were large,they were sleek,","Seabiscuit"
"368",2818695,2820686,"they were without imperfection.","Seabiscuit"
"369",2822165,2826124,"When they finally did race him,he did just what
they had trained him to do.","Seabiscuit"
"370",2826203,2828137,"He lost.","Seabiscuit"
"371",2830574,2832508,"What exactlyis it you like?","Seabiscuit"
"372",2832576,2835602,"He's got spirit.","Seabiscuit"
"373",2835679,2838239,"I'll say.","Seabiscuit"
"374",2839549,2843110,"Can... Can he be ridden?Oh, sure.","Seabiscuit"
"375",2846656,2849716,"Eventually.","Seabiscuit"
"376",2849793,2853729,"He can bea little touchy.
Yeah, I got it.","Seabiscuit"
"377",2853797,2856425,"No. Really.","Seabiscuit"
"378",2856500,2858491,"I'm fine.","Seabiscuit"

"577",2413912,2415120,"- Yes.- Why?","The Birds"
"578",2415830,2418040,"Because it seemedstupid and foolish.","The Birds"
"579",2418124,2419500,"Like jumping intoa fountain in Rome.","The Birds"
"580",2419584,2420626,"I told you what happened!","The Birds"

"603",2501249,2503125,"Gets a bit chilly hereat night sometimes,","The Birds"
"604",2503209,2505460,"especially if you'reover near the bay.","The Birds"
"605",2507589,2509756,"Well, how did your evening go?","The Birds"
"606",2511342,2513594,"Did you meet Lydia?","The Birds"
"607",2514721,2516597,"Or would you ratherI changed the subject?","The Birds"
"608",2517223,2518724,"I think so.","The Birds"
"609",2520602,2522603,"Well, how do youlike our little hamlet?","The Birds"
"610",2523605,2525189,"I despise it.","The Birds"
"611",2526608,2529526,"Well, I suppose it doesn't offermuch to the casual visitor,","The Birds"
"612",2529611,2532613,"unless you're thrilled by acollection of shacks on a hillside.","The Birds"
"613",2532697,2534865,"It takes a bit ofgetting used to.","The Birds"
"614",2534949,2536533,"Where are you fromoriginally, Annie?","The Birds"
"615",2536618,2537868,"San Francisco.","The Birds"
"616",2537952,2540078,"How did you happento come up here?","The Birds"
"617",2542498,2547127,"A friend invited me up fora weekend a long time ago.","The Birds"
"618",2548963,2551048,"Look, I see no reasonfor being coy about this.","The Birds"
"619",2551132,2553133,"It was Mitch Brenner.I guess you knew that anyway.","The Birds"
"620",2553218,2554801,"I suspected as much.","The Birds"
"621",2556471,2558055,"Well, you needn't worry.","The Birds"
"622",2558139,2560265,"It's been over and donewith a long time ago.","The Birds"
"623",2560934,2563644,"Annie, there's nothingbetween Mr. Brenner and me.","The Birds"
"624",2563728,2565187,"Isn't there?","The Birds"
"625",2566356,2567898,"Well, maybe there isn't.","The Birds"
"626",2567982,2570651,"Maybe there's never been anythingbetween Mitch and any girl.","The Birds"
"627",2571736,2573570,"What do you mean?","The Birds"
"628",2573655,2576740,"I think I'll have some of that.","The Birds"
"629",2576824,2579576,"I was seeing a lot of himin San Francisco.","The Birds"
"630",2579661,2581912,"Then one weekend, he invitedme up to meet Lydia.","The Birds"
"631",2581996,2583455,"When was this?","The Birds"
"632",2583539,2587251,"Oh, four years ago, shortlyafter his father died.","The Birds"
"633",2587877,2590420,"Of course, thingsmay be different now.","The Birds"
"634",2590505,2591588,"Different?","The Birds"
"635",2592966,2594383,"With Lydia.","The Birds"
"636",2595176,2597219,"Did she seem a trifle distant?","The Birds"
"637",2597303,2598512,"A trifle.","The Birds"
"638",2599347,2601848,"Well, then perhaps thingsaren't quite so different.","The Birds"
"639",2602976,2605435,"You know, her attitudenearly drove me crazy.","The Birds"
"640",2605520,2607104,"When I got backto San Francisco,","The Birds"
"641",2607188,2609898,"I spent days trying to figure outexactly what I'd done to displease her.","The Birds"
"642",2610650,2611692,"Well, what had you done?","The Birds"
"643",2612735,2613944,"Nothing.","The Birds"
"644",2614028,2618740,"I simply existed. So what's the answer?A jealous woman, right?","The Birds"
"645",2618825,2620784,"A clinging, possessive mother?","The Birds"
"646",2620868,2622244,"Wrong.","The Birds"
"647",2622328,2623704,"With all duerespect to Oedipus,","The Birds"
"648",2623788,2624871,"I don't thinkthat was the case.","The Birds"
"649",2624956,2626581,"Then what was it?","The Birds"
"650",2628334,2631044,"Lydia liked me.That's the strange part.","The Birds"
"651",2631796,2634047,"Now that I'm no longer a threat,we're very good friends.","The Birds"
"652",2634132,2636049,"Then why did she object to you?","The Birds"
"653",2637427,2638552,"Because she was afraid.","The Birds"
"654",2638636,2640512,"Afraid you'd take Mitch?","The Birds"
"655",2641431,2642931,"Afraid I'd give Mitch.","The Birds"
"656",2643141,2644766,"I don't understand.","The Birds"
"657",2644851,2646310,"Afraid of any womanwho would give Mitch","The Birds"
"658",2646394,2649104,"the one thingLydia can give him, love.","The Birds"
"659",2649188,2651732,"That adds up to a jealous,possessive woman.","The Birds"
"660",2652483,2654860,"No, I don't think so.","The Birds"
"661",2654944,2658113,"You see, she's not afraidof losing Mitch.","The Birds"
"662",2658865,2660490,"She's only afraidof being abandoned.","The Birds"
"663",2660575,2662909,"Someone ought to tell hershe'd be gaining a daughter.","The Birds"
"664",2665079,2667998,"No. She alreadyhas a daughter.","The Birds"
"665",2668082,2671793,"Well, what about Mitch? Didn't hehave anything to say about this?","The Birds"
"666",2673171,2675756,"Well, I can understandhis position.","The Birds"
"667",2675840,2678425,"He'd just been through a lot withLydia after his father died.","The Birds"
"668",2678509,2680385,"He didn't want to riskgoing through it all again.","The Birds"
"669",2680720,2682054,"Oh, I see.","The Birds"
"670",2682138,2684639,"So it ended.Not right then, of course.","The Birds"
"671",2684724,2688060,"We went back to San Francisco,saw each other now and then,","The Birds"
"672",2688144,2689644,"but we both knew it was over.","The Birds"
"673",2689729,2691772,"Then what are you doinghere in Bodega Bay?","The Birds"
"674",2692815,2694274,"I wanted to be near Mitch.","The Birds"
"675",2695276,2697944,"Oh, it was over and donewith, and I knew it, but...","The Birds"
"676",2698029,2700030,"I still wanted to be near him.","The Birds"
"677",2700740,2702741,"You see, I still like hima hell of a lot,","The Birds"
"678",2704202,2707996,"and I don't want tolose that friendship, ever.","The Birds"
"679",2717882,2718965,"Hello.","The Birds"

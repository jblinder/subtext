"43",381089,385287,"On the contrary, I thinkit's an excellent idea, as far as it goes.","Sirocco"
"44",385369,387803,"But why shoot only five hostages?","Sirocco"

"74",516209,517608,"Perhaps you're right.","Sirocco"
"75",518169,521286,"Perhaps sending someoneto see the Emir is the best way.","Sirocco"
"76",523649,525640,"That pleases you, doesn't it?","Sirocco"
"77",528329,530047,"It's worth a try.","Sirocco"
"78",531289,533007,"But I'm not sending you.","Sirocco"

"743",4109289,4113840,"Mr. Harry, is this what you were looking for?","Sirocco"
"744",4114849,4117317,"Since when are you giving back money?What are you up to?","Sirocco"

"749",4164209,4166643,"This belongs to you, I believe.","Sirocco"
"750",4167369,4172284,"You dropped it running away.Not quite as valuable as your neck?","Sirocco"
"751",4174049,4175641,"Having fun, Colonel?","Sirocco"
"752",4177129,4179484,"We suspected you for quite a while.","Sirocco"
"753",4180289,4182757,"The charge against you isrunning guns and ammunition.","Sirocco"
"754",4182849,4184760,"Have you anything to say?","Sirocco"
"755",4186089,4188603,"If you can prove it, what can I say?","Sirocco"
"756",4188929,4193445,"Last night we arrested one Nasir Salim,a friend of yours.","Sirocco"
"757",4194529,4195928,"We have his full confession.","Sirocco"
"758",4196009,4198443,"The evidence against youis incontrovertible.","Sirocco"
"759",4198889,4200322,"Do you know the penalty?","Sirocco"
"760",4201969,4204847,"A slug in the headand a hole in the ground.","Sirocco"
"761",4207209,4211885,"I have here your dossier.It contains the history of your life.","Sirocco"

"763",4221409,4224924,"You supply the Syrians with gunsand ammunition. But I respect them.","Sirocco"
"764",4225009,4229082,"They fight for a cause.Your cause is only money.","Sirocco"
"765",4230249,4233924,"While Frenchmen and Syrianskill each other, you profit by it.","Sirocco"
"766",4236449,4239122,"According to military law,you have to be shot.","Sirocco"
"767",4239209,4241723,"The punishment seems hardly adequate.","Sirocco"
"768",4241809,4245961,"What have you got me up here for?To watch me sweat, to watch me crawl?","Sirocco"
"769",4246369,4249486,"I'll bet they didn't bring Nasir up herebefore they shot him.","Sirocco"
"770",4249569,4251048,"What a pity you could only die once.","Sirocco"
"771",4251129,4254121,"Sure, I know I'm going to be shot,but not for running guns.","Sirocco"
"772",4254209,4257042,"But because I'm something special.I made a monkey out of you.","Sirocco"
"773",4257129,4259768,"I'm the guy that ran off with your girl!","Sirocco"
"774",4263689,4267523,"Don't you realise if I wanted you shotyou'd be in a ditch right now?","Sirocco"

"778",4290329,4292604,"Can you reach any of his people?","Sirocco"
"779",4293049,4294482,"I think I can.","Sirocco"
"780",4300809,4303721,"If you can arrange a meeting for mewith Emir Hassan...","Sirocco"
"781",4303809,4307006,"...I'll get you a passthat'll get you out of the city.","Sirocco"
"782",4310129,4311642,"Mind if I smoke?","Sirocco"

"788",4361849,4364682,"- What about my money?- Confiscated.","Sirocco"
"789",4365889,4367561,"I'm dead without it.","Sirocco"
"790",4369809,4372198,"Let's say you'll be alive in a new way.","Sirocco"
"791",4383889,4388087,"The last time I wore this suit, I was in Cairo.","Sirocco"
"792",4394049,4396643,"When do you want me to tell the old man?","Sirocco"
"793",4397529,4399645,"He'd try to stop me if he knew.","Sirocco"
"794",4401449,4403644,"Better give me an hour.","Sirocco"
"795",4410249,4411204,"John.","Sirocco"

"800",4427609,4429918,"I've decided to arrange it.","Sirocco"
"801",4431089,4433683,"- Don't you think you ought to wait?- No.","Sirocco"
"802",4436649,4439607,"I want everything settled before I return.","Sirocco"
"803",4441489,4444128,"All the documents are in that envelope.","Sirocco"
"804",4445369,4450568,"If she needs any help, I'd appreciate itif you'd take care of it for me.","Sirocco"
"805",4450649,4452082,"I understand.","Sirocco"

"861",4701849,4703646,"Would you like to go with me?","Sirocco"
"862",4703729,4706402,"We'll discuss later who's going with who.","Sirocco"
"863",4706489,4709765,"- What are we waiting for?- I'm ready. My bags are all packed.","Sirocco"
"864",4709969,4713041,"I got to get my pass.I'll pick you up at your apartment.","Sirocco"
"865",4713129,4715518,"We are going to have fun, aren't we, Harry?","Sirocco"
"866",4715689,4719318,"I don't know whether I'm too good for youor you're too good for me.","Sirocco"
"867",4720009,4722000,"I have Mr. Smith here.","Sirocco"

"870",4729809,4731800,"- ... and you'd give me my pass.- Come with me.","Sirocco"
"871",4731889,4735086,"Do you mind telling me where we're going,or is it a military secret?","Sirocco"
"872",4735169,4736488,"You'll see.","Sirocco"
"873",4740969,4742448,"Mr. Smith, sir.","Sirocco"
"874",4744929,4746647,"Come in, Mr. Smith.","Sirocco"
"875",4749569,4751321,"Mr. Smith, sir.","Sirocco"
"876",4765289,4769441,"I'm informed that you arranged a meetingbetween Col. Feroud and Emir Hassan.","Sirocco"
"877",4770289,4771688,"That's right.","Sirocco"
"878",4772289,4774757,"I suppose you knewthat they wouldn't let him come back?","Sirocco"
"879",4774849,4777761,"- I tried to tell him.- Never mind what you tried to tell him.","Sirocco"
"880",4777849,4781637,"Where did they take him?Where is he now? I want every detail.","Sirocco"
"881",4782009,4784603,"He met the contact, they walked away.That's all I know.","Sirocco"
"882",4784689,4789160,"- You know more than that, Mr. Smith.- Col. Feroud is a very important officer.","Sirocco"
"883",4789249,4792321,"Gen. La Salle would doeverything possible to save him.","Sirocco"
"884",4792409,4794798,"We want to knowwhere their headquarters are.","Sirocco"
"885",4794889,4797119,"That wasn't the deal I madewith Col. Feroud.","Sirocco"
"886",4797209,4799928,"Mr. Smith, I advise you to be cooperative.","Sirocco"
"887",4800249,4803639,"If I don't play ball, I don't get my pass.Is that it?","Sirocco"
"888",4804729,4806924,"Sign this man's pass.","Sirocco"
"889",4809969,4812802,"If Col. Feroud gave his word,we must keep it for him.","Sirocco"
"890",4812889,4814117,"Yes, sir.","Sirocco"
"891",4834929,4837318,"I had hopes this man would help us.","Sirocco"
"892",4842089,4844444,"He's as good as dead, and you know it.","Sirocco"
"893",4844529,4847362,"We have to try, we have to make some effort.","Sirocco"
"894",4847449,4850680,"They'll cut him into little piecesbefore you can get to him.","Sirocco"
"895",4857249,4858648,"Can I go now?","Sirocco"
"896",4859289,4860608,"You may go.","Sirocco"
"897",4861009,4863284,"Sorry I couldn't help you out.","Sirocco"
"898",4870449,4873759,"They always need money.You might offer them money.","Sirocco"
"899",4879569,4880888,"How much would you say?","Sirocco"
"900",4880969,4884006,"�10,000.They know he's head of Intelligence.","Sirocco"
"901",4885169,4889048,"- I think we can manage that.- Sir, it would be a job to contact them.","Sirocco"
"902",4889249,4891638,"The last time we tried,our man got his throat cut.","Sirocco"
"903",4891729,4894289,"It's very easy to dowhen you deal with people like that.","Sirocco"
"904",4894369,4896360,"You managed to get Col. Feroud to them.","Sirocco"
"905",4896449,4898246,"Let's say I was lucky.","Sirocco"
"906",4898809,4900845,"Maybe you could get lucky again.","Sirocco"
"907",4900929,4903443,"Maybe you could get money to themif you really wanted to.","Sirocco"
"908",4903529,4905281,"Sorry, no dice.","Sirocco"
"909",4905569,4908561,"You definitely refuseto take one of our officers to them?","Sirocco"
"910",4908649,4909684,"I do.","Sirocco"
"911",4910009,4911044,"Why?","Sirocco"
"912",4911209,4914645,"Because I'd be risking my neckever to show up at their headquarters again.","Sirocco"
"913",4914729,4917527,"They've already warned me,and believe me, they meant business.","Sirocco"
"914",4917609,4919201,"We'd protect you.","Sirocco"
"915",4920009,4922364,"When you get down there,nobody can protect you.","Sirocco"
"916",4922449,4924644,"Why should I take a chance like this?","Sirocco"
"917",4924849,4928239,"Because maybe you'd like to do somethingfine and unselfish for a change.","Sirocco"
"918",4928329,4932288,"Maybe you'd get a kick out of tryingto save a wonderful man's life.","Sirocco"
"919",4932609,4934167,"And lose my own?","Sirocco"
"920",4942689,4944645,"It's a real long shot, isn't it?","Sirocco"
"921",4945889,4948642,"But I've been playing them all my life. Okay.","Sirocco"
"922",4950009,4951408,"Let's try it.","Sirocco"

"924",4957169,4959160,"- Did the Colonel go there?- Yes.","Sirocco"
"925",4959249,4960284,"You, too?","Sirocco"
"926",4961209,4962198,"Why?","Sirocco"
"927",4962329,4965048,"I was just wonderinghow you two happened.","Sirocco"
"928",4965289,4968725,"Usually all they teach you ishow to tell somebody else to go out and die.","Sirocco"
"929",4968809,4970288,"Pour la patrie.","Sirocco"
"930",4971769,4974158,"You look like the kind of fellawho might be married.","Sirocco"
"931",4974249,4978128,"Yes. Matter of fact, I just celebrateda wedding anniversary.","Sirocco"
"932",4978809,4980037,"Any kids?","Sirocco"
"933",4980689,4982884,"Just one. A boy.","Sirocco"
"934",4983809,4988007,"- Are you going to send him to St. Cyr?- Yes, if he wants to be a soldier.","Sirocco"
"935",4988969,4992279,"That's fine. He'll follow in your footsteps.That's great.","Sirocco"
"936",4993329,4996719,"It's a great life. Nothing like handing it onto a bunch of kids.","Sirocco"
"937",4996809,4999528,"They'd break your neckif they knew what was coming.","Sirocco"
"938",4999609,5002999,"You're very bitter, Mr. Smith.How did you get that way?","Sirocco"
"939",5003569,5006367,"The facts of life.Some learn and some don't.","Sirocco"
"940",5028849,5030885,"What is this place? Where are we?","Sirocco"
"941",5030969,5034518,"The ancient Roman catacombswhere they used to bury their dead.","Sirocco"
"942",5034609,5036201,"It smells like it.","Sirocco"
"943",5045129,5047359,"You were toldyou were no longer welcome here.","Sirocco"
"944",5047449,5049360,"I'll be welcome this time.","Sirocco"
"945",5049449,5053237,"I've been authorised to negotiatethe release of Col. Feroud.","Sirocco"
"946",5053689,5056681,"You are now representing the French,Mr. Smith?","Sirocco"
"947",5058489,5060923,"Yeah, I guess that's what you'd call it.","Sirocco"
"948",5061209,5064599,"I won't start with �5,000and let you work me up to �8,000 or �9,000.","Sirocco"
"949",5064689,5067726,"I'll lay my cards on the table. �10,000.","Sirocco"
"950",5068249,5070638,"That's my offer for Col. Feroud.","Sirocco"
"951",5071289,5075521,"I see. And this, I presume,is a French officer?","Sirocco"
"952",5075969,5078563,"Maj. Leon, French Intelligence Service.","Sirocco"
"953",5080889,5082561,"You will wait here.","Sirocco"
"954",5094289,5096598,"You never know about these characters.","Sirocco"
"955",5099409,5100603,"You never know.","Sirocco"
"956",5105409,5106444,"Come.","Sirocco"
"957",5118689,5120998,"Your Excellency, I had to see you.","Sirocco"
"958",5121889,5126201,"You are seeing me.That's more than your other emissary did.","Sirocco"
"959",5127449,5130168,"Someone cut his throat before he got here.","Sirocco"
"960",5136209,5137767,"What do you want?","Sirocco"
"961",5138049,5140609,"I've come to make an appeal to reason.","Sirocco"
"962",5141009,5145366,"You expect me to be reasonable?How can I be reasonable with the French?","Sirocco"
"963",5146529,5149885,"Isn't it possible your hatred of the Frenchblinds you?","Sirocco"
"964",5150289,5154521,"What are you trying to tell me?That we are defeated? We are lost?","Sirocco"
"965",5155369,5160363,"We do not fight to win. You will win.But it will be a victory you will regret.","Sirocco"
"966",5160969,5164041,"The world shall know youfor the butchers you are.","Sirocco"
"967",5164449,5166724,"Those are the words of a fanatic.","Sirocco"
"968",5167689,5169919,"What did you expect?","Sirocco"
"969",5171529,5173963,"I'm not interested in what you have to say.","Sirocco"
"970",5174449,5177009,"But my soldiers haven't hadmuch pleasure lately.","Sirocco"
"971",5177089,5180240,"I shall give you to them.You may talk to them.","Sirocco"
"972",5180329,5182797,"They will give youthe attention you deserve.","Sirocco"
"973",5195729,5199517,"We have just had word from your general.He's worried about you.","Sirocco"
"974",5200089,5204719,"He wants to save your life.He offers �10,000.","Sirocco"
"975",5206489,5210323,"My soldiers will be disappointed,but I think I should sell you.","Sirocco"
"976",5211249,5214286,"With �10,000 I can kill a lot of Frenchmen.","Sirocco"
"977",5215249,5217638,"You will also kill a lot of Syrians.","Sirocco"
"978",5218849,5222125,"We will die gladly.Yes. I think I will sell you.","Sirocco"
"979",5226689,5229761,"�10,000. A good bargain.","Sirocco"
"980",5232889,5235847,"Why don't you do both?Take the money and kill me, too?","Sirocco"
"981",5237249,5240082,"You want to die? Why do you want to die?","Sirocco"
"982",5240689,5242884,"I only want to arrange a truce.","Sirocco"
"983",5243169,5247401,"Cease fire for 24 hours, so thatSyrians and Frenchmen can sit together.","Sirocco"
"984",5252329,5255639,"And what shall we discuss,the terms of our surrender?","Sirocco"
"985",5256849,5260046,"We can try to settle our differencesaccording to the dignity of man.","Sirocco"
"986",5260129,5264042,"There is dignity in men willingto give their lives for what they believe in?","Sirocco"
"987",5264129,5267883,"- Men needn't die to prove their dignity.- You're asking me to surrender!","Sirocco"
"988",5268169,5272242,"I'm asking you to consider your people.An effort must be made.","Sirocco"
"989",5272329,5275526,"We must make some effort.Otherwise, we're not civilised men.","Sirocco"
"990",5275889,5280246,"Perhaps we'll fail, and the war will go on,but at least we will have tried.","Sirocco"
"991",5280329,5281921,"That's all I want.","Sirocco"
"992",5291769,5293361,"Colonel, you are a fool.","Sirocco"
"993",5293449,5297362,"I come to talk of peace and understanding,and you call me a fool?","Sirocco"
"994",5297489,5298842,"Yes, Colonel.","Sirocco"
"995",5298969,5302564,"I respect you.But you are a dreamer and a fool.","Sirocco"
"996",5307049,5309358,"What am I doing down here anyway?","Sirocco"
"997",5312449,5315168,"I got my pass, I got a nice trip to Cairo.","Sirocco"
"998",5319889,5324280,"You, come with me. No, you, Mr. Smith.","Sirocco"

"1000",5356609,5358645,"It looks like we got away with it.","Sirocco"
"1001",5362889,5364322,"There you are.","Sirocco"
"1002",5365849,5369159,"�10,000, one colonel. That was the deal.","Sirocco"

"1004",5378169,5380399,"I sure thought you were a goner.","Sirocco"
"1005",5381089,5383842,"Buying my freedom was your idea,I suppose?","Sirocco"
"1006",5383929,5385248,"Yes, it was.","Sirocco"
"1007",5388009,5389601,"Why did you do it?","Sirocco"
"1008",5389809,5392482,"I should think you'd wantto see me out of the way.","Sirocco"
"1009",5392569,5394878,"I made a little money on the deal.","Sirocco"
"1010",5396129,5399360,"- I see.- I saved your life and you seem to resent it.","Sirocco"
"1011",5399449,5400484,"I do.","Sirocco"
"1012",5402209,5404848,"Maybe you should have had me shotafter all.","Sirocco"
"1013",5405769,5407043,"I agree.","Sirocco"
"1014",5408929,5410248,"May I leave now?","Sirocco"

"1017",5427449,5428677,"What's on your mind?","Sirocco"
"1018",5428769,5430885,"I thought you were toldnever to come here again.","Sirocco"
"1019",5430969,5432561,"You needed money. I did you a favour.","Sirocco"
"1020",5432649,5436528,"You showed Maj. Leon throughthe catacombs, the way to our headquarters.","Sirocco"
"1021",5436969,5440279,"The French were a little reluctantto trust me alone with all this money.","Sirocco"
"1022",5440369,5443725,"- What did you tell the French?- Nothing! What would I tell them?","Sirocco"
"1023",5443809,5447404,"About the ammunition we bought from you.About our contacts.","Sirocco"
"1024",5448369,5451566,"About the way we broke throughtheir blockade. Come now, Mr. Smith.","Sirocco"
"1025",5451649,5454322,"We know you're working for the French.They're your friends.","Sirocco"
"1026",5454409,5457719,"- I'm strictly neutral.- In times like this, how can you be neutral?","Sirocco"
"1027",5457809,5459481,"You have to be on one side or the other.","Sirocco"
"1028",5459569,5462481,"I'm a businessman. I do business with you.Why would I spoil it?","Sirocco"
"1029",5462569,5466118,"To save your neck.The French usually shoot people like you.","Sirocco"
"1030",5466889,5468641,"Why aren't you dead?","Sirocco"
"1031",5470649,5472685,"I told you, I'm in this strictly for business.","Sirocco"
"1032",5472769,5474521,"How many timesdo you want me to prove it?","Sirocco"

"1038",5491969,5495405,"Don't you think, Colonel,we ought to pay him a little in advance?","Sirocco"

"873",4390762,4393180,"He's led you up the garden path,I'm afraid.","Strangers on a Train"
"874",4396893,4399603,"He must be very desperateto try to involve me.","Strangers on a Train"
"875",4399771,4403106,"I've been protecting him sincethat conversation on the train...","Strangers on a Train"
"876",4403274,4406026,"...when he told mehow much he hated his wife.","Strangers on a Train"
"877",4411365,4415535,"He tried to get me to go backto the island one night after dark...","Strangers on a Train"

"881",4426380,4429633,"...is one piece of evidenceto convict Guy of the murder.","Strangers on a Train"
"882",4430718,4432719,"It's had me so worried.","Strangers on a Train"
"883",4433221,4436932,"But, of course, I couldn't do it.It would be too risky.","Strangers on a Train"
"884",4437225,4440435,"And besides, it would make mean accessory.","Strangers on a Train"
"885",4442563,4446483,"Oh, Miss Morton.I understand how you feel.","Strangers on a Train"
"886",4447485,4450403,"Now, if you'll excuse me,I have an urgent appointment.","Strangers on a Train"

"889",4489277,4492279,"...that's all they'd need to proveyou were at the scene.","Strangers on a Train"
"890",4492446,4497117,"That lie about my wanting him to getit back means he'll put it on that island.","Strangers on a Train"
"891",4497285,4500745,"I wanted to help, but I'm afraidall I did is make things worse.","Strangers on a Train"

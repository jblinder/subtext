"15",98882,101180,"They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"16",101251,103981,"but I had my suspicionsabout the Directress of Training.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"17",104053,106078,"Now, as to salary, it's quite good.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"18",106156,108488,"- $200 a month.- That is good.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"20",110860,112725,"I'm afraid I can't tell you much...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"21",112796,115356,"only that the patient is the wifeof Mr. Paul Holland...","Fifty Shades Darker"

"36",169686,171153,"""How beautiful.""","Fifty Shades Darker"
"37",171254,172585,"It's not beautiful!","Fifty Shades Darker"

"53",229545,232013,"Something clean and honest...","Fifty Shades Darker"

"73",329312,332543,"I was to know all the nooks and cranniesof that great house...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"74",332615,336415,"to love them or hate them,according to what happened there.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"75",336486,339717,"In that house,I was to hear a strange confession...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"76",339789,343987,"a confession only madness could havewrung from the lips of a sane person.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"77",344060,346187,"And yet it was in the same room...","Fifty Shades Darker"

"106",443459,444983,"But you are an American.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"107",445061,447825,"I went to school in Buffalo.Paul went to school in England.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"108",447897,450297,"I wondered about your different accents.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"109",450366,453563,"I'm still wondering about your names,Rand and Holland.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"146",775724,778192,"Mr. Paul, yes, there was crying tonight.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"152",810726,814093,"She didn't soothe me any,hollering around in the tower.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"156",823939,826806,"- A figure of Saint Sebastian.- Yes.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"157",826876,829140,"But it was once the figureheadof a slave ship.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"159",831247,833442,"from the misery and pain of slavery.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"160",833516,835882,"For generations, they found life a burden.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"161",835951,840081,"That's why they still weep when a childis born and make merry at a burial.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"162",843926,847089,"I've told you, Miss Connell,this is a sad place.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"163",865447,867278,"Good morning, miss.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"168",879261,881092,"just like I do for Miss Jessica.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"169",881163,884360,"But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma.You don't have to do that for me.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"170",884433,886298,"I know it, miss, but I like to do it.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"182",916465,919127,"We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma,you and I.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"183",919201,920532,"I do my best.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"184",920603,924437,"Every day I dress her just as beautifullyas if she was well.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"185",924540,927168,"It's just like dressing a great big doll.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"186",928744,930109,"What's this?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"187",930179,933410,"A puffup, I call it.But Miss Jessica always says brioche.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"188",933482,934847,"Looks like an awful lot of breakfast.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"189",934917,936942,"I don't knowwhether I'll be able to get away with it.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"190",939555,941523,"I made it clearin my letter to the company...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"191",941590,943615,"this is not a position for a frightened girl.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"192",943692,945057,"I am not a frightened girl.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"193",945127,947561,"That's hard to believeafter what happened last night.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"194",947630,949689,"If I were as timid as you seem to think,Mr. Holland...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"195",949765,952029,"I wouldn't have gone to the towerin the first place.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"196",953202,956365,"And what's so alarming about the tower,Miss Connell?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"197",956572,958130,"Nothing really.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"198",958240,961676,"But you must admitit's an eerie sort of place, so dark.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"199",961744,963769,"Surely, nurses aren't afraid of the dark?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"200",963846,965108,"Of course not.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"201",966115,969084,"I used to be afraid of the darkwhen I was a child.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"203",974456,978415,"Frankly, it was something of a shock tosee my patient that way for the first time.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"424",1750999,1752990,"and a woman driven madby her own husband...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"425",1753067,1754625,"do you love that?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"426",1754702,1756431,"You didn't drive her mad.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"427",1760241,1764143,"Before Jessica was taken ill,there was a scene...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"428",1765713,1767271,"an ugly scene.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"429",1768016,1769813,"I told her she couldn't go...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"430",1769884,1772819,"that I'd keep her here by force,if necessary.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"431",1774422,1776856,"You never knew Jessica as she was.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"432",1781429,1784592,"I think it would be best for all of usnot to discuss this again.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"433",1784666,1787362,"Thank you. I know you meant to be kind.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"434",1799113,1802173,"I don't know how their own loveis revealed to other women.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"435",1802250,1804946,"Maybe in their sweetheart's arms,I don't know.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"436",1805086,1806747,"To me it came that night...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"437",1806821,1809688,"after Paul Holland had almost thrust mefrom the room...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"438",1809791,1811816,"certainly from his life.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"439",1811893,1813952,"I said I love him.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"440",1814929,1818160,"Even as I said it,I knew he still loved his wife.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"441",1819300,1823327,"And then, because I loved him,I felt I had to restore her to him...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"442",1823705,1826139,"to make her what she'd been before...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"443",1826774,1828401,"to make him happy.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"444",1833882,1836316,"All that you say comes to the same thing.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"445",1836384,1839478,"You are asking me to pass a sentenceof life or death on my wife.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"446",1839554,1842580,"Insulin shock treatmentis an extreme measure, Paul...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"447",1842657,1845626,"as Miss Connell pointed outwhen she suggested it to me, but...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"448",1845693,1849288,"You admit that this is terribly dangerous.So why do you advise it?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"449",1849364,1853027,"I've worked with it. I've seen cures.It's at least a hope.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"450",1853101,1856832,"It's the very danger itself, Paul,that makes the cure possible.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"451",1857138,1859629,"Insulin produces a state of coma.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"452",1859707,1863074,"Then the patient is revivedby a violent shock to the nerves.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"453",1863144,1865840,"That shock can kill, but it can also cure.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"454",1869684,1870912,"I don't know.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"455",1870985,1875479,"It's a hard decision to make,but yours is only a technical responsibility.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"456",1875623,1878319,"Technical responsibility.Real responsibility.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"457",1878393,1880190,"The question is, will she live or die?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"458",1880261,1883321,"You're wrong, Mr. Holland.It isn't a question of life or death.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"459",1883398,1885025,"Your wife isn't living.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"460",1885099,1888091,"She's in a worldthat's empty of joy or meaning.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"461",1888169,1890797,"We have a chanceto give her life back to her.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"462",1918266,1921064,"- Well?- She's alive, that's all.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"463",1924839,1926932,"Don't take it so much to heart, Betsy.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"464",1927008,1928737,"I imagined it so differently.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"465",1930144,1934205,"I've been waiting for hours,trying to imagine Jessica well again.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"466",1934882,1936679,"And I come bringing you nothing.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"467",1936751,1939549,"Instead, you come bringing me sympathy,Betsy...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"468",1939621,1942522,"and a generous heart. Don't forget that.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"469",1943291,1945282,"Don't call that nothing.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"470",1948162,1950858,"Very sad. Very sweet.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"471",1952233,1955498,"The noble husband and the noble nursecomforting each other...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"472",1955570,1957595,"because the patient still lives.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"473",1958940,1961465,"I've been imagining, too, Paul...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"474",1962043,1964568,"only I didn't have to wonder how I'd feel.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"475",1965146,1966408,"I knew.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"476",1968783,1971149,"I'm not in love with another woman.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"477",1989470,1992132,"I'm sorry, Miss Betsy.I'll take it right away.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"482",2002283,2005446,"He's a wonderful baby. He's beautiful, yes.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"483",2005787,2007049,"He's chosen you, miss.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"484",2007121,2010215,"That's what we say, Miss Betsy,when a baby first goes visiting.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"485",2010291,2012623,"Those he smiles at will be his friends.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"486",2012694,2014685,"That makes me very proud.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"487",2015263,2016924,"Here, Ti-Victor.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"488",2018166,2020225,"That's so you won't forget I'm your friend.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"502",2055536,2058061,"They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"503",2058206,2059639,"Mama Rose was mindless.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"504",2059707,2063507,"I was at the houmfort when the hounganbrought her mind back.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"554",2655169,2656693,"But what are you doing here?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"555",2676123,2678819,"...and when my husband died,I was helpless.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"556",2678892,2680291,"They disobeyed me.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"557",2681161,2684927,"And, accidentally, I discovered the secretof how to deal with them.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"558",2685532,2687591,"There was a woman with a baby.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"559",2687668,2692037,"Again and again, I begged herto boil the drinking water. She wouldn't.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"560",2692573,2694973,"Then I told her the god Shango...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"561",2695042,2698273,"would kill the evil spirits in the waterif she boiled it.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"562",2698779,2701270,"From then on, she boiled the water.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"563",2701348,2703578,"But that still doesn't explainwhy you're here.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"564",2703650,2706084,"Perhaps not, but I am here.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"579",2821568,2822796,"You know why.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"580",2823804,2826500,"You saw it the other night at the piano.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"581",2828275,2831836,"What I saw the other nightI could hardly believe, Betsy.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"582",2833146,2836946,"I thought I was looking at a womanwho had compassion for me...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"583",2837451,2838941,"who loved me.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"584",2840020,2842352,"And yet you made that tripto the houmfort...","Fifty Shades Darker"

"590",2865045,2866945,"I wish it were true...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"591",2868415,2870349,"perhaps for your sake.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"592",2876957,2878447,"Mind me now, horse.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"593",2878859,2880622,"Come away from there.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"594",2883664,2885097,"Are you ever stubborn.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"595",2885165,2887656,"Just like that old Sabreur manat the houmfort...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"596",2887734,2890464,"sticking your nose in placeswhere it isn't wanted...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"597",2890537,2892562,"making trouble for everybody.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"603",2907321,2909482,"Sounds sort of manlike, doesn't it?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"604",2910190,2912283,"- Whose horse?- The police horse.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"605",2912359,2914884,"Police? I didn't knowthere was a policeman on the island.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"610",2924404,2927237,"Yes, Miss Betsy.I expect there's some trouble...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"611",2927541,2930203,"not just little trouble,like Mr. Rand gets into...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"612",2930277,2933804,"when he's been drinking more than a little,but real big trouble.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"613",2933914,2937213,"You don't suppose it's because I tookMrs. Holland to the houmfort, do you?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"614",2937284,2940310,"They haven't been talking loud enoughfor me to hear, Miss Betsy.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"616",2943624,2945888,"And they've been just talking and talking.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"617",2945959,2947927,"I feel it's something very bad.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"618",2950130,2951688,"You do have a horse to hold, Alma...","Fifty Shades Darker"
"619",2951765,2955098,"and Mrs. Rand has asked meto have a cup of tea with her.","Fifty Shades Darker"

"732",3544624,3547821,"I kept seeing her face smilingbecause she was beautiful enough...","Fifty Shades Darker"

"740",3570617,3572778,"and asked him to make her a zombie.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"741",3573019,3574714,"Then what happened?","Fifty Shades Darker"
"742",3574954,3576512,"I hated myself.","Fifty Shades Darker"
"743",3576723,3579419,"On the way home,I said over and over again...","Fifty Shades Darker"

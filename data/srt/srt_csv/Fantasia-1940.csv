"2",119787,121579,"My name is Deems Taylor,","Fantasia"
"3",121663,124832,"and it's my very pleasant dutyto welcome you here","Fantasia"
"4",124917,127960,"on behalf of Walt Disney,Leopold Stokowski","Fantasia"
"5",128045,131631,"and all the other artists and musicianswhose combined talents","Fantasia"
"6",131715,136093,"went into the creation of thisnew form of entertainment, Fantasia.","Fantasia"
"7",138305,139972,"What you're going to see","Fantasia"
"8",140057,142642,"are the designsand pictures and stories","Fantasia"
"9",142726,145895,"that music inspiredin the minds and imaginations","Fantasia"
"10",145979,148439,"of a group of artists.","Fantasia"
"11",148524,149982,"In other words,these are not going to be","Fantasia"
"12",150067,152860,"the interpretationsof trained musicians.","Fantasia"
"13",152945,155238,"Which I think is all to the good.","Fantasia"
"14",155322,158699,"Now, there are three kinds of musicon this Fantasia program.","Fantasia"
"15",158784,161744,"First is the kind that tellsa definite story.","Fantasia"
"16",161829,164831,"Then there's the kind that,while it has no specific plot,","Fantasia"
"17",164915,168501,"does paint a series of, more or less,definite pictures.","Fantasia"
"18",168585,170127,"Then there's a third kind,","Fantasia"
"19",170212,173381,"music that exists simplyfor its own sake.","Fantasia"
"20",173465,176509,"Now, the number that opensour Fantasia program,","Fantasia"
"21",176593,180137,"the Toccata and Fugue,is music of this third kind,","Fantasia"
"22",180222,182515,"what we call absolute music.","Fantasia"
"23",182599,187103,"Even the title has no meaning beyonda description of the form of the music.","Fantasia"
"24",187187,191941,"What you will see on the screen is apicture of the various abstract images","Fantasia"
"25",192025,194026,"that might pass through your mind","Fantasia"
"26",194111,197697,"if you sat in a concert halllistening to this music.","Fantasia"
"27",197781,200575,"At first you're more or lessconscious of the orchestra.","Fantasia"
"28",200659,203911,"So our picture openswith a series of impressions","Fantasia"
"29",203996,205872,"of the conductor and the players.","Fantasia"
"30",205956,209834,"Then the music begins to suggestother things to your imagination.","Fantasia"
"31",209918,213588,"They might be, oh, just masses of color.","Fantasia"
"32",213672,217091,"Or they may be cloud formsor great landscapes","Fantasia"
"33",217175,222138,"or vague shadows or geometrical objectsfloating in space.","Fantasia"
"34",223140,224599,"So now we present","Fantasia"
"35",224683,228936,"the Toccata and Fugue in D Minorby Johann Sebastian Bach,","Fantasia"
"36",229021,232398,"interpreted in picturesby Walt Disney and his associates,","Fantasia"
"37",232482,234942,"and in musicby the Philadelphia Orchestra","Fantasia"
"38",235027,238696,"and its conductor, Leopold Stokowski.","Fantasia"
"39",824240,828660,"You know, it's funny how wrongan artist can be about his own work.","Fantasia"
"40",828745,832331,"Now, the one composition ofTchaikovsky's that he really detested","Fantasia"
"41",832415,834041,"was his Nutcracker Suite,","Fantasia"
"42",834125,836960,"which is probably the mostpopular thing he ever wrote.","Fantasia"
"43",837045,840214,"It's a series of dancestaken out of a full-length ballet","Fantasia"
"44",840298,841548,"called The Nutcracker","Fantasia"
"45",841633,844927,"that he once composedfor the St. Petersburg opera house.","Fantasia"
"46",845011,848430,"It wasn't much of a successand nobody performs it nowadays,","Fantasia"
"47",848515,852142,"but I'm pretty sure you'll recognize themusic of the Suite when you hear it.","Fantasia"
"48",852227,855812,"Incidentally, you won't seeany nutcracker on the screen.","Fantasia"
"49",855897,858106,"There's nothing leftof him but the title.","Fantasia"
"50",1731188,1735108,"And now we're going to hear a piece ofmusic that tells a very definite story.","Fantasia"
"51",1735192,1737902,"As a matter of fact, in this case,the story came first","Fantasia"
"52",1737986,1741364,"and the composer wrote the musicto go with it.","Fantasia"
"53",1741448,1745493,"It's a very old story,one that goes back almost 2,000 years.","Fantasia"
"54",1745577,1749080,"A legend about a sorcererwho had an apprentice.","Fantasia"
"55",1749164,1752417,"He was a bright young lad,very anxious to learn the business.","Fantasia"
"56",1752501,1755086,"As a matter of fact,he was a little bit too bright","Fantasia"
"57",1755170,1758714,"because he started practicingsome of the boss's best magic tricks","Fantasia"
"58",1758799,1761509,"before learning how to control them.","Fantasia"
"59",1761593,1764929,"One day, for instance,when he'd been told by his master","Fantasia"
"60",1765013,1769058,"to carry water to fill a cauldron,he had the brilliant idea","Fantasia"
"61",1769143,1772770,"of bringing a broomstick to lifeto carry the water for him.","Fantasia"
"62",1772855,1775606,"Well, this worked very well, at first.","Fantasia"
"63",1775691,1778943,"Unfortunately, however,having forgotten the magic formula","Fantasia"
"64",1779027,1782280,"that would make the broomstickstop carrying the water,","Fantasia"
"65",1782364,1785199,"he found he'd started somethinghe couldn't finish.","Fantasia"
"66",2351099,2354601,"Mr. Stokowski. Mr. Stokowski.","Fantasia"
"67",2356980,2359898,"My congratulations, sir.","Fantasia"
"68",2359983,2362484,"Congratulations to you, Mickey.","Fantasia"
"69",2362569,2364403,"Gee, thanks.","Fantasia"
"70",2364487,2367740,"Well, so long. I'll be seein' ya.","Fantasia"
"71",2369117,2370617,"Goodbye.","Fantasia"
"72",2378960,2383005,"When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,The Rite of Spring...","Fantasia"
"73",2398271,2399730,"I repeat,","Fantasia"
"74",2399814,2403734,"when Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,The Rite of Spring,","Fantasia"
"75",2403818,2407154,"his purpose was, in his own words,to ""express primitive life.""","Fantasia"
"76",2407238,2411241,"And so Walt Disney and his fellowartists have taken him at his word.","Fantasia"
"77",2411326,2414161,"Instead of presenting the balletin its original form,","Fantasia"
"78",2414245,2419041,"as a simple series of tribal dances,they have visualized it as a pageant,","Fantasia"
"79",2419125,2423087,"as the story of the growthof life on Earth.","Fantasia"
"80",2423171,2425506,"And that story,as you're going to see it,","Fantasia"
"81",2425590,2428008,"isn't the productof anybody's imagination.","Fantasia"
"82",2428093,2432179,"It's a coldly accurate reproductionofwhat science thinks went on","Fantasia"
"83",2432263,2435557,"during the first few billion yearsof this planet's existence.","Fantasia"
"84",2435642,2439478,"Science, not art,wrote the scenario of this picture.","Fantasia"
"85",2439562,2442523,"According to science,the first living things here","Fantasia"
"86",2442607,2444983,"were single-celled organisms,","Fantasia"
"87",2445068,2449279,"tiny little white or green blobsof nothing in particular","Fantasia"
"88",2449364,2451698,"that lived under the water.","Fantasia"
"89",2451783,2454368,"And then, as the ages passed,the oceans began to swarm","Fantasia"
"90",2454452,2456662,"with all kinds of marine creatures.","Fantasia"
"91",2456746,2459790,"Finally, after about a billion years,","Fantasia"
"92",2459874,2462626,"certain fish, more ambitiousthan the rest,","Fantasia"
"93",2462710,2466672,"crawled up on land and becamethe first amphibians.","Fantasia"
"94",2466756,2469883,"And then,several hundred million years ago,","Fantasia"
"95",2469968,2474096,"nature went off on another tackand produced the dinosaurs.","Fantasia"
"96",2474180,2477141,"Now, the name ""dinosaur""comes from two Greek words","Fantasia"
"97",2477225,2479268,"meaning ""terrible lizard.""","Fantasia"
"98",2479352,2481478,"And they certainly were all of that.","Fantasia"
"99",2481563,2483772,"They came in all shapes and sizes,","Fantasia"
"100",2483857,2487484,"from little, crawling horrorsabout the size of a chicken","Fantasia"
"101",2487569,2490737,"to hundred-ton nightmares.","Fantasia"
"102",2490822,2492906,"They were not very bright.","Fantasia"
"103",2492991,2495784,"Even the biggest of themhad only the brain of a pigeon.","Fantasia"
"104",2495869,2499329,"They lived in the air and wateras well as on land.","Fantasia"
"105",2499414,2501582,"As a rule, they were vegetarians,","Fantasia"
"106",2501666,2504334,"rather amiableand easy to get along with.","Fantasia"
"107",2504419,2508005,"However, there were bulliesand gangsters among them.","Fantasia"
"108",2508089,2511508,"The worst of the lot,a brute named tyrannosaurus rex,","Fantasia"
"109",2511593,2515387,"was probably the meanest killerthat ever roamed the Earth.","Fantasia"
"110",2516264,2520601,"The dinosaurs were lords of creationfor about 200 million years.","Fantasia"
"111",2520685,2524354,"And then... Well,we don't exactly know what happened.","Fantasia"
"112",2524439,2528442,"Some scientists think thatgreat droughts and earthquakes","Fantasia"
"113",2528526,2531862,"turned the whole worldinto a gigantic dustbowl.","Fantasia"
"114",2531946,2535782,"In any case,the dinosaurs were wiped out.","Fantasia"
"115",2535867,2537826,"That is where our story ends.","Fantasia"
"116",2537911,2541538,"Where it begins is at a timeinfinitely far back,","Fantasia"
"117",2541623,2543707,"when there was no life at all on Earth.","Fantasia"
"118",2543791,2545542,"Nothing but clouds of steam,","Fantasia"
"119",2545627,2549213,"boiling seas and exploding volcanoes.","Fantasia"
"120",2549297,2553258,"So now,imagine yourselves out in space","Fantasia"
"121",2553343,2555844,"billions and billions of years ago,","Fantasia"
"122",2555929,2559306,"looking down on this lonely,tormented little planet,","Fantasia"
"123",2559390,2562351,"spinning throughan empty sea of nothingness.","Fantasia"
"124",3927048,3929925,"And now we'll havea 15-minute intermission.","Fantasia"
"125",4128666,4131043,"Before we get intothe second half of the program,","Fantasia"
"126",4131127,4133587,"I'd like to introduce somebody to you,","Fantasia"
"127",4133671,4136632,"somebody who's very importantto Fantasia.","Fantasia"
"128",4136716,4139051,"He's very shy and very retiring.","Fantasia"
"129",4139135,4142679,"I just happened to run across himone day at the Disney studios.","Fantasia"
"130",4142764,4144681,"But when I did, I suddenly realized","Fantasia"
"131",4144766,4148393,"that here was not only an indispensablemember of the organization,","Fantasia"
"132",4148478,4152147,"but a screen personality whosepossibilities nobody around the place","Fantasia"
"133",4152232,4153524,"had ever noticed.","Fantasia"
"134",4153608,4157694,"And so I'm very happy to havethis opportunity to introduce to you","Fantasia"
"135",4157779,4159738,"the soundtrack.","Fantasia"
"136",4160990,4162491,"All right. Come on.","Fantasia"
"137",4162575,4164952,"That's all right. Don't be timid.","Fantasia"
"138",4167747,4169456,"Atta soundtrack.","Fantasia"
"139",4169541,4172042,"Now, watching him, I discoveredthat every beautiful sound","Fantasia"
"140",4172126,4175045,"also createsan equally beautiful picture.","Fantasia"
"141",4175129,4178924,"Now, look. Will the soundtrackkindly produce a sound?","Fantasia"
"142",4179801,4183428,"Go on, don't be nervous.Go ahead. Any sound.","Fantasia"
"143",4186057,4189643,"Well, that isn't quitewhat I had in mind.","Fantasia"
"144",4190937,4193605,"Suppose we hear and see the harp.","Fantasia"
"145",4213835,4218005,"Now one of the strings, say, the violin.","Fantasia"
"146",4239402,4243155,"And now... now, one of the woodwinds,a flute.","Fantasia"
"147",4249412,4251079,"Very pretty.","Fantasia"
"148",4251164,4254291,"Now, let's have a brass instrument,the trumpet.","Fantasia"
"149",4271684,4276021,"All right. Now, how abouta low instrument, the bassoon?","Fantasia"
"150",4286574,4290160,"Go on. Go on.Drop the other shoe, will you?","Fantasia"
"151",4295583,4299378,"Well, now to finish, suppose we seesome of the percussion instruments,","Fantasia"
"152",4299462,4301505,"beginning with the bass drum.","Fantasia"
"153",4327573,4329741,"Thanks a lot, old man.","Fantasia"
"154",4335707,4338709,"The symphony that Beethovencalled the Pastoral,","Fantasia"
"155",4338793,4342337,"his sixth, is one of the few piecesof music he ever wrote","Fantasia"
"156",4342422,4344673,"that tells somethinglike a definite story.","Fantasia"
"157",4344757,4347676,"He was a great nature lover,and in this symphony,","Fantasia"
"158",4347760,4350846,"he paints a musical pictureof a day in the country.","Fantasia"
"159",4350930,4352931,"Now, of course,the country that Beethoven described","Fantasia"
"160",4353016,4355684,"was the countrysidewith which he was familiar.","Fantasia"
"161",4355768,4358520,"But his music coversa much wider field than that,","Fantasia"
"162",4358604,4362566,"so Walt Disney has given the PastoralSymphony a mythological setting.","Fantasia"
"163",4362650,4367070,"And that setting is of Mt. Olympus,the abode of the gods.","Fantasia"
"164",4367155,4370532,"And here, first of all,we meet a group of fabulous creatures","Fantasia"
"165",4370616,4372451,"of the field and forest,","Fantasia"
"166",4372535,4376538,"unicorns, fauns,Pegasus, the flying horse,","Fantasia"
"167",4376622,4379291,"and his entire family,the centaurs,","Fantasia"
"168",4379375,4383795,"those strange creaturesthat are half-man and half-horse.","Fantasia"
"169",4383880,4386882,"And their girlfriends,the centaur-ettes.","Fantasia"
"170",4386966,4390177,"Later on, we meet our old friend,Bacchus, the god ofwine,","Fantasia"
"171",4390261,4392387,"presiding over a bacchanal.","Fantasia"
"172",4392472,4394347,"The party is interrupted by a storm.","Fantasia"
"173",4394432,4397100,"And now, we see Vulcanforging thunderbolts","Fantasia"
"174",4397185,4400145,"and handing them over to theking of all the gods, Zeus,","Fantasia"
"175",4400229,4402397,"who plays darts with them.","Fantasia"
"176",4402482,4406234,"As the storm clears, we see Iris,the goddess of the rainbow.","Fantasia"
"177",4406319,4410155,"And Apollo, drivinghis sun chariot across the sky.","Fantasia"
"178",4410239,4412199,"And then Morpheus, the god of sleep,","Fantasia"
"179",4412283,4414951,"covers everythingwith his cloak of night,","Fantasia"
"180",4415036,4417996,"as Diana, using the new moon as a bow,","Fantasia"
"181",4418081,4422501,"shoots an arrow of firethat spangles the sky with stars.","Fantasia"
"182",5772725,5776812,"Now we're going to do one of the mostfamous and popular ballets ever written,","Fantasia"
"183",5776896,5780441,"The Dance of the Hoursfrom Ponchielli's opera La Gioconda.","Fantasia"
"184",5780525,5783193,"It's a pageant of the hours of the day.","Fantasia"
"185",5783278,5786447,"We see first a groupof dancers in costumes","Fantasia"
"186",5786531,5788824,"to suggest the delicate light of dawn.","Fantasia"
"187",5788908,5790367,"Then a second group enters","Fantasia"
"188",5790452,5793537,"dressed to representthe brilliant light of noon day.","Fantasia"
"189",5793621,5796331,"As these withdraw, a third group enters","Fantasia"
"190",5796416,5800878,"in costumes that suggestthe delicate tones of early evening.","Fantasia"
"191",5800962,5805549,"Then a last group, all in black,the somber hours of the night.","Fantasia"
"192",5805633,5808302,"Suddenly, the orchestrabursts into a brilliant finale","Fantasia"
"193",5808386,5813140,"in which the hours of darknessare overcome by the hours of light.","Fantasia"
"194",5813224,5817019,"All this takes place in the great hallwith its garden beyond,","Fantasia"
"195",5817103,5820772,"of the palace of Duke Alvise,a Venetian nobleman.","Fantasia"
"196",6563974,6566434,"The last number on our Fantasia program","Fantasia"
"197",6566518,6569562,"is a combination of two piecesof music so utterly different","Fantasia"
"198",6569647,6574234,"in construction and moodthat they set each other off perfectly.","Fantasia"
"199",6574318,6576736,"The firstis A Night on Bald Mountain,","Fantasia"
"200",6576820,6580907,"by one of Russia's greatest composers,Modest Mussorgsky.","Fantasia"

"202",6585162,6587956,"Musically and dramatically,we have here a picture","Fantasia"

"204",6590668,6593419,"Bald Mountain, according to tradition,","Fantasia"
"205",6593504,6596756,"is the gathering placeof Satan and his followers.","Fantasia"

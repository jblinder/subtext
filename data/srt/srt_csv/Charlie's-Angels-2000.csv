"626",3766590,3768930,"Knox thinks CharIie killed his father.","Charlie's Angels"
"627",3769850,3772350,"So if he can intercept Charlie's call--","Charlie's Angels"
"628",3772680,3774180,"He can Iocate him.","Charlie's Angels"
"629",3774430,3777600,"But Knox has to get Charlie on the phone first.","Charlie's Angels"

"9",56079,59981,"with a vain and greedyking to rule over them.","Maleficent"
"10",60200,62158,"They were forever discontent,","Maleficent"
"11",62159,65789,"and envious of the wealthand beauty of their neighbors.","Maleficent"
"12",66239,68879,"For in the other kingdom, the Moors,","Maleficent"
"13",68879,73510,"lived every manner of strangeand wonderful creature.","Maleficent"
"14",73799,76359,"And they needed neitherking nor queen,","Maleficent"
"15",76359,78510,"but trusted in one another.","Maleficent"
"16",80680,84319,"In a great tree on agreat cliff in the Moors","Maleficent"
"17",84319,86799,"lived one such spirit.","Maleficent"
"18",86799,90269,"You might take her for a girl,","Maleficent"
"19",90280,93862,"but she was not just any girl.","Maleficent"
"20",94000,96866,"She was a fairy.","Maleficent"
"21",124200,126224,"There you go.","Maleficent"
"22",126719,128598,"And her name","Maleficent"
"23",128599,130465,"was Maleficent.","Maleficent"

"45",234639,236478,"I'm not afraid.","Maleficent"

"47",240840,242501,"Come out!","Maleficent"
"48",242520,245438,"No. They mean to kill me.","Maleficent"
"49",245439,248419,"And besides, they'rehideous to look at.","Maleficent"
"50",249400,251469,"That's extremely rude.","Maleficent"
"51",251719,255508,"Don't listen to him, Balthazar.You're classically handsome.","Maleficent"
"52",257680,259519,"It's not right to steal,","Maleficent"

"58",281639,284302,"I believe he's just a boy.","Maleficent"
"59",284360,286463,"And you're just a girl.","Maleficent"
"60",287040,288238,"I think.","Maleficent"
"61",288240,289740,"Who are you?","Maleficent"
"62",289879,291745,"I'm called Stefan.","Maleficent"
"63",292040,293540,"Who are you?","Maleficent"
"64",293680,295261,"I'm Maleficent.","Maleficent"
"65",298480,300310,"Yes, right.","Maleficent"
"66",301240,302901,"You have to give it back.","Maleficent"
"67",303319,304946,"Give what back?","Maleficent"
"68",325560,329319,"If I knew you would throw itaway, I would have kept it.","Maleficent"
"69",329319,331079,"I didn't throw it away.","Maleficent"
"70",331079,334584,"I delivered it home,as I'm going to do for you.","Maleficent"
"71",338439,341079,"Someday, you know, I'll live there.","Maleficent"
"72",341079,343389,"In the castle.","Maleficent"
"73",346600,348465,"Where do you live now?","Maleficent"
"74",349639,351141,"In a barn.","Maleficent"
"75",351360,353624,"So your parents are farmers, then?","Maleficent"
"76",354279,356781,"My parents are dead.","Maleficent"
"77",358639,360266,"Mine, too.","Maleficent"
"78",364319,366079,"We'll see each other again.","Maleficent"
"79",366079,368598,"You really shouldn't comeback here, you know.","Maleficent"
"80",368600,370670,"It's not safe.","Maleficent"
"81",373639,374879,"And if I made that choice,","Maleficent"
"82",374879,377269,"if I came back, would you be here?","Maleficent"
"83",378759,380307,"Perhaps.","Maleficent"
"84",383839,386103,"- What's wrong?- Your ring.","Maleficent"
"85",386480,388358,"Iron burns fairies.","Maleficent"
"86",388360,389906,"I'm sorry.","Maleficent"
"87",396800,398983,"I like your wings.","Maleficent"
"88",400399,404319,"Maleficent thought of howStefan cast away his ring,","Maleficent"
"89",404319,406798,"he who had so little in the world,","Maleficent"
"90",406800,409268,"so that their handsmight touch again,","Maleficent"
"91",409720,412838,"and her heart was moved.","Maleficent"
"92",412840,415999,"Thus did the young thief whohad hoped to steal a jewel...","Maleficent"
"93",416000,417079,"Maleficent!","Maleficent"
"94",417079,419959,"steal something far more precious.","Maleficent"
"95",419959,422029,"Maleficent?","Maleficent"
"96",424360,426065,"Maleficent!","Maleficent"
"97",430360,431999,"After all these weeks,","Maleficent"
"98",432000,433990,"look who came back.","Maleficent"
"99",435480,437981,"I thought it worth the risk.","Maleficent"
"100",438040,440906,"So, what do you do for fun?","Maleficent"
"101",450040,454625,"Stefan and Maleficent becamethe most unlikely of friends.","Maleficent"
"102",454680,458718,"And for a time it seemedas if, in them at least,","Maleficent"
"103",458720,463305,"the old hatred between men andfairies had been forgotten.","Maleficent"
"104",463759,468389,"As it will, friendship slowlyturned into something else.","Maleficent"
"105",474920,477399,"And on her 16th birthday,","Maleficent"
"106",477399,480266,"Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.","Maleficent"
"107",482120,485225,"He told her it was true love's kiss.","Maleficent"
"108",487879,490348,"But it was not to be.","Maleficent"
"109",491920,496798,"As the years passed, Stefan's ambitionpulled him away from Maleficent,","Maleficent"
"110",496800,501100,"and towards the temptationsof the human kingdom.","Maleficent"
"111",501199,504278,"While Maleficent,the strongest of the fairies,","Maleficent"
"112",504279,507750,"rose to become theprotector of the Moors.","Maleficent"
"113",554720,557158,"Maleficent often wandered alone","Maleficent"
"114",557159,560639,"and sometimes wonderedwhere Stefan might be,","Maleficent"
"115",560639,564542,"for she had never understoodthe greed and envy of men.","Maleficent"
"116",565279,567748,"But she was to learn.","Maleficent"
"117",568000,572158,"For the human king had heardof a growing power in the Moors,","Maleficent"
"118",572159,575584,"and he sought to strike it down.","Maleficent"
"119",596120,598462,"Guard, halt!","Maleficent"
"120",599000,601149,"Guard, halt!","Maleficent"
"121",611759,613705,"There they are,","Maleficent"
"122",614039,618198,"the mysterious Moors whereno one dares to venture","Maleficent"
"123",618200,622022,"for fear of the magicalcreatures that lurk within.","Maleficent"
"124",622120,624621,"Well, I say crush them!","Maleficent"
"125",644120,646748,"Go no further!","Maleficent"
"126",648000,649639,"A king","Maleficent"
"127",649639,653780,"does not take ordersfrom a winged elf.","Maleficent"
"128",656240,659822,"You are no king to me.","Maleficent"
"129",665960,668746,"- Bring me her head.- Battalion!","Maleficent"
"130",672720,674301,"Advance!","Maleficent"

"132",687279,689269,"Hold the line!","Maleficent"
"133",701600,704546,"- It's the dark creatures!- It's the dark creatures!","Maleficent"

"136",790200,791905,"To the king!","Maleficent"
"137",798759,800438,"You will not have the Moors!","Maleficent"
"138",800440,802863,"Not now, nor ever!","Maleficent"
"139",802879,804380,"You...","Maleficent"
"140",842559,845505,"When I ascended to the throne,","Maleficent"
"141",846720,849745,"I promised the people","Maleficent"
"142",849799,852985,"one day we would take","Maleficent"
"143",853440,856419,"the Moors and its treasures.","Maleficent"
"144",857120,859110,"Each of you","Maleficent"
"145",859399,864780,"swore allegiance tome and to that cause.","Maleficent"
"146",870799,872380,"Your Majesty.","Maleficent"
"147",875639,878268,"Defeated in battle.","Maleficent"
"148",878360,881989,"Is this to be my legacy?","Maleficent"
"149",882120,886147,"I see you waiting for me to die.","Maleficent"
"150",886440,890068,"It won't be long. But what then?","Maleficent"
"151",890120,892509,"I will choose a successor","Maleficent"
"152",892720,896349,"to take the throne andcare for my daughter.","Maleficent"
"153",897399,899105,"Who among you","Maleficent"
"154",899519,901828,"is worthy?","Maleficent"
"155",902279,905399,"Kill the winged creature.","Maleficent"

"159",941600,944067,"Maleficent!","Maleficent"
"160",951240,954710,"So, how is life with the humans?","Maleficent"
"161",957159,960678,"Maleficent, I've come to warn you.","Maleficent"

"165",975399,977759,"They spoke of many things,","Maleficent"
"166",977759,980024,"and the years faded away.","Maleficent"
"167",980879,985828,"And she forgave Stefanhis folly and his ambition,","Maleficent"

"572",2930759,2934304,"Not quite.The police theory this afternoon was this,","The Woman in the Window"
"573",2934387,2936514,"Mazard, a bachelor, had a sweetheart.","The Woman in the Window"
"574",2936598,2938058,"His business associatesare quite sure of that.","The Woman in the Window"
"575",2938141,2940310,"But who she is or where she lives,they don't know.","The Woman in the Window"
"576",2940393,2942395,"Pretty nervous man in romance, it seems.","The Woman in the Window"
"577",2942479,2944064,"At any rate,when he reached Penn Station,","The Woman in the Window"
"578",2944105,2945398,"he went to call on her.","The Woman in the Window"
"579",2945440,2948860,"Either a man was already thereor he came during Mazard's visit.","The Woman in the Window"
"580",2948943,2951946,"And this man the lady preferredover Mazard.","The Woman in the Window"
"581",2952822,2954240,"Why do they think that?","The Woman in the Window"
"582",2954324,2955950,"Well, otherwise,if her true love had been killed,","The Woman in the Window"
"583",2956034,2958453,"she would have most likely donesomething to bring the killer to justice.","The Woman in the Window"
"584",2958536,2961456,"- This is just a theory, of course?- I said that.","The Woman in the Window"
"585",2961539,2964834,"So they fought and Mazard was killed,probably with a pair of scissors.","The Woman in the Window"
"586",2964918,2967045,"That's the medical examiner's belief,anyway.","The Woman in the Window"
"587",2967128,2970382,"Then in a panic, they loaded the bodyinto a car, his or hers,","The Woman in the Window"
"588",2970465,2973051,"and took it to the placewhere it was found.","The Woman in the Window"
"589",2973134,2976679,"Now these two people,this man and this woman,","The Woman in the Window"

"594",2989192,2991611,"That, I said, was the theory this afternoon.","The Woman in the Window"

"596",2996032,3000245,"Well, now it's anybody's guess.Something came up just as I left the office","The Woman in the Window"
"597",3000328,3002789,"that pulls the rug right outfrom under that theory.","The Woman in the Window"
"598",3002872,3004165,"Really?","The Woman in the Window"
"599",3004249,3005667,"It seems that Mazard's associates,","The Woman in the Window"
"600",3005708,3007460,"always afraid he'd get into troublewith his temper,","The Woman in the Window"
"601",3007544,3011840,"had engaged a man, a bodyguard,to follow him secretly at all times.","The Woman in the Window"

"605",3023143,3025520,"Then why hasn't he shown up?","The Woman in the Window"
"606",3026187,3029357,"It's not that simple.He could have murdered Mazard, yes.","The Woman in the Window"
"607",3029399,3031818,"He might have tried to blackmail himand killed him in the fight.","The Woman in the Window"
"608",3031901,3033027,"Or he might have witnessed the killing","The Woman in the Window"
"609",3033069,3034779,"and is getting readyto blackmail the killers.","The Woman in the Window"
"610",3034863,3038158,"But even if he's 100% innocent,he still won't walk in and talk.","The Woman in the Window"
"611",3038199,3039409,"Why not?","The Woman in the Window"
"612",3039492,3042287,"Because he's hot. He's a known crookwith a blackmailing record.","The Woman in the Window"
"613",3042328,3045498,"That's why he was thrown off the force,for shaking people down.","The Woman in the Window"
"614",3045540,3047584,"He's wanted for at least two other raps.","The Woman in the Window"
"615",3047667,3050920,"We'll get that gentlemanwhen we run him down and not before.","The Woman in the Window"

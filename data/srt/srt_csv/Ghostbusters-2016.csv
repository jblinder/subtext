"3",79439,81010,"At the time of its construction,","Ghostbusters"
"4",81120,83326,"it was one of the mostelegant homes in existence.","Ghostbusters"
"5",83760,87560,"Um, interesting fact.This grandfather clock was on the Titanic","Ghostbusters"
"6",87640,89722,"and was saved by Sir Aldridge.","Ghostbusters"
"7",90159,93209,"A Romanian woman and her child wereforced to leave the lifeboat to make room.","Ghostbusters"
"8",94319,96209,"Uh, over here,","Ghostbusters"
"9",96319,100609,"you can imagine Sir Aldridgeentertaining his wealthy guests.","Ghostbusters"
"10",100680,105811,"It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnumfirst had the idea to enslave elephants.","Ghostbusters"
"11",106560,108210,"And if you'll follow me...","Ghostbusters"
"12",112640,117043,"Now, I'm gonna tell yousomething a little spooky.","Ghostbusters"
"13",117560,122805,"On the morning of October 25th, 1894,Sir Aldridge awoke, furious,","Ghostbusters"
"14",122879,124847,"when his breakfast was not waiting for him.","Ghostbusters"
"15",124920,128765,"So he called to his servants,but none of them responded.","Ghostbusters"
"16",129439,130646,"Why?","Ghostbusters"
"17",131879,135850,"Because, during the night, one by one,","Ghostbusters"
"18",135919,139366,"they had each been stabbed to deathin their sleep.","Ghostbusters"
"19",140840,142329,"It was later discovered","Ghostbusters"
"20",142400,146121,"they were murdered by his eldest daughter,","Ghostbusters"
"21",147280,149203,"Gertrude Aldridge.","Ghostbusters"
"22",149280,151247,"Sir Aldridge once wrote in his diary,","Ghostbusters"
"23",151319,153209,"""I know God makes no mistakes,","Ghostbusters"
"24",153599,156888,"""but I believe he may have been drunkwhen he built Gertrude's personality.""","Ghostbusters"
"25",156960,159724,"Now, to spare the family public humiliation,","Ghostbusters"
"26",159800,161961,"instead of turning her in to the police,","Ghostbusters"
"27",162280,165682,"they locked her in this basement.","Ghostbusters"
"28",166280,167645,"And they fed her...","Ghostbusters"
"29",169280,170724,"...through this slot.","Ghostbusters"
"30",170800,174485,"Years later, when a new owner moved in,","Ghostbusters"
"31",174639,176722,"they dug out her remains.","Ghostbusters"
"32",176840,180925,"But, after repeatedly hearing strange sounds,","Ghostbusters"
"33",181360,183044,"he sealed it shut.","Ghostbusters"
"34",183159,187324,"That's right.No one has opened this door since then.","Ghostbusters"
"35",193199,194531,"Okay.","Ghostbusters"
"36",194599,195725,"Follow me.","Ghostbusters"
"37",195840,197682,"Maybe steer clear of the door.","Ghostbusters"
"38",267000,269401,"Sorry, Sir Aldridge. I got to get out of here!","Ghostbusters"
"39",286680,288170,"Oh, Garret, you idiot.","Ghostbusters"

"49",342360,344761,"- Did you hear the news?-Tell me.","Ghostbusters"
"50",344840,347127,"I'm lecturing in the big hall today.","Ghostbusters"
"51",347240,349322,"- Darling, that's wonderful.-I know.","Ghostbusters"
"52",349399,352483,"- This is what you're wearing?-What?","Ghostbusters"
"53",352560,354846,"I have someone I want you to meet.","Ghostbusters"

"60",370160,373129,"Erin just learned she's being published.","Ghostbusters"
"61",373639,375608,"Yes, well, I'm very proud.","Ghostbusters"
"62",375680,378444,"I don't allow my labto submit to journals anymore.","Ghostbusters"
"63",378519,383081,"I think journals tamper with the processand ultimately hurt scientific research.","Ghostbusters"
"64",383160,387848,"Yeah. It's like when scientists get caught up,you know, in those dumb awards.","Ghostbusters"
"65",387920,390571,"- You know...-Oh, awards are massively important.","Ghostbusters"
"66",390639,393404,"Yes, no, I was sayingit'd be dumb not to go after awards,","Ghostbusters"
"67",393480,395562,"'cause that's where science really shines.","Ghostbusters"
"68",395639,399769,"It's, unfortunately, the only wayto draw attention to good science.","Ghostbusters"
"69",399840,401329,"- Excellent point.-Mmm-hmm.","Ghostbusters"
"70",401680,403603,"All right. I should be going.","Ghostbusters"

"76",420120,421201,"Fingers crossed.","Ghostbusters"
"77",421279,423886,"Not that crossing your fingersmeans anything, 'cause it doesn't.","Ghostbusters"
"78",423959,425848,"Oh, I couldn't disagree more.","Ghostbusters"
"79",425920,430369,"It's been proven that superstitionscan have tremendous performance benefits.","Ghostbusters"
"80",430680,433762,"Exactly. I'm wrong about everything.","Ghostbusters"
"81",433839,437127,"All right. Well, I'm gonna try to get outof here without stepping on these cracks.","Ghostbusters"
"82",437199,439850,"I don't want my mom calling me, like...","Ghostbusters"
"83",440399,442971,"Oh, see, when they change direction,you've got to...","Ghostbusters"

"110",511319,512809,"Look, it was a very long time ago,","Ghostbusters"
"111",512879,515086,"and it was just a gagbetween a couple of friends.","Ghostbusters"
"112",515200,516485,"I'm sorry.","Ghostbusters"
"113",516559,518528,"A 460-page gag?","Ghostbusters"

"135",568000,570081,"is really not what it used to be.","Ghostbusters"
"136",570159,574370,"And I would consider getting a referralfrom a more prestigious college.","Ghostbusters"
"137",574440,576249,"More prestigious than Princeton?","Ghostbusters"
"138",576720,577721,"Yes.","Ghostbusters"

"191",731080,732160,"-that does a little dance.-You know what?","Ghostbusters"
"192",732240,734048,"That book was our baby.","Ghostbusters"

"220",802200,803485,"Holtzmann workswith me here in the lab.","Ghostbusters"
"221",803559,807042,"She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal.","Ghostbusters"
"222",807159,809003,"She would not abandon you.","Ghostbusters"
"223",809120,810451,"I get it.","Ghostbusters"
"224",810519,813330,"She also happens to specializein experimental particle physics.","Ghostbusters"
"225",813399,816085,"- Oh.-She was almost hired by CERN.","Ghostbusters"
"226",816159,817446,"That's very impressive.","Ghostbusters"
"227",817519,819169,"Uh, what happened?","Ghostbusters"
"228",819240,821765,"- There was a lab incident.-But he's gonna wake up.","Ghostbusters"

"232",827919,830446,"Um, can we get backto our discussion please?","Ghostbusters"
"233",830519,834161,"Oh, gosh, it sounds like a great time,but I'm gonna have to say no","Ghostbusters"
"234",834240,836322,"because Holtzmann and I are really busy here","Ghostbusters"
"235",836399,839768,"actualizing what we justtheorized about in our book.","Ghostbusters"
"236",839840,840886,"- Really?-Yeah.","Ghostbusters"
"237",840960,844486,"We're incredibly close on the hollow laserfor the reverse tractor beam.","Ghostbusters"

"2269",6783680,6786046,"We gotta cross 'em up,and we've got an extremely good shot","Ghostbusters"
"2270",6786119,6789680,"at pulling all the ionized ecto-matterback into the dimension of its origin.","Ghostbusters"
"2271",6789800,6791927,"So, on the plus side, we save the world.","Ghostbusters"

"2273",6796399,6798448,"Yeah. It's hard to shinethat penny, but yeah.","Ghostbusters"
"2274",6798760,6799761,"Okay.","Ghostbusters"

"2282",6855159,6857765,"Yo, what about that nuclear thingon top of the car?","Ghostbusters"
"2283",6857840,6860844,"If we can get those reactorssuper-critical inside the vortex,","Ghostbusters"

"2285",6863279,6865487,"Causing a total protonic reversal.","Ghostbusters"
"2286",6865560,6867688,"It's gonna turn that portalinto a giant ghost trap.","Ghostbusters"

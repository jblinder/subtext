"93",445050,447730,"{y:i}Or the guy with the porcupine hair?","Father of the Bride"
"94",448650,452730,"{y:i}Or the English teacher,{y:i}that poop-a-doop that Ellie liked?","Father of the Bride"

"96",457690,461170,"{y:i}And she'd never fall{y:i}for that bebop hound.","Father of the Bride"
"97",461850,466930,"{y:i}And it couldn't be that genius who said he'd{y:i}fix my radio. She couldn't do that to me.","Father of the Bride"
"98",468210,471890,"{y:i}Couldn't be the radical.{y:i}She hadn't been on a picket line in years.","Father of the Bride"

"100",475010,476450,"{y:i}Or would she?","Father of the Bride"
"101",477210,479610,"{y:i}She was still going on about him.","Father of the Bride"

"113",518730,521210,"He just won't be pinned down.","Father of the Bride"
"114",523450,528170,"I hope that Buckley won't think I'mtoo nosy if I ask a few simple questions.","Father of the Bride"
"115",529010,531890,"Okay, Pops. I supposewe have to go through this.","Father of the Bride"
"116",532050,535090,"- Seems to me...- Who is this Buckley anyway?","Father of the Bride"

"118",537290,539530,"- I hope it's better than his first.- Listen...","Father of the Bride"
"119",539730,541170,"Where the devil is he from?","Father of the Bride"
"120",541330,544890,"Who does he think will support him?If he thinks I am, he's wrong!","Father of the Bride"
"121",545090,547290,"- I don't give a hoot...- Stanley! Stanley...","Father of the Bride"
"122",547410,552090,"You don't have to shout. Nobody's deaf.It's mortifying with right in there.","Father of the Bride"

"126",559250,561730,"You broke it to meso casually over the ice cream.","Father of the Bride"
"127",561890,564170,"You might'veat least waited until coffee.","Father of the Bride"
"128",564290,567450,"Oh, thanks, Delilah. I'll pour it.","Father of the Bride"

"134",586890,589170,"He's the kind of a personthat's absolutely...","Father of the Bride"
"135",589330,591490,"I mean, absolutely independent.","Father of the Bride"
"136",592290,596810,"Buckley wouldn't come to you for help,not even if we were starving in the gutter.","Father of the Bride"
"137",600240,602320,"And his name is Dunstan.","Father of the Bride"

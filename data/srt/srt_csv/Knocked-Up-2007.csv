"656",1871286,1874121,"But it works out in my advantage,I think, ultimately,","Knocked Up"
"657",1874206,1876207,"'cause I don't have to pay any taxes.","Knocked Up"
"658",1876291,1879585,"So financially that's helpful","Knocked Up"
"659",1879670,1882213,"'cause I don't havea lot of money.","Knocked Up"
"660",1882297,1886425,"You know, I mean, I'm not poor or anything,but I eat a lot of spaghetti.","Knocked Up"

"1396",3831244,3834246,"But, you know, he had this whole spielabout when he has the money,","Knocked Up"
"1397",3834331,3837499,"he's gonna buy me the ring thatI deserve and...","Knocked Up"
"1398",3837584,3839460,"The box was just empty?","Knocked Up"
"1399",3839544,3841712,"I mean, he can't afford a ring, so...","Knocked Up"
"1400",3841796,3844923,"So he got down on one kneeand gave you an empty box?","Knocked Up"
"1401",3845008,3846383,"Yes.","Knocked Up"

"1411",3871701,3873285,"Really? You don't thinkthat would just make it worse?","Knocked Up"
"1412",3873370,3874495,"That'd be, like, naggy.","Knocked Up"
"1413",3874579,3876997,"And then in the end,they thank you for it.","Knocked Up"
"1414",3877874,3880459,"You can't commit to him. You can'tmake a commitment to him.","Knocked Up"
"1415",3880543,3884421,"You don't even know him. I don't evenknow Pete after 10 years.","Knocked Up"

"1126",5302546,5303890,"How did you feelwhen you saw that light?","Phenomenon"
"1127",5304006,5305680,"I think you know morethan you're telling us!","Phenomenon"
"1128",5305759,5307476,"- Now, imagine if you will...- What'd the aliens look like?","Phenomenon"

"1145",5404149,5406447,"Oh, I found my pace.","Phenomenon"
"1146",5407152,5410907,"Simple thing really. Hard to explain.","Phenomenon"
"1147",5410988,5412740,"Why, you figure I'm too thick?","Phenomenon"
"1148",5412823,5416498,"What I figure about you isthat you're stalling.","Phenomenon"
"1149",5418537,5421542,"I'm not stalling though. I'm waiting.","Phenomenon"
"1150",5422626,5425345,"- For what?- Reinforcements.","Phenomenon"
"1151",5433677,5436305,"Well, you pick good people.","Phenomenon"
"1152",5437681,5439024,"You bet.","Phenomenon"
"1153",5443188,5444484,"See...","Phenomenon"
"1154",5446315,5448033,"George, George.","Phenomenon"
"1155",5450362,5455243,"There's a tumor in your brainthat's spread out like a hand.","Phenomenon"
"1156",5455658,5457957,"Threads of it, you know, everywhere.","Phenomenon"
"1157",5458036,5461289,"But instead of dysfunction...Now here's the mystery, George.","Phenomenon"
"1158",5461372,5464171,"Instead of destroying brain function,","Phenomenon"
"1159",5465210,5466712,"so far, it's been stimulating it.","Phenomenon"
"1160",5466836,5469965,"And we can't understand that.","Phenomenon"
"1161",5470047,5475145,"You have more area of active brain usethan anybody ever tested. Ever.","Phenomenon"
"1162",5475220,5477221,"Because of those tentacles.","Phenomenon"
"1163",5477346,5479189,"I mean, we've seentumors like this before.","Phenomenon"
"1164",5479265,5481484,"It's called astrocytomas,","Phenomenon"
"1165",5481559,5488533,"and it explains the dizzinessand the illusion of light.","Phenomenon"
"1166",5489900,5493576,"But the way it's in there,waking up areas of the brain,","Phenomenon"
"1167",5493697,5498748,"it's a big mystery.","Phenomenon"
"1168",5499743,5500961,"So...","Phenomenon"
"1169",5501871,5503793,"And it's killing me.","Phenomenon"
"1170",5503914,5505632,"- Well...- For sure?","Phenomenon"
"1171",5509878,5511676,"We got a call fromthe best brain man in the country.","Phenomenon"
"1172",5511756,5514384,"I mean, actually,he's one of the best in the world.","Phenomenon"
"1173",5514466,5516970,"He's gonna study your testsand then talk to you.","Phenomenon"
"1174",5517095,5518220,"Hmm.","Phenomenon"
"1175",5518304,5519555,"But...","Phenomenon"
"1176",5521306,5522934,"The blood flow is in danger now,","Phenomenon"
"1177",5523059,5528782,"and you're gonna start to weaken,maybe black out.","Phenomenon"
"1178",5530774,5532823,"We really don't know. It's...","Phenomenon"
"1179",5532944,5536288,"But it's a damn lousy scenario,you see'?","Phenomenon"
"1180",5541077,5543454,"Let me sit down here a minute.","Phenomenon"
"1181",5548667,5550136,"God damn it!","Phenomenon"
"1182",5552588,5554636,"Something happenedabout 25 years ago","Phenomenon"
"1183",5554757,5557386,"when you broke your legand I set it, George.","Phenomenon"
"1184",5557469,5560221,"I don't know what to call it,","Phenomenon"
"1185",5560305,5563479,"but somehow you got into my heartmore than most.","Phenomenon"
"1186",5565268,5566645,"And for...","Phenomenon"
"1187",5570648,5572992,"And for a manwho's never been a father,","Phenomenon"
"1188",5573109,5575658,"I sure feel like I'm losing a son.","Phenomenon"
"1189",5576820,5577993,"Yeah.","Phenomenon"
"1190",5580617,5583996,"Georgie. Yeah.","Phenomenon"
"1191",5590292,5593887,"Can I do something for you, George?Anything?","Phenomenon"
"1192",5594005,5595131,"Yes.","Phenomenon"
"1193",5595506,5598511,"Next spring,when you plant the south 40,","Phenomenon"
"1194",5599469,5601971,"I want you to use the new fertilizer.","Phenomenon"
"1195",5602055,5604604,"I want you to put corn in that field,and I know what you're thinking.","Phenomenon"
"1196",5604681,5608231,"You're thinking that it'sjust too tough a crop. But it's not.","Phenomenon"
"1197",5608353,5612654,"I'm telling you, you'll getfour to five years without rotation.","Phenomenon"
"1198",5612731,5615735,"- Now, trust me on this.- Hey.","Phenomenon"
"1199",5619238,5622708,"- I'm gonna wait outside.- Okay.","Phenomenon"
"1200",5622826,5628252,"- Doc, you wanna come with?- Yeah. Okay.","Phenomenon"
"1201",5630207,5631551,"Bye, Doc.","Phenomenon"
"1202",5640885,5645060,"Now, he didn't say how long.","Phenomenon"
"1203",5649351,5651695,"Days or weeks.","Phenomenon"
"1204",5652438,5655032,"They don't... They don't know.","Phenomenon"
"1205",5655108,5656951,"I'm so sorry, Lace.","Phenomenon"
"1206",5660279,5662623,"I know how you hate surprises.","Phenomenon"
"1207",5663615,5666289,"I tried so hard not to love you.","Phenomenon"
"1208",5666411,5668755,"- How'd you make out?- Terrible.","Phenomenon"
"1209",5672792,5676762,"Hey, would you love methe rest of my life'?","Phenomenon"
"1210",5677380,5681260,"No. I'm gonna love youfor the rest of mine.","Phenomenon"
"1211",5706117,5709667,"George Malley? I'm Dr. Wellin.","Phenomenon"
"1212",5711456,5714380,"George, I'm recording thisbecause I'm going to be asking you","Phenomenon"
"1213",5714458,5718430,"some very important questions.You ready?","Phenomenon"
"1214",5719087,5721466,"- Not another test.- No.","Phenomenon"
"1215",5721548,5725895,"No, no. No more tests. A dialog.","Phenomenon"
"1216",5727471,5729145,"I'm going to ask for your permission","Phenomenon"
"1217",5729224,5732649,"for my team to performopen-brain surgery.","Phenomenon"
"1218",5732769,5736739,"But I don't want you to answertill we've had our dialog, all right?","Phenomenon"
"1219",5736814,5739158,"But you said that this tumorwas inoperable.","Phenomenon"
"1220",5739317,5743662,"I think the odds are very small,say, 1 in 500,","Phenomenon"
"1221",5743779,5745657,"that we'd be able to removeenough of the tumor","Phenomenon"
"1222",5745782,5748251,"- to even prolong your life.- Well, why...","Phenomenon"
"1223",5748326,5750420,"But what I want to explain is","Phenomenon"
"1224",5750494,5753998,"that this would not bea life-saving operation.","Phenomenon"
"1225",5754957,5760260,"This would be... Call it an expedition.","Phenomenon"
"1226",5761797,5764926,"This would be a voyage of discovery.","Phenomenon"
"1227",5765760,5768684,"You're in a positionto contribute as much to our knowledge","Phenomenon"
"1228",5768805,5771979,"as any man or womanwho's come before you.","Phenomenon"
"1229",5774310,5777439,"And if you were to waitand do this operation","Phenomenon"
"1230",5777521,5780024,"after I'm done with my brain,what would...","Phenomenon"
"1231",5780149,5782777,"If that's what you want, yes,an autopsy,","Phenomenon"
"1232",5782859,5785703,"- that's all we'll do.- But it wouldn't be as useful.","Phenomenon"
"1233",5785822,5790042,"The study of a living,active brain would tell us volumes.","Phenomenon"
"1234",5790158,5793037,"All right, so if you were to do thisoperation, wouldn't it most likely kill me","Phenomenon"
"1235",5793162,5795130,"or at least shorten my life?","Phenomenon"
"1236",5795206,5799461,"George, I'm asking you to tryand see the larger picture...","Phenomenon"
"1237",5799543,5800841,"Mmm-hmm.","Phenomenon"
"1238",5801003,5803301,"...To realize what you have to offer to us,","Phenomenon"
"1239",5803381,5806225,"the ones you're leaving behind.","Phenomenon"
"1240",5806341,5810063,"You could beour greatest teacher, George, hmm?","Phenomenon"
"1241",5811305,5814560,"I can be your biographer, in a sense.","Phenomenon"
"1242",5814641,5818988,"- I can present you to the world.- But that's not me.","Phenomenon"
"1243",5819063,5822488,"That's just my brain.Do you understand?","Phenomenon"
"1244",5822567,5825319,"Look, Doctor, you know,I might just have something to say","Phenomenon"
"1245",5825403,5828828,"in my last few hours.I just might have something to say.","Phenomenon"
"1246",5828905,5831750,"What you're saying is thatI have something to teach.","Phenomenon"
"1247",5831868,5835247,"And yet you're willing to end meto study my brain under a microscope.","Phenomenon"
"1248",5835371,5836917,"Now, is that all I'm here for?","Phenomenon"
"1249",5836997,5838591,"What else? You're not a scholar or a...","Phenomenon"
"1250",5838666,5841340,"I'll tell you what I am, okay?I'll tell you what I think I am.","Phenomenon"
"1251",5841418,5843011,"I think I'm what everybody can be.","Phenomenon"
"1252",5843087,5844930,"Everyone with a malignant, tentacled...","Phenomenon"
"1253",5845006,5849351,"No, no, no. No, no, it's...That just helped me get here, okay?","Phenomenon"

"1294",5992360,5996240,"You know why?Because he bought her chairs.","Phenomenon"
"1295",5996323,5998372,"That's pretty smart to me.","Phenomenon"
"1296",5999577,6001750,"You ever buy Lisa's chairs?","Phenomenon"

"1304",6029356,6031451,"Doc's making no sense tonight.","Phenomenon"
"1305",6031525,6034074,"Yeah. Maybe he caught it from George.","Phenomenon"

"1001",3479574,3482173,"Well, on the one hand,it would explain the hairs.","Spinning Man"
"1002",3482175,3484275,"On the other hand, it wouldconnect you to a missing girl.","Spinning Man"
"1003",3484277,3486280,"- Look, I'll call you later.- Yeah, okay.","Spinning Man"
"1004",3498458,3499527,"Where I grew up,","Spinning Man"

"1021",3547974,3550878,"when you consider it,we're in the same racket.","Spinning Man"
"1022",3551478,3552914,"What racket is that?","Spinning Man"
"1023",3553146,3555885,"Proof, searching for the truth.","Spinning Man"
"1024",3557418,3562391,"Truth hides behind arguments,analysis, reasoning.","Spinning Man"
"1025",3563224,3567358,"Well, reason leads us to the truth.It doesn't conceal it.","Spinning Man"

"1031",3586313,3587349,"What chair?","Spinning Man"
"1032",3595489,3596621,"Where did you go to school?","Spinning Man"
"1033",3596623,3599360,"Oh, bachelor's at Seton Hall.","Spinning Man"
"1034",3600460,3601597,"JD at Fordham.","Spinning Man"
"1035",3602463,3603365,"A lawyer?","Spinning Man"
"1036",3604065,3605099,"Did you practice?","Spinning Man"
"1037",3605699,3607969,"I did my timein the DA's office.","Spinning Man"
"1038",3608235,3609405,"Wasn't my kind of thing.","Spinning Man"
"1039",3610972,3612407,"They wouldn't let youcarry a gun.","Spinning Man"
"1040",3617744,3619380,"That's my youngest, Katie.","Spinning Man"
"1041",3620581,3622414,"She goes to school with Joyce.","Spinning Man"
"1042",3622416,3623920,"They don't knoweach other, though.","Spinning Man"
"1043",3624751,3627021,"Different circles.","Spinning Man"
"1044",3628222,3630188,"Well, you know,we almost put her","Spinning Man"
"1045",3630190,3632460,"through that summer programof yours at Addison,","Spinning Man"
"1046",3632659,3634295,"you know,the one Joyce went through.","Spinning Man"
"1047",3635097,3638297,"Who knows?They may have become friends.","Spinning Man"
"1048",3638300,3639534,"Well, it's a large program.","Spinning Man"
"1049",3640233,3641936,"Not everybodyknows everybody else.","Spinning Man"
"1050",3642436,3644606,"Including the teachersand the... the students?","Spinning Man"
"1051",3645539,3647539,"Are you questioning meoutside counsel, Detective?","Spinning Man"
"1052",3647541,3649108,"Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of it.","Spinning Man"
"1053",3649110,3651309,"No, I just want to knowthat, you know,","Spinning Man"
"1054",3651311,3654246,"if Katie had gone there, would she havegotten to know all her professors?","Spinning Man"
"1055",3654248,3656081,"Uh, not necessarily.","Spinning Man"
"1056",3656083,3657985,"The students are limitedto three classes,","Spinning Man"
"1057",3658619,3660489,"and there are 15 instructors.","Spinning Man"
"1058",3661322,3663255,"That's not to saycontact's unimaginable.","Spinning Man"
"1059",3663257,3665360,"Really? In what way?","Spinning Man"
"1060",3666559,3670028,"Well, one could imagineKatie, for example,","Spinning Man"
"1061",3670030,3674436,"being caught in a rainstorm,uh, with a few friends,","Spinning Man"
"1062",3675268,3676635,"two other girls and a boy,","Spinning Man"
"1063",3676637,3680172,"and perhaps a, uh,professor offers them","Spinning Man"
"1064",3680175,3683077,"a ride from the libraryto the student union,","Spinning Man"
"1065",3683411,3686648,"and, uh, perhaps while Katie'sin the back of the car, she...","Spinning Man"
"1066",3687114,3691382,"she fixes up her makeup and... and maybebrushes back some of her wet hair...","Spinning Man"
"1067",3691385,3693818,"- Mm-hmm.- inadvertently leaving a strand or two","Spinning Man"
"1068",3693820,3697458,"in the professor'snotoriously unkempt car.","Spinning Man"
"1069",3698224,3700726,"Would that qualifyas getting to know somebody?","Spinning Man"
"1070",3700728,3701760,"No, I don't think it would,","Spinning Man"
"1071",3701762,3703829,"but if I read her diary","Spinning Man"
"1072",3703831,3706365,"and it mentioned an older manshe'd met that summer,","Spinning Man"
"1073",3706367,3709672,"I'd want to have words with everyguy she so much as bumped into.","Spinning Man"
"1074",3710570,3712704,"You readyour daughter's diary?","Spinning Man"
"1075",3712706,3714010,"Every page.","Spinning Man"
"1076",3716811,3720682,"Before I forget,I found these in your glove box.","Spinning Man"
"1077",3721181,3722784,"I wanted to make sureyou got them back.","Spinning Man"
"1078",3724552,3725483,"What is it?","Spinning Man"
"1079",3725485,3726487,"You tell me.","Spinning Man"
"1080",3729757,3732324,"I suppose you thinkI met Joyce Bonner","Spinning Man"
"1081",3732327,3734525,"at the Sanders Hotelfountain at 7:00?","Spinning Man"
"1082",3734527,3736731,"No. The Sanders is in Chicago.","Spinning Man"
"1083",3737331,3740101,"Was, anyway. Closed downabout four years ago.","Spinning Man"
"1084",3741202,3743103,"That would have made Joyce 13,","Spinning Man"
"1085",3745106,3746507,"and I don't thinkyou're that kind of guy.","Spinning Man"
"1086",3747474,3749474,"I mean, at first,I thought it was garbage,","Spinning Man"
"1087",3749476,3750675,"but then you bought this car","Spinning Man"
"1088",3750677,3752543,"here about three years ago,","Spinning Man"
"1089",3752545,3754346,"and I know you don't smoke,","Spinning Man"
"1090",3754347,3756215,"so I just figuredyou were holding on to them","Spinning Man"
"1091",3756217,3757782,"for sentimental reasons.","Spinning Man"
"1092",3757784,3760487,"Shouldn't this be in oneof your fancy evidence bags?","Spinning Man"
"1093",3761356,3762257,"Should it?","Spinning Man"
"1094",3763657,3764726,"Whose writing is it?","Spinning Man"
"1095",3765126,3765891,"I have no idea.","Spinning Man"
"1096",3765893,3766891,"Is it your wife's?","Spinning Man"
"1097",3766893,3768128,"No, it's not.","Spinning Man"
"1098",3768496,3769632,"It doesn't appear to be.","Spinning Man"
"1099",3769829,3771699,"- Would you slow down?- It looks feminine,","Spinning Man"
"1100",3773568,3778505,"the way the lettersare all round, almost touching.","Spinning Man"
"1101",3779873,3783411,"You know, when a guygoes through AA,","Spinning Man"
"1102",3783677,3785447,"he carries a coinaround with him,","Spinning Man"
"1103",3785914,3787414,"reminds him not to drink.","Spinning Man"
"1104",3788715,3790182,"Seems pretty natural,","Spinning Man"
"1105",3790184,3791320,"the way you'refiddling with those.","Spinning Man"
"1106",3791585,3793320,"Could you stopthe goddamn car?","Spinning Man"
"1107",3804532,3806367,"You have to knowwhere this is headed.","Spinning Man"
"1108",3810137,3811673,"Would you take meto my car, please?","Spinning Man"
"1109",3816911,3818146,"Hey, Frank!","Spinning Man"

"1123",3909003,3911639,"One can, but I have the feelingthat one isn't.","Spinning Man"
"1124",3918378,3919880,"I want youto tell me the truth.","Spinning Man"

"1135",3944637,3946672,"I could explain this to you,","Spinning Man"

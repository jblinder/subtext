"12",110643,113168,"You may have other namesfor your streets...","Boomerang!"

"22",143943,146844,"a man knownand loved by all.","Boomerang!"
"23",146913,149211,"You might find him almostany evening on Main Street...","Boomerang!"
"24",149282,152012,"taking his constitutionalafter supper.","Boomerang!"
"25",152085,155543,"A cheerful, kindly figurewith a friendly word for everyone.","Boomerang!"

"40",237036,240096," It seems incredible,but in your town and my town...","Boomerang!"
"41",240173,242698,"these things actually happen.","Boomerang!"
"42",242775,245005,"Life is pleasant and a little dull...","Boomerang!"
"43",245078,249105,"and night after night, we yawn,flick off the radio and go to bed.","Boomerang!"
"44",249182,251173,"Then one morning,black headlines stare at us.","Boomerang!"
"45",251251,255210,"A war is declared,the stock market crashes...","Boomerang!"
"46",255288,258689,"or a kindly old manis shot down on the street...","Boomerang!"
"47",258758,262353,"and the quiet pool of community lifeis suddenly stirred up.","Boomerang!"
"48",262428,267365,"Its waters boil, and its quiet currentstwist in new and devious ways.","Boomerang!"

"54",300733,304396,"Thank you, boys.Thank you.","Boomerang!"
"55",304470,307030,"More than any man I have ever known.","Boomerang!"
"56",307106,311702,"He gave his life completely to the serviceand to the welfare of others.","Boomerang!"
"57",311778,314713,"He was simple and unassuming...","Boomerang!"
"58",314781,317909,"yet we who knew himfelt he wore the mantle of greatness.","Boomerang!"

"62",331998,334796,"for unfortunately,there are too few like him.","Boomerang!"
"63",334867,337631,"The old minister spentmost ofhis life here...","Boomerang!"
"64",337704,339729,"quietly building uphis parish...","Boomerang!"
"65",339806,342240,"sharing the simple lifeofhis neighborhood...","Boomerang!"
"66",342308,344435,"and, somehow,imbuing his parishioners...","Boomerang!"
"67",344510,348571,"with some ofhis ownkindliness and humanity.","Boomerang!"
"68",348648,351412,"Maybe he was luckierthan most pastors...","Boomerang!"
"69",351484,354647,"for late in life a reform governmenttook over the city...","Boomerang!"
"70",354721,359624,"ousting the machine politiciansand bringing fresh impetus to city planning.","Boomerang!"
"71",359692,364220,"To such projects as parks,playgrounds and recreational centers...","Boomerang!"
"72",364297,368165,"the old man gladly contributedhis own wisdom and experience...","Boomerang!"
"73",368234,371226,"and the dignity and weightofhis church.","Boomerang!"
"74",371304,373568,"Mr. Harris has kindlypointed out this section.","Boomerang!"
"75",373639,375630,"I merely mentionedits accessibility...","Boomerang!"
"76",375708,378836,"and the fact that the bankmay be able to arrange for its purchase.","Boomerang!"
"77",378911,381937,"- Father Lambert?- Looks like an excellent site.","Boomerang!"
"78",382014,386348,"- I find bankers always seemto know these things.","Boomerang!"
"79",386419,390753,"Of course, Mrs. Harvey,as chairman, will have the final say.","Boomerang!"
"80",390823,394281,"I think it's just fine.It's wonderful.","Boomerang!"
"81",394360,397261," But his everyday workwas with the people ofhis parish...","Boomerang!"
"82",397330,400788,"and especially with thosewho sought his advice and counsel.","Boomerang!"
"83",400867,404496,"Since he was a man of God,his labors sometimes led him...","Boomerang!"
"84",404570,408131,"into the strange and secret placesof men's souls.","Boomerang!"
"85",408207,411699,"He was just and forgiving,but he was also a man...","Boomerang!"
"86",411778,414770,"and a stern and uncompromisingjudge of character.","Boomerang!"
"87",414847,416906,"Stop that.","Boomerang!"
"88",419419,422547,"Even if I had wantedto forgive you, l� I couldn't.","Boomerang!"
"89",422622,425386,"It's out of my hands.","Boomerang!"
"90",425458,427619,"- Jim, you're a sick man.- But, Father, l�","Boomerang!"

"94",436202,438693,"It's not people, son.It's you.","Boomerang!"
"95",438771,441171,"I've told you that before.","Boomerang!"
"96",441240,444676,"This time, fortunately,no great harm has been done.","Boomerang!"
"97",444744,447008,"But the next time�","Boomerang!"
"98",447079,449172,"No, I can't let yougo any longer.","Boomerang!"
"99",449248,451375,"It's got to be a sanitarium.","Boomerang!"
"100",452785,456016,"Have you spokento your mother about this?","Boomerang!"
"101",456088,458079,"You wouldn't tell her.","Boomerang!"
"102",458157,460250,"- I haven't spoken to anyone.- What about Father Gardiner?","Boomerang!"
"103",460326,463227,"Oh, Jim, you're startingall over again.","Boomerang!"
"104",463296,466857,"This is just between the two of us.","Boomerang!"
"105",466933,470096,"I prefer that youmake up your own mind, son...","Boomerang!"
"106",470169,474538,"but if you can't,I won't wait long.","Boomerang!"
"107",474607,477599,"For your own sake,I can't wait long.","Boomerang!"

"281",1164262,1167231,"- Isn't that right, Mac?- You didn't expect them
just to pull out, did you?","Boomerang!"

"297",1204969,1208097,"- We don't even know who the murderer is.- We've got to do something.","Boomerang!"
"298",1208172,1210504,"Look, we've gota good police force.","Boomerang!"

"300",1214145,1218138,"- That's what I say.- I don't know if you've given
this any consideration...","Boomerang!"
"301",1218216,1220241,"but the electiondepends on this case.","Boomerang!"
"302",1220318,1223651,"Well, Mac, we promised thema decent government.","Boomerang!"
"303",1223721,1225484,"- If we can't give it to them�- It's a matter of principle.","Boomerang!"
"304",1225556,1227786,"- It's a matter of the police chasing their tails.- I resent that!","Boomerang!"
"305",1227858,1230452,"I don't care whether you do or not.As for this prattle about backing up our boys�","Boomerang!"
"306",1230528,1232689,"You're making a lot of fussfor a commissioner of public works.","Boomerang!"
"307",1232763,1234788,"- I don't think you ought to say that.- Stop it!","Boomerang!"
"308",1234865,1238028,"You sound likea bunch of schoolgiris.","Boomerang!"
"309",1238102,1240127,"And what's your idea,Henry?","Boomerang!"
"310",1240204,1244868,"Suppose our boys can't crack it?Then what do we do?","Boomerang!"
"311",1244942,1247206,"Mac, if they don't,I don't see how anyone else can.","Boomerang!"
"312",1247278,1251044,"It's that kind of a case. So why don't wegive them a fighting chance and back 'em up?","Boomerang!"
"313",1251115,1253140,"- I think he's right.- I don't.","Boomerang!"
"314",1253217,1255617,"Henry is closer to this casethan any of us.","Boomerang!"
"315",1255686,1257677,"Mac, you told menot over an hour ago�","Boomerang!"
"316",1257755,1261521,"I've changed my mind.I respect Henry's judgment.","Boomerang!"
"317",1261592,1264891,"What about two weeks, Henry?Do you think that's fair?","Boomerang!"
"318",1264962,1267556,"- And then what?- Then we'll call in somebody else.","Boomerang!"
"319",1267632,1272365,"I don't know who,but somebody. Right?","Boomerang!"
"320",1272436,1274734,"A beer, gentlemen?","Boomerang!"
"321",1275873,1278706,"That's very nice.","Boomerang!"
"322",1278776,1283804,"If this thing falls through,I'm holding you personally responsible, Henry.","Boomerang!"
"323",1283881,1286315,"You're holding me?","Boomerang!"
"324",1289220,1291279,"Beer, gentlemen.","Boomerang!"
"325",1305002,1308335,"I don't care how you do it,but you've got to get more action.","Boomerang!"
"326",1308406,1311034,"Put more men on,get the state police, get anybody...","Boomerang!"
"327",1311108,1313269,"but we've got to get tothe bottom of this thing fast.","Boomerang!"
"328",1313344,1316404,"Is that clear?","Boomerang!"
"329",1316480,1319608,"Yeah, that's clear.","Boomerang!"
"330",1330161,1332186,"I was hoping I'd catch you.I want to talk to you.","Boomerang!"
"331",1332263,1334254,"- I saw the mayor�- You don't want to talk to me.","Boomerang!"
"332",1334332,1337199,"- The Lambert case, talk to White.- Why should I talk to White?","Boomerang!"
"333",1337268,1340396,"He's taking over.I quit.","Boomerang!"
"334",1340471,1343406,"- What's the matter?- I used to be able to work one of these things.","Boomerang!"
"335",1343474,1347205,"- Come on, Robbie. What's the matter?- Matter? Nothing.","Boomerang!"
"336",1347278,1349269,"Except it's turning intoa political three-ring circus.","Boomerang!"
"337",1349347,1351440,"And I'm no politician.I'm a cop�","Boomerang!"
"338",1351515,1353915,"a cop with a casethat has no leads, no angles.","Boomerang!"
"339",1353984,1356043,"Newspapers want action,okay, let them get another boy.","Boomerang!"
"340",1356120,1360420,"- Me, I'm through.- The newspapers are chasing us all.","Boomerang!"
"341",1360491,1362721,"I told you that two weeks ago.","Boomerang!"
"342",1362793,1364886,"But they've been takingpotshots at you for 20 years.","Boomerang!"
"343",1364962,1369456,"Not with country club presidentschewing me out every 20 minutes, they haven't.","Boomerang!"
"344",1369533,1372161,"Thomas Benson James.","Boomerang!"
"345",1372236,1375330,"- You're not quitting, Robbie.- I'm not?","Boomerang!"
"346",1375406,1377931,"- Who's gonna stop me?- You are.","Boomerang!"
"347",1378008,1380909,"- You're out of your head.- No, I'm not.","Boomerang!"
"348",1380978,1384778,"You said it yourself.You're a cop, and an honest one.","Boomerang!"
"349",1384849,1386840,"And you're walking outon honest men.","Boomerang!"
"350",1386917,1389283,"If you're talkingabout Thomas Benson James�","Boomerang!"
"351",1389353,1393153,"Yes, him too. They don't knowanything about politics much.","Boomerang!"
"352",1393224,1397024,"They're worried and excited,but they are trying to help the city.","Boomerang!"
"353",1397094,1399688,"- They can do it without me.- I don't think they can.","Boomerang!"
"354",1399764,1402289,"I was talking to them last night,and I told them...","Boomerang!"
"355",1402366,1405335,"that if anybody could lick this case,it would be you.","Boomerang!"
"356",1405403,1407701,"I even got them to promisethat they'd back you up...","Boomerang!"
"357",1407772,1410263,"without interferencefor two more weeks.","Boomerang!"
"358",1410341,1413037,"- Two more weeks. Then what?Call in Nick Carter?
- Chief�","Boomerang!"
"359",1413110,1415374,"- I'm busy.- I'm sorry, but what about these?","Boomerang!"
"360",1415446,1417471,"- I'm busy.- What are they?","Boomerang!"
"361",1417548,1420483,"Newspaper cartoonist. The witnessesall described the guy they saw to him.","Boomerang!"
"362",1420551,1423645,"- What are you gonna do with them?- Circulate them, I guess.","Boomerang!"
"363",1423721,1426053,"""Circulate them, I guess""?You've been on the force for 10 years...","Boomerang!"
"364",1426123,1429388,"a detective for three,you still don't know what to do?","Boomerang!"
"365",1429460,1432623,"Get a composite photo of theseand send them to every editor in the East.","Boomerang!"
"366",1432696,1434687,"Excuse me.And get moving.","Boomerang!"
"367",1434765,1438462,"- Yes, sir.- We'll get 4,000 suspects.","Boomerang!"
"368",1438536,1442302,"Maybe. One of themcould be the right one.","Boomerang!"
"369",1442373,1445069,"Well, keep punching, Robbie.","Boomerang!"
"370",1445142,1449670,"- Hey, I wanna talk to you.- I thought you'd see it my way, Robbie.","Boomerang!"
"371",1461258,1463385," The chief of policecame close to the truth...","Boomerang!"
"372",1463461,1466760,"when he talked of the number of suspectsthat would be picked up.","Boomerang!"
"373",1466831,1469231,"There weren't thousands, of course,but a trickle started...","Boomerang!"
"374",1469300,1472326,"which swelled to a steady streamas the manhunt fanned out...","Boomerang!"
"375",1472403,1478000,"to include neighboring cities,the state and, finally, all of New England.","Boomerang!"
"376",1478075,1481340,"Okay, okay, I'll send a car.","Boomerang!"
"377",1481412,1483744," The newspapers,especially those like the Record...","Boomerang!"
"378",1483814,1486749,"which were trying to holdthe Reform Administration up to ridicule...","Boomerang!"
"379",1486817,1489251,"kept public interestat a fever pitch...","Boomerang!"
"380",1489320,1494223,"until every man who wore a dark coator a light hat automatically became a suspect.","Boomerang!"
"381",1494291,1498387,"Mounting rewards by angry civic groupsadded to the incentive...","Boomerang!"
"382",1498462,1501454,"until men were being turned upfrom every walk oflife...","Boomerang!"
"383",1501532,1505298,"who bore even the faintest resemblanceto the supposed murderer.","Boomerang!"
"384",1505369,1508805,"Okay. Yeah.","Boomerang!"
"385",1508873,1511706,"All right.","Boomerang!"
"386",1511775,1514938," And actually,there was very little for anyone to go on.","Boomerang!"
"387",1515012,1518106,"The clue of the dark coatand light hat was slim enough...","Boomerang!"
"388",1518182,1521447,"and the nebulous figure conceivedin the minds of the seven witnesses...","Boomerang!"
"389",1521519,1525956,"and brought to life by an artist's penwas hardly much more.","Boomerang!"
"390",1526023,1528821,"And it became increasingly apparentthat almost as great a problem...","Boomerang!"
"391",1528893,1531589,"for the police asthe capture of the murderer...","Boomerang!"
"392",1531662,1535063,"was to be the overzealousnessof the public.","Boomerang!"
"393",1539336,1542828,"All right. So he came outof a poolroom. Who doesn't?","Boomerang!"
"394",1542907,1545467," And still the phone rangwith ever-increasing frequency...","Boomerang!"
"395",1545543,1548239,"at police headquarters,and still the prowl cars...","Boomerang!"
"396",1548312,1551770,"doggedly ran down every lead,streaking across the city...","Boomerang!"
"397",1551849,1555649,"in search of a furtive figureseen here, another seen there.","Boomerang!"
"398",1555719,1559587,"Something suspiciousabout their actions, something said...","Boomerang!"
"399",1559657,1563388,"or the mere fact of wearing a dark coatand a light hat.","Boomerang!"
"400",1570935,1573836,"And still men pouredinto police headquarters.","Boomerang!"
"401",1573904,1579365,"Angry men, indignant men,beaten men and dazed men.","Boomerang!"
"402",1579443,1581536,"Men with longcriminal records...","Boomerang!"
"403",1581612,1584843,"and simple men snatchedfrom peaceful pursuits...","Boomerang!"
"404",1584915,1588282,"all to be shoved into the glareof the lineup platform...","Boomerang!"
"405",1588352,1592789,"scrutinized,questioned and released...","Boomerang!"
"406",1592856,1595222,"in the forlorn hopethat one...","Boomerang!"
"407",1595292,1597817,"just oneof all these hundreds...","Boomerang!"
"408",1597895,1600921,"might be the man they sought.","Boomerang!"
"409",1610741,1612732,"Lady, sure,don't give it a thought.","Boomerang!"
"410",1612810,1614835,"We'll have a prowl carthere right away.","Boomerang!"
"411",1614912,1617745,"- Don't say I never did nothing for you.- What, no pie?","Boomerang!"
"412",1617815,1621649,"- Pie? What's the score, Dugan?- Score? Eight-to-five against me.","Boomerang!"
"413",1621719,1624187,"These phones keep ringinglike a three-alarm fire.","Boomerang!"
"414",1624254,1627087,"They're shaking suspectsout of their sleeves.","Boomerang!"
"415",1627157,1631992,"More. They even picked up my UncleJerrythe other night, 64 years old.","Boomerang!"
"416",1632062,1634257,"Did he do it?","Boomerang!"
"417",1634331,1637994,"Police department. Sergeant Dugan.Go ahead, Long Distance.","Boomerang!"
"418",1638068,1641196,"I bet the guy who done itis still walking around very happy.","Boomerang!"
"419",1641271,1643364,"Now you're a detective.","Boomerang!"
"420",1643440,1645908,"Hello? Who? Oh, yeah.","Boomerang!"
"421",1645976,1650913,"Go ahead, Ohio.Yeah. Yeah.","Boomerang!"
"422",1650981,1653711,"From here? Yeah!","Boomerang!"
"423",1653784,1655877,"Yeah! Wow!","Boomerang!"
"424",1655953,1659514,"Listen, Sarge, hang on.Yeah, any charge.","Boomerang!"
"425",1659590,1661717,"And don't say anything to him.Right.","Boomerang!"
"426",1661792,1663783,"- I'll call you back in 10 minutes.- What's up?","Boomerang!"

"550",2090120,2092486,"The difficulty of readjustmentor possibly�","Boomerang!"
"551",2092556,2094717,"Or possibly,it's something else.","Boomerang!"

"753",2814808,2817538,"And besides that, there's a small matterof Waldron being guilty.","Boomerang!"
"754",2817611,2819909,"You don't thinkany jury in the worid...","Boomerang!"
"755",2819980,2823882,"would convict a boy that gave the best yearsof his life to serving his country, do you?","Boomerang!"

"838",3089516,3092974,"as the man they had seen fleeingfrom the scene of the shooting.","Boomerang!"
"839",3094454,3098220,"Fifth, Waldron madea statement in writing...","Boomerang!"
"840",3098291,3100486,"admitting the crime.","Boomerang!"
"841",3100560,3104724,"Sixth, a revolverfound on Waldron...","Boomerang!"
"842",3104798,3107460,"was a.32-caliber weapon...","Boomerang!"
"843",3107534,3109627,"and was the gunfrom which a bullet...","Boomerang!"
"844",3109703,3112729,"found in the headof the deceased was discharged.","Boomerang!"
"845",3112806,3115240,"The functionof the city court...","Boomerang!"
"846",3115308,3117242,"and the coroner having beendischarged in due course...","Boomerang!"
"847",3117310,3121246,"it naturally fellunder my jurisdiction for action.","Boomerang!"
"848",3121314,3124477,"The evidence against the accusedseemed overwhelming.","Boomerang!"
"849",3124551,3127418,"Upon its face, at least,it seemed like a well-nigh perfect case...","Boomerang!"
"850",3127487,3130979,"affording little difficulty in the matterof successful prosecution.","Boomerang!"
"851",3131057,3134356,"My own view, necessarily,was that if the facts above stated...","Boomerang!"
"852",3134427,3137260,"were subject to verification...","Boomerang!"
"853",3137330,3141164,"the accusedwas undoubtedly guilty.","Boomerang!"

"855",3143904,3146839,"of an unusual characterinvolved...","Boomerang!"
"856",3146907,3149102,"making it highly important...","Boomerang!"

"858",3152512,3155242,"and in a mostimpartial manner.","Boomerang!"
"859",3156850,3159341,"It goes without saying...","Boomerang!"
"860",3159419,3161580,"that it is just as importantfor the state's attorney...","Boomerang!"
"861",3161655,3164920,"to use the great powersof his office...","Boomerang!"
"862",3164991,3168654,"to protect the innocentas it is to convict the guilty.","Boomerang!"
"863",3172265,3175564,"Your Honor, I have endeavoredto approach this case...","Boomerang!"

"895",3300627,3304393,"But if they're political, I'll not onlytake steps to have you disbarred...","Boomerang!"

"897",3313073,3316736,"It's quite possible thatmy motives are political.","Boomerang!"
"898",3316810,3319210,"It's also possible thatI think the man's innocent.","Boomerang!"
"899",3319279,3322578,"Mr. Harvey, you'd better doa great deal more than think.","Boomerang!"
"900",3352779,3355247,"Why don't youturn him loose, Whitey?","Boomerang!"

"931",3465258,3468694,"- Don't start anything, Mac.I don't wanna discuss it.
- Wade's talked with you. Maybe�","Boomerang!"

"1046",3936162,3939825,"No, I didn't give it to him. He told methey needed extra cash to buy the land...","Boomerang!"
"1047",3939899,3945235,"so I loaned that $2,500that Father left�","Boomerang!"
"1048",3945304,3949434,"- Was that wrong, Henry?- No, it doesn't make any difference.","Boomerang!"

"1080",4139965,4143298,"I announced that I was going to entera plea of nolle prosequi...","Boomerang!"
"1081",4143369,4146031,"in the case ofthe State versus John Waldron.","Boomerang!"
"1082",4146105,4150804,"You wish to amend that statement,Mr. State's Attorney?","Boomerang!"
"1083",4150876,4153242,"I do, Your Honor.","Boomerang!"
"1084",4153312,4156804,"There are so many bafflingaspects to this case that...","Boomerang!"
"1085",4156882,4161615,"I wish to reserve a plea until I've laidsome of this evidence before the court.","Boomerang!"
"1086",4161687,4163712,"Very well.","Boomerang!"
"1087",4163789,4165814,"Your Honor,such was the strange nature of this case...","Boomerang!"
"1088",4165891,4170419,"that I and the gentlemen of my officemade a detailed investigation into it.","Boomerang!"
"1089",4170496,4175160,"We felt that that would be necessaryfor any successful prosecution of the case.","Boomerang!"
"1090",4177036,4180472,"I realize that it's not in orderto call witnesses at this time...","Boomerang!"
"1091",4180539,4183599,"but with the court's permission,I would like to interrogate...","Boomerang!"
"1092",4183676,4186236,"certain persons who were presentat the coroner's inquest.","Boomerang!"
"1093",4186312,4190180,"- Sounds reasonable.- Thank you.","Boomerang!"
"1094",4190249,4193343,"I would like Mr. Graham Rogersto take the stand, please.","Boomerang!"

"1096",4197490,4199424,"Your Honor, the accusedis adequately represented...","Boomerang!"
"1097",4199492,4202484,"and I submit that the presentationof this evidence is highly improper.","Boomerang!"
"1098",4202561,4204825,"I regret to informdefense counsel...","Boomerang!"
"1099",4204897,4207024,"that since this isa preliminary proceeding...","Boomerang!"
"1100",4207099,4211160,"the state's attorneyis perfectly within his rights.","Boomerang!"
"1101",4211237,4213831,"You may proceed,Mr. State's Attorney.","Boomerang!"
"1102",4213906,4216875,"Stand up.Raise your right hand.","Boomerang!"

"1104",4219044,4221035,"the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,so help you God?","Boomerang!"
"1105",4221113,4222512,"- I do.- Your name?","Boomerang!"
"1106",4222581,4223980,"- Graham Rogers.- Sit down.","Boomerang!"
"1107",4224049,4226381,"Mr. Rogers,you were looking...","Boomerang!"
"1108",4226452,4229979,"directly across the street at the murdererat the time the shot was fired?","Boomerang!"
"1109",4230055,4232285,"Yes, sir.I was just closing up my shop.","Boomerang!"
"1110",4232358,4236886,"Your testimony says thatyou saw the murderer raise his arm...","Boomerang!"
"1111",4236962,4238987,"something glitteredin his hand...","Boomerang!"
"1112",4239064,4241532,"- and it was then that the shot was fired.- Yes, sir.","Boomerang!"
"1113",4241600,4244660,"Are you certainthat's what you saw?","Boomerang!"
"1114",4244737,4246796,"Yes, sir, absolutely.","Boomerang!"
"1115",4246872,4249340,"I don't mean to questionyour integrity, sir...","Boomerang!"
"1116",4249408,4252969,"but I must ask you again,are you certain that it glittered?","Boomerang!"
"1117",4253045,4255172,"Yes, sir, I'm certain.","Boomerang!"
"1118",4255247,4259343,"It was shadowy, but it was light enoughfrom the streetlight so I could see it.","Boomerang!"
"1119",4259418,4264981,"That's all, thank you.Your Honor, I'd like to show you this gun.","Boomerang!"
"1120",4265057,4267423,"Your Honor will observethat it is of a very dull finish...","Boomerang!"
"1121",4267493,4270553,"a finish similar to thatused by the army...","Boomerang!"
"1122",4270629,4275566,"the purpose of that being that no reflectionon the barrel will reveal the user's position.","Boomerang!"
"1123",4275634,4281368,"Your Honor, I submit that a gunspecifically designed not to reflect sunlight...","Boomerang!"
"1124",4281440,4283499,"could hardly glitter at night.","Boomerang!"
"1125",4286078,4288569,"It was this inconsistencyof testimony, Your Honor...","Boomerang!"
"1126",4288647,4290842,"which first struck me.","Boomerang!"
"1127",4290916,4293350,"I believe there are others.","Boomerang!"
"1128",4293419,4296855,"With the court's permission, I'll just questionthe next few witnesses in their seats.","Boomerang!"
"1129",4296989,4298786,"Proceed.","Boomerang!"
"1130",4298858,4301952,"Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen...","Boomerang!"
"1131",4302027,4305622,"the murder which you witnessedtook place on a particularly dark night...","Boomerang!"
"1132",4305698,4308929,"and the events which followedwere both unexpected and swift.","Boomerang!"
"1133",4309001,4313597,"Yet, you all unhesitatinglyidentified this man who now faces you.","Boomerang!"
"1134",4313672,4319304,"I must ask you again,is this the man? Mr. Rogers?","Boomerang!"
"1135",4319378,4321403,"- Yes, sir, I'm sure.- Mrs. Lukash?","Boomerang!"
"1136",4321480,4324278,"Yes, sir.","Boomerang!"
"1137",4324350,4328548,"Your Honor, I don't want to implythat this identification is not in good faith...","Boomerang!"
"1138",4328621,4330612,"but it wasa particularly dark night...","Boomerang!"
"1139",4330689,4333317,"and the basisfor the identification seems to be...","Boomerang!"
"1140",4333392,4338125,"that the murderer wore a dark coatand a light hat, a fairly common combination.","Boomerang!"
"1141",4339865,4342459,"Oh, there's one there.","Boomerang!"
"1142",4342534,4348473,"There's another.One of our distinguished witnesses has one.","Boomerang!"
"1143",4348540,4351338,"As a matter of fact,if I'm not mistaken...","Boomerang!"
"1144",4351410,4354311,"you wore such a combinationthis morning yourself, Your Honor.","Boomerang!"
"1145",4354380,4357781,"There could be no mistakein your identifications?","Boomerang!"
"1146",4360920,4365619,"The identification seems to be unanimousand conclusive, Your Honor.","Boomerang!"
"1147",4365691,4367750,"But on the nightof October 25...","Boomerang!"
"1148",4367826,4370158,"under approximatelythe same conditions...","Boomerang!"
"1149",4370229,4375360,"I and seven of my assistantsreran the crime.","Boomerang!"
"1150",4378337,4381033,"We reenacted it not once,but seven times...","Boomerang!"
"1151",4381106,4383267,"so that each of us couldsee it from a different point.","Boomerang!"
"1152",4383342,4385435,"- Herb? Phil?- No.","Boomerang!"
"1153",4385511,4386944,"- Dan?- Mm-mmm.","Boomerang!"
"1154",4387012,4390709,"- How about you, Smitty?- Everything all right, chief?","Boomerang!"
"1155",4390783,4393718,"- Anything wrong, chief?- Huh? No.","Boomerang!"
"1156",4393786,4396277,"Let's try it again, boys.Switch positions.","Boomerang!"
"1157",4396355,4398846,"Your Honor, I have herethe sworn statement...","Boomerang!"
"1158",4398924,4400949,"of each of my assistants...","Boomerang!"
"1159",4401026,4403221,"that not once duringall the reenactments...","Boomerang!"
"1160",4403295,4407891,"could any of them definitely statethat he recognized
the man portraying the murderer.","Boomerang!"
"1161",4407967,4409498,"Although, in each case,he knew him well.","Boomerang!"
"1162",4409533,4411030,"Although, in each case,he knew him well.","Boomerang!"
"1163",4411103,4413970,"Are you still certain of your identification,ladies and gentlemen?","Boomerang!"
"1164",4414039,4417031,"- You, Mrs. Lukash.- Well, I, uh�","Boomerang!"
"1165",4417109,4419703,"- Thank you very much.- Well, I'm certain.","Boomerang!"
"1166",4423582,4426176,"Would you take the stand,please, Miss Nelson?","Boomerang!"
"1167",4434960,4438157,"- What's he putting her up there for?- Quiet!","Boomerang!"
"1168",4438230,4440221,"- If he lets that dame�- Shh!","Boomerang!"
"1169",4440299,4442324,"- Well, she's nothing but a�- All you're going to do is hurt yourself!","Boomerang!"
"1170",4442401,4444926,"Miss Nelson,your testimony states...","Boomerang!"
"1171",4445004,4447029,"that on the eveningof the murder...","Boomerang!"
"1172",4447106,4450007,"- you stood in the windowof the Coney Island Caf�.
- Yeah.","Boomerang!"
"1173",4450075,4452066,"And that you coulddefinitely state that...","Boomerang!"
"1174",4452144,4454169,"the man you sawthrough the window...","Boomerang!"
"1175",4454246,4456237,"at 7:20 on the eveningof September 29...","Boomerang!"
"1176",4456315,4458340,"was the accused, John Waldron?","Boomerang!"
"1177",4458417,4460612,"- That's what I said.- I may be assuming...","Boomerang!"
"1178",4460686,4463746,"but isn't it possible that such an attractiveyoung lady as yourself.'...","Boomerang!"
"1179",4463822,4467019,"- might have several gentleman friends?- Mm-hmm.","Boomerang!"
"1180",4467092,4469185,"Mm-hmm.And isn't it possible...","Boomerang!"
"1181",4469261,4472128,"that these friends in passingthe restaurant might wave to you...","Boomerang!"
"1182",4472197,4474131,"- through the window?- Mm-hmm.","Boomerang!"
"1183",4474199,4476895,"And isn't it also possible,Miss Nelson...","Boomerang!"
"1184",4476969,4481099,"that it was notJohn Waldron,but another of your friends...","Boomerang!"
"1185",4481173,4484074,"- who waved to you throughthe window that night?
- No.","Boomerang!"
"1186",4486045,4488605,"Your Honor, in the courseof examining the evidence in this case...","Boomerang!"
"1187",4488680,4492081,"I also visitedthe Coney Island Caf�.","Boomerang!"
"1188",4492151,4495552,"And, upon her advice, I stood behindthe counter in the exact spot...","Boomerang!"
"1189",4495621,4501582,"where Miss Nelson states that she sawJohn Waldron on the evening of September 29.","Boomerang!"
"1190",4501660,4504720,"From this point, the window of the caf�is obscured to a point...","Boomerang!"
"1191",4504797,4508255,"of four and a halfto five feet by steam.","Boomerang!"
"1192",4508333,4513134,"It is possible, however,to see dimly through the window.","Boomerang!"
"1193",4513205,4516936,"But one of my men passed the windowwhile I watched...","Boomerang!"
"1194",4517009,4522072,"and although I know this man well,it was impossible for me to recognize him.","Boomerang!"
"1195",4522147,4524775,"Miss Nelson, did you knowthat rewards for information...","Boomerang!"
"1196",4524850,4528513,"leading to the arrest and convictionof the murderer total $8,000?","Boomerang!"
"1197",4528587,4531954,"- I did not.- Your application
for the reward is already on file.","Boomerang!"
"1198",4532024,4534559,"Miss Nelson,before you answer me...","Boomerang!"
"1199",4534692,4536592,"please remember that not onlyis the man's life in jeopardy...","Boomerang!"
"1200",4536661,4538652,"but that you mightbe sent to prison for perjury!","Boomerang!"
"1201",4538729,4541357,"Now, was it Waldronyou saw through that window?","Boomerang!"
"1202",4541432,4543366,"Was this the man?","Boomerang!"
"1203",4543434,4546926,"- Well, I'm not absolutely sure�- Thank you, Miss Nelson.","Boomerang!"
"1204",4547004,4549700,"That's all. I would like Miss Katherine Manionto come to the stand, please.","Boomerang!"
"1205",4561719,4564654,"What's Harvey trying to do?","Boomerang!"
"1206",4564722,4566952,"- What?- What's he doing?","Boomerang!"
"1207",4567024,4571484,"Giving O'Shea a lessonin trial procedure.","Boomerang!"
"1208",4573764,4578724,"- Miss Manion, you are anemployee of the Plaza Theater?
- Yes, sir.","Boomerang!"
"1209",4580071,4582369,"And in your capacityas cashier...","Boomerang!"
"1210",4582440,4585876,"you naturally pride yourselfon your memory for faces?","Boomerang!"
"1211",4585943,4589037,"Yes, sir, I-I do.","Boomerang!"
"1212",4589113,4593174,"And you can definitely statethat the accused, John Waldron...","Boomerang!"
"1213",4593250,4595878,"did not enter your theateron the night of September 29?","Boomerang!"
"1214",4595953,4598080,"Yes, sir.","Boomerang!"
"1215",4598155,4601921,"Thank you. Miss Manion,this is my assistant, Mr. Stone.","Boomerang!"
"1216",4601993,4604587,"How do you do?","Boomerang!"
"1217",4604662,4609565,"- Was he in your theateron Tuesday night of last week?
- Oh, no, sir.","Boomerang!"
"1218",4609634,4613764,"Your Honor,at 8:13 on Tuesday night of last week...","Boomerang!"
"1219",4613838,4616932,"observed by two reliablewitnesses and myself...","Boomerang!"
"1220",4617008,4621274,"Mr. Stone bought a ticketto the Plaza Theater from Miss Manion.","Boomerang!"
"1221",4621345,4623006,"- Well, l�- We're all human, Miss Manion.","Boomerang!"
"1222",4623080,4625446,"That's all. Thank you.Your Honor, I think...","Boomerang!"
"1223",4625516,4628747,"we can state at this point that the evidenceof the eyewitness is subject to question.","Boomerang!"
"1224",4628819,4632220,"Very interesting,but scarcely conclusive.","Boomerang!"
"1225",4632289,4635019,"Well, I agree with the court.","Boomerang!"
"1226",4635092,4638061,"If I've shown that the witnessesmight have been mistaken...","Boomerang!"
"1227",4638129,4640689,"they might as easilyhave been correct.","Boomerang!"
"1228",4640765,4644201,"But as I've stated, Your Honor,there are certain aspects of this case...","Boomerang!"
"1229",4644268,4646862,"which are confusing.","Boomerang!"
"1230",4646937,4648838,"- Do I have the court's permission to continue?- Proceed.","Boomerang!"
"1231",4648873,4650739,"- Do I have the court's permission to continue?- Proceed.","Boomerang!"
"1232",4650808,4656405,"Thank you. I would like Dr. William Rainsfordto take the stand, please.","Boomerang!"
"1233",4659884,4662478,"Stand up. Raise your right hand.","Boomerang!"
"1234",4662553,4664578,"Do you swear the evidenceyou are about to give to be the truth...","Boomerang!"
"1235",4664655,4666646,"the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,so help you God?","Boomerang!"
"1236",4666724,4669215,"- Name, please?- Dr. William Rainsford.","Boomerang!"
"1237",4669293,4673423,"- Where you been, Dave?- Overslept. What's the score?","Boomerang!"
"1238",4673497,4677831,"Dr. Rainsford, I realize that youwere retained by the police department...","Boomerang!"
"1239",4677902,4682339,"to examineJohn Waldron, and have thereforealready formed an opinion of him.","Boomerang!"
"1240",4682406,4685341,"But as a physicianand psychiatrist...","Boomerang!"
"1241",4685409,4689812,"you will admit that in a stateof exhaustion approaching hysteria...","Boomerang!"
"1242",4689880,4692678,"a man is highly susceptibleto suggestion.","Boomerang!"
"1243",4692750,4697983,"Certainly. Though, I have some doubtas to its application to the accused.","Boomerang!"
"1244",4698055,4702492,"I didn't ask you that, Doctor.I asked you for your professional opinion.","Boomerang!"
"1245",4702560,4705427,"In that event,I should have to answer yes.","Boomerang!"
"1246",4705496,4708329,"That's all, Doctor.Thank you.","Boomerang!"
"1247",4708399,4711266,"I would like Chief Robinsonto take the stand, please.","Boomerang!"
"1248",4716240,4718265,"Raise your right hand.","Boomerang!"
"1249",4718342,4720708,"Do you swear that the evidenceyou are about to give to be the truth...","Boomerang!"
"1250",4720778,4723212,"the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,so help you God?","Boomerang!"
"1251",4723280,4725680,"- Name, please?- Harold F. Robinson.","Boomerang!"
"1252",4725750,4727980,"Sit down.","Boomerang!"
"1253",4728052,4731544,"Chief Robinson, you were present duringthe entire questioning ofJohn Waldron...","Boomerang!"
"1254",4731622,4735820,"and you state that nothing was doneto force a confession from the accused.","Boomerang!"
"1255",4735893,4740227,"He confessed of his own free will.There was no physical violence.","Boomerang!"
"1256",4740297,4743289,"But you did implantthe idea in his mind?","Boomerang!"
"1257",4743367,4745835,"He confessed himself.","Boomerang!"
"1258",4747638,4751699,"Yet, at 11:55 a.m.,after hours of questioning...","Boomerang!"
"1259",4751776,4754472,"Dr. Rainsfordsaid to the accused...","Boomerang!"
"1260",4754545,4756536,"""You made himthe personification...","Boomerang!"
"1261",4756614,4761483,"of every handout, every word of advice,and in a rage you shot him.""","Boomerang!"
"1262",4761552,4763850,"- Is that correct?- Yes, but�","Boomerang!"
"1263",4763921,4766719,"- That's all, Chief.- That's not all!","Boomerang!"
"1264",4766791,4770090,"You're excused, sir.","Boomerang!"
"1265",4770161,4773324,"Thank you.","Boomerang!"
"1266",4775132,4777225,"Your Honor, while I feelthat the validity...","Boomerang!"
"1267",4777301,4779565,"of the defendant's confessionmay be challenged...","Boomerang!"
"1268",4779637,4783505,"I'm forced to admit that it too fallsin the category of the inconclusive.","Boomerang!"
"1269",4783574,4786600,"Both the testimonyof the eyewitnesses...","Boomerang!"
"1270",4786677,4791205,"and the confession itself would be subjectto long argument at a trial.","Boomerang!"
"1271",4791282,4795378,"And there are even more concretepieces of evidence in this case
that we have already examined.","Boomerang!"
"1272",4795452,4801288,"Your Honor, this is the bullettaken from the head of the deceased.","Boomerang!"
"1273",4801358,4804555,"The police ballistics experthas already stated...","Boomerang!"
"1274",4804628,4807927,"that it came from the gunfound on the person ofJohn Waldron.","Boomerang!"
"1275",4809600,4811864,"My office has been extremelyinterested in this bullet...","Boomerang!"
"1276",4811936,4815428,"and with the permissionof the police department...","Boomerang!"
"1277",4815506,4820466,"we have conducted experimentswith the bullet and with the accused's gun.","Boomerang!"
"1278",4820544,4825743,"Now, it's not my intentionto go into the technicalities ofballistics...","Boomerang!"
"1279",4825816,4828944,"or call in experts to testify.","Boomerang!"
"1280",4829019,4831385,"However, five independentballistics experts...","Boomerang!"
"1281",4831455,4835391,"have been retained by my officeto make tests in this case...","Boomerang!"
"1282",4835459,4838724,"and, uh,with the court's permission...","Boomerang!"
"1283",4838796,4841663,"- I would like to brieflysummarize their findings.
- Proceed.","Boomerang!"
"1284",4843167,4847331,"Your Honor,in photograph ""A""...","Boomerang!"
"1285",4847404,4850339,"is the bullet whichI hold in my hand.","Boomerang!"
"1286",4850407,4856573,"This picture, labeled ""B,""is that of a bullet fired
from the gun ofJohn Waldron.","Boomerang!"
"1287",4856647,4859309,"I won't pretend that I can discusslands and grooves...","Boomerang!"
"1288",4859383,4861578,"with the authorityof an expert...","Boomerang!"
"1289",4861652,4864314,"but to the untutored eye,even to the eye of an expert...","Boomerang!"
"1290",4864388,4868324,"these two bulletswould seem identical.","Boomerang!"
"1291",4868392,4871259,"There is oneminor difference, however.","Boomerang!"
"1292",4871328,4874786,"When this bullet was removedfrom the head of the deceased...","Boomerang!"
"1293",4874865,4878301,"a small particlewas left in the brain.","Boomerang!"
"1294",4878369,4880963,"Our police force didn't feelthat it was important...","Boomerang!"
"1295",4881038,4883598,"to remove that particlefor their ballistics test.","Boomerang!"
"1296",4883674,4886802,"But, Your Honor, that particlewas highly important...","Boomerang!"
"1297",4886877,4889175,"to the ballistics expertsretained by my office.","Boomerang!"
"1298",4889246,4894183,"They all agreed that the two bulletswere remarkably similar...","Boomerang!"
"1299",4894251,4897015,"but I have heretheir sworn statements...","Boomerang!"
"1300",4897087,4900545,"that the two bullets could not have beenfired from the same gun.","Boomerang!"
"1301",4907731,4909722,"Order!Order in the court!","Boomerang!"
"1302",4912036,4914027,"However, I'm forced to admitthat this too...","Boomerang!"
"1303",4914104,4917005,"falls in the categoryof the inconclusive.","Boomerang!"
"1304",4917074,4919133,"If Mr. Johnston,the police expert...","Boomerang!"
"1305",4919209,4924340,"still insists that these two bulletswere fired from the same gun...","Boomerang!"
"1306",4924415,4928146,"the odds are five-to-oneagainst him that they were not.","Boomerang!"
"1307",4928218,4932518,"However,the odds are still present.","Boomerang!"
"1308",4932589,4937925,"Your Honor, this is the gun that was takenfrom the person ofJohn Waldron...","Boomerang!"
"1309",4937995,4940259,"on the night of his capture.","Boomerang!"
"1310",4940331,4942390,"Would Your Honorkindly examine it, please?","Boomerang!"
"1311",4942466,4945765,"The gun isa.32-caliber weapon...","Boomerang!"
"1312",4945836,4948066,"and these are the bulletsthat go with it.","Boomerang!"
"1313",4948138,4952666,"There are six bullets.Would Your Honor kindly examine them also?","Boomerang!"
"1314",4959917,4962579,"And now,insert them in the gun.","Boomerang!"
"1315",4974331,4976697,"And now,may I have it, please?","Boomerang!"
"1316",4988112,4990103,"Mr. Harvey,that's a loaded gun!","Boomerang!"
"1317",4990180,4994310,"I'll be extremely careful, Your Honor.Mr. Whitney, please.","Boomerang!"
"1318",4994385,4996410,"In the reenactmentof the murder...","Boomerang!"
"1319",4996487,5000719,"we found, through the examinationof the trajectory of the bullet...","Boomerang!"
"1320",5000791,5005251,"that the murdererhad to hold the gun...","Boomerang!"
"1321",5005329,5008457,"in exactly this positionwhen the shot was fired.","Boomerang!"
"1322",5008532,5010557,"Through examinationof the powder burns...","Boomerang!"
"1323",5010634,5012932,"we found that Father Lambertmust have been within six inches of the gun...","Boomerang!"
"1324",5013003,5015198,"or about here.","Boomerang!"
"1325",5020677,5023407,"Henry!","Boomerang!"
"1326",5023480,5029146,"Mr. Whitney,will you fire the gun?","Boomerang!"
"1327",5032423,5036826,"I must apologize, Your Honor,for the use of theatrics in this presentation...","Boomerang!"
"1328",5036894,5038987,"but there's a defectin the firing pin of this gun.","Boomerang!"
"1329",5039063,5041588,"It's loose and faulty,making it impossible...","Boomerang!"
"1330",5041665,5045533,"for the gun to be firedin this position.","Boomerang!"
"1331",5045602,5049595,"We tried it 16 times.","Boomerang!"
"1332",5049673,5052642,"That was the 17 th.","Boomerang!"
"1333",5069760,5072661,"He shot himself!","Boomerang!"
"1334",5072729,5076290," Let him alone.Stand up there. Get back there, please.","Boomerang!"
"1335",5076366,5079494,"It's always the same.You look around long enough...","Boomerang!"
"1336",5079570,5082903,"you'll find some guywith his fingers in the till.","Boomerang!"
"1337",5082973,5085533,"- I went to Hartford last night.- Why?","Boomerang!"
"1338",5085609,5089067,"I met Harris after he left your house.He said you were switching.","Boomerang!"
"1339",5089146,5092138,"I didn't think you werethat kind of a guy.","Boomerang!"
"1340",5103494,5106224,"MacDonald, I just made one mistake.","Boomerang!"
"1341",5106296,5109754,"I should've known by now that there'sone thing you can't beat in politics...","Boomerang!"
"1342",5109833,5112028,"and that's a completely honest man.","Boomerang!"
"1343",5112102,5115003,"Well, I wonder how Floridawill be for the winter?","Boomerang!"
"1344",5115072,5118838,"I'm afraid people get just as tiredof reform as they do of anything else.","Boomerang!"
"1345",5118909,5120900,"- You'll be back.- I know.","Boomerang!"
"1346",5120978,5123071,"You'll be back.","Boomerang!"
"1347",5124915,5128112,"You don't lookvery happy, Henry.","Boomerang!"
"1348",5128185,5130881,"I- I was just thinkingof Paul.","Boomerang!"
"1349",5130954,5137120,"Yes� Paul. Well, Paul more or lesspassed judgment on himself.","Boomerang!"
"1350",5137194,5139287,"I suppose so.","Boomerang!"
"1351",5141198,5143962,"Mr. Harvey, that wasa good presentation.","Boomerang!"
"1352",5144034,5146298,"Very good.","Boomerang!"
"1353",5146370,5151774,"I called you a politician yesterday,and... I was wrong.","Boomerang!"
"1354",5151842,5156211,"Forget it, Robbie.I know how you felt.","Boomerang!"
"1355",5156280,5158339,"Um�","Boomerang!"
"1356",5163120,5166988,"I'll bet that stubborn, old goatstill doesn't believe he's innocent.","Boomerang!"
"1357",5167057,5169753,"It may take him a little time.After all, it took him a long time...","Boomerang!"
"1358",5169826,5172090,"to decide he was guilty.","Boomerang!"
"1359",5172162,5176758,"- That's why I like him.- Oh, I like him too, but
he's still a stubborn, old goat.","Boomerang!"
"1360",5176833,5178892,"Oh, Waldron?","Boomerang!"
"1361",5183240,5185435,"Well, uh,what are you gonna do now?","Boomerang!"
"1362",5185509,5187807,"I don't know.I'll get something goin'.","Boomerang!"
"1363",5187878,5191109,"It's about time,don't you think?","Boomerang!"
"1364",5191181,5195140,"Mr. Harvey,I don't know how to thank you.","Boomerang!"
"1365",5195219,5197847,"Don't try.","Boomerang!"
"1366",5197921,5200014,"Well�","Boomerang!"
"1367",5209266,5212667,"No kiddin', Dave,how did you peg that corporation?","Boomerang!"
"1368",5212736,5217105,"I never reveal my methods.What's that?","Boomerang!"
"1369",5217174,5220007,"Say, don't you ever readanything but your own stuff?","Boomerang!"
"1370",5220077,5222102,"The guy was killedin a crack up.","Boomerang!"
"1371",5222179,5224272,"Screwiest thing you ever saw.","Boomerang!"
"1372",5224348,5226441,"One of our boysgot on his tail for speedin'!","Boomerang!"
"1373",5226516,5229212,"Chased him for a mile or so,and, all of the sudden...","Boomerang!"
"1374",5229286,5232483,"the guy swerved,and that was that.","Boomerang!"
"1375",5233190,5235215,"This case was never solved.","Boomerang!"
"1376",5235292,5239388,"And within 24 hours,John Waldron was once again a free man.","Boomerang!"
"1377",5239463,5242899,"The case is still open on the police booksof a Connecticut city...","Boomerang!"
"1378",5242966,5245127,"and it may interest you to knowthat there are those...","Boomerang!"
"1379",5245202,5247796,"who still believethe accused man was guilty.","Boomerang!"
"1380",5247871,5251637,"It may interest you too to knowthat the man we have depicted for you...","Boomerang!"
"1381",5251708,5253539,"as State's Attorney Harvey...","Boomerang!"
"1382",5253610,5258240,"was actually a Connecticut lawyernamed Homer Cummings.","Boomerang!"
"1383",5258315,5260875,"He did not become governorof the state.","Boomerang!"

"823",3725072,3729384,"- You've been very careless, Mr. Wormold.- There was nothing in them that mattered.","Our Man in Havana"
"824",3729512,3730740,"So I believed.","Our Man in Havana"
"825",3731312,3734349,"I would not have agreedto cooperate with them otherwise.","Our Man in Havana"
"826",3734472,3737703,"- Who are they?- They do not introduce themselves.","Our Man in Havana"
"827",3739472,3743704,"The people who tore up my laboratoryand stole my papers.","Our Man in Havana"
"828",3744272,3748185,"Had they reported me to the police,they could have deported me.","Our Man in Havana"
"829",3748792,3753388,"How was I to knowthat what I decoded for them was true?","Our Man in Havana"
"830",3753512,3755582,"You advised me to invent and I invented.","Our Man in Havana"
"831",3755712,3758226,"So far as I'm concerned,Montez was an invention.","Our Man in Havana"
"832",3758352,3760263,"Then you invented him too well.","Our Man in Havana"
"833",3761952,3764705,"He was no more real to methan a character in a novel.","Our Man in Havana"
"834",3764832,3767346,"His name was real enough,and his profession.","Our Man in Havana"
"835",3768352,3770343,"He denied working for you.","Our Man in Havana"
"836",3770912,3774951,"They offered him a great deal of moneyif he would work for them instead.","Our Man in Havana"
"837",3775992,3779951,"They, too, wanted photographsof the constructions in the mountains.","Our Man in Havana"
"838",3780072,3783223,"- There are no constructions.- So I thought.","Our Man in Havana"
"839",3784432,3787902,"But the British Secret Servicewould not be so easily deceived.","Our Man in Havana"
"840",3788152,3790382,"Neither will other people here.","Our Man in Havana"
"841",3791872,3794102,"Why didn't you stick to invention?","Our Man in Havana"
"842",3794312,3795791,"I don't even know...","Our Man in Havana"
"843",3797232,3800304,"why I picked on the name of Montez.","Our Man in Havana"
"844",3800712,3803272,"I would have loaned you money.I offered to.","Our Man in Havana"
"845",3803392,3807431,"- I needed more than you could lend.- It needs no skill to kill a man.","Our Man in Havana"
"846",3807552,3810988,"But to save a man,that takes six years of training...","Our Man in Havana"
"847",3811152,3813302,"and then one cannot be sure.","Our Man in Havana"
"848",3813992,3818065,"There is not one patientthat I know for certain that I have saved.","Our Man in Havana"
"849",3818352,3821583,"But the man I killed, I know him.","Our Man in Havana"
"850",3822232,3823984,"Why dress up as a soldier?","Our Man in Havana"
"851",3825232,3828383,"I was not dressed this waywhen I killed a man.","Our Man in Havana"
"852",3829112,3832661,"I was dressed as a doctorand I was reading Charles Lamb.","Our Man in Havana"

"854",3840432,3841626,"Hello, Teresa.","Our Man in Havana"
"855",3844952,3848740,"That's him. I recognise him perfectly.A disgraceful scene.","Our Man in Havana"
"856",3848912,3851745,"There was no needfor you to send your men to fetch us.","Our Man in Havana"
"857",3851872,3854545,"Mr. Wormold,you're playing the wrong character.","Our Man in Havana"
"858",3854952,3857307,"It is I who am the injured party.","Our Man in Havana"
"859",3857712,3861671,"Yesterday you gave me your word of honourthat you did not know Capt. Montez.","Our Man in Havana"
"860",3861792,3864864,"I repeat it.I've never set eyes on him in my life.","Our Man in Havana"
"861",3864992,3869304,"It's a lie! He drank with Capt. Montez andmyself on the terrace of the country club.","Our Man in Havana"
"862",3869432,3871150,"He pressed his attentions on us.","Our Man in Havana"
"863",3871272,3874628,"He wanted to speak to me privatelyand he followed me to the washroom.","Our Man in Havana"
"864",3874752,3877141,"He left the pilot sitting at the tableon the terrace.","Our Man in Havana"
"865",3877272,3878261,"That will be all.","Our Man in Havana"
"866",3878392,3881384,"As long as you remain indoors,you'll be safe. Take her with you.","Our Man in Havana"
"867",3881512,3882865,"The country club?","Our Man in Havana"
"868",3884272,3885990,"There was a man in uniform.","Our Man in Havana"
"869",3887712,3890863,"How did you make the engineer talk?Thumbscrews?","Our Man in Havana"
"870",3891272,3894264,"The engineer does not belongto the torturable class.","Our Man in Havana"
"871",3894552,3896861,"Are there class distinctions in torture?","Our Man in Havana"
"872",3896992,3900746,"Some people expect to be tortured.Others are outraged by it.","Our Man in Havana"
"873",3901552,3904350,"One never torturesexcept by mutual agreement.","Our Man in Havana"
"874",3904672,3907140,"- Who agrees?- Usually the poor.","Our Man in Havana"
"875",3908392,3911907,"In your welfare stateyou have social security...","Our Man in Havana"
"876",3912432,3914150,"therefore you have no poor.","Our Man in Havana"
"877",3914272,3917264,"Consequently there you are untorturable.","Our Man in Havana"
"878",3917592,3921904,"- I may have said something to him.- What did you say, Mr. Wormold?","Our Man in Havana"
"879",3922872,3925306,"I said I might have spoken to him.","Our Man in Havana"
"880",3926432,3927785,"What does that prove?","Our Man in Havana"
"881",3927912,3930870,"I do not have to prove anything,Mr. Wormold.","Our Man in Havana"
"882",3931392,3934225,"It is my jobto know what goes on in Havana.","Our Man in Havana"
"883",3936592,3940983,"This is a deportation order, Mr. Wormold.The names are not filled in yet.","Our Man in Havana"
"884",3943032,3944670,"Because you have no evidence.","Our Man in Havana"
"885",3944792,3948102,"Because Havana would be poorerwithout your daughter.","Our Man in Havana"
"886",3948272,3952788,"But if I'm to do something to protect you,you must do something in return.","Our Man in Havana"
"887",3952992,3955142,"- What?- You must be my agent.","Our Man in Havana"
"888",3956712,3959829,"- But you're crazy!- I'm not interested in your employers.","Our Man in Havana"
"889",3959952,3963786,"But the information you supply to them,you will also supply to me.","Our Man in Havana"
"890",3963912,3965311,"But this is all rubbish.","Our Man in Havana"
"891",3965432,3969710,"There will, of course, be adequate fundsdeposited to your bank account.","Our Man in Havana"
"892",3972272,3973387,"What?","Our Man in Havana"

"894",3979032,3981944,"I don't want to leave Havana,Captain Segura.","Our Man in Havana"
"895",3982792,3985431,"Perhaps you can persuade Mr. Wormold.","Our Man in Havana"
"896",3992512,3995072,"One day I'll beat you at that damn game.","Our Man in Havana"
"897",3995192,3997069,"I doubt it, Mr. Wormold.","Our Man in Havana"

"905",4052232,4053347,"I was rather suspicious.","Our Man in Havana"
"906",4053472,4056464,"Frankly, they reminded meof parts of a vacuum cleaner.","Our Man in Havana"
"907",4058712,4060111,"That struck me, too.","Our Man in Havana"
"908",4060232,4062871,"Because, I rememberedall those thingummies in your shop.","Our Man in Havana"
"909",4062992,4066621,"Midget Make-easy, snap-action couplingand all that Atomic nonsense.","Our Man in Havana"
"910",4066752,4068390,"I knew it seems fantastic now.","Our Man in Havana"
"911",4068512,4072107,"You mean you thought that I had triedto pull the leg of the Secret Service?","Our Man in Havana"
"912",4072232,4073460,"That did occur to me...","Our Man in Havana"
"913",4073592,4076823,"until I found the othershad made up their minds to murder you.","Our Man in Havana"

"915",4079872,4081100,"Did you say murder me?","Our Man in Havana"

"920",4091032,4092988,"I think you'll like that.","Our Man in Havana"
"921",4093832,4097222,"Would you mind telling mewho is going to murder me and how?","Our Man in Havana"

"1221",5417872,5421626,"The way you watch the door,I thought perhaps you had friends.","Our Man in Havana"
"1222",5422712,5424191,"I have no friends.","Our Man in Havana"
"1223",5427152,5429791,"Go on, Carter, she wants to be undone.","Our Man in Havana"
"1224",5439912,5443427,"I'm sorry, I can't get it undone.","Our Man in Havana"
"1225",5450832,5453869,"I don't like horseplay.","Our Man in Havana"
"1226",5454032,5456990,"You can see this sort of show anywhere,just girls undressing.","Our Man in Havana"
"1227",5457112,5459467,"You're shy of women, aren't you, Carter?","Our Man in Havana"
"1228",5459792,5461748,"There are more important things.","Our Man in Havana"
"1229",5469872,5471669,"Rotten brandy this is.","Our Man in Havana"
"1230",5472232,5473950,"Let's move on, then.","Our Man in Havana"
"1231",5474312,5476906,"Haven't they got a decent drink here?","Our Man in Havana"
"1232",5478792,5482307,"- I thought you said this was the Ofelia?- I changed my mind.","Our Man in Havana"
"1233",5487112,5488227,"Why?","Our Man in Havana"
"1234",5488872,5491386,"It's nearer to where we have to end.","Our Man in Havana"
"1235",5496512,5497831,"Then let's go.","Our Man in Havana"
"1236",5530752,5532185,"There you are.","Our Man in Havana"
"1237",5540192,5541307,"A friend of yours?","Our Man in Havana"
"1238",5541432,5544185,"A friend of a friend, really. He's blind.","Our Man in Havana"
"1239",5544792,5547067,"- Blind?- Yes. It's a pity you didn't know that.","Our Man in Havana"
"1240",5547192,5550070,"I mean,you might have given him some money.","Our Man in Havana"
"1241",5554592,5556264,"This is the house.","Our Man in Havana"
"1242",5556952,5559341,"Perhaps it would be more sensiblesome other night.","Our Man in Havana"
"1243",5559472,5560951,"Ring the bell.","Our Man in Havana"
"1244",5562912,5564231,"But you're coming in?","Our Man in Havana"
"1245",5564352,5567310,"No, Carter, this is where you end up.","Our Man in Havana"
"1246",5568312,5569586,"Alone.","Our Man in Havana"
"1247",5573952,5575783,"You're making a mistake.","Our Man in Havana"
"1248",5577392,5579064,"I'm not important.","Our Man in Havana"
"1249",5581152,5584224,"I was under orders, like you.","Our Man in Havana"
"1250",5594832,5597141,"My pipe. You broke my pipe.","Our Man in Havana"
"1251",5597272,5598830,"Beginner's luck.","Our Man in Havana"
"1252",5600072,5601790,"I'm not even armed.","Our Man in Havana"
"1253",5604992,5608109,"Wormold, we're just private soldiers,you and I.","Our Man in Havana"
"1254",5608672,5610788,"They'll take care of you in there.","Our Man in Havana"
"1255",5669952,5671749,"It was a fair fight.","Our Man in Havana"
"1256",5676072,5678791,"For as much as the spirit of the departed...","Our Man in Havana"
"1257",5678912,5681028,"has entered into the life immortal...","Our Man in Havana"
"1258",5681152,5685270,"we therefore commit the bodyof this our brother, Carl Hasselbacher...","Our Man in Havana"
"1259",5685752,5689904,"Receive into thy merciful hands,O Lord, the soul of this, thy servant...","Our Man in Havana"

"1262",5694712,5698307,"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.","Our Man in Havana"
"1263",5699672,5700627,"Amen.","Our Man in Havana"
"1264",5715472,5717269,"There weren't many of us, were there?","Our Man in Havana"
"1265",5717392,5720270,"I wish Beatrice and Rudy could have stayed.","Our Man in Havana"
"1266",5733872,5736181,"Mr. Wormold, one moment, please.","Our Man in Havana"
"1267",5736432,5739583,"I have signed your deportation papersafter all.","Our Man in Havana"
"1268",5741032,5743944,"- For what reason?- You prefer to work alone.","Our Man in Havana"
"1269",5744352,5748789,"Unofficially speaking, I do not feelmyself safe with you around.","Our Man in Havana"
"1270",5749792,5752226,"I want you to leave immediately to London.","Our Man in Havana"
"1271",5753352,5755661,"- For London?- London.","Our Man in Havana"
"1272",5769992,5772062,"Will you come and see me in Switzerland?","Our Man in Havana"
"1273",5772192,5774786,"I shall make every effort, I promise.","Our Man in Havana"
"1274",5775072,5778462,"- May I go skiing to make up for Seraphina?- Of course.","Our Man in Havana"
"1275",5789712,5792385,"I have come to see the last of you,Mr. Wormold.","Our Man in Havana"
"1276",5793152,5795268,"Havana will miss you, Milly.","Our Man in Havana"
"1277",5795552,5797907,"Will you look after Seraphina carefully?","Our Man in Havana"
"1278",5799512,5800740,"Very carefully.","Our Man in Havana"
"1279",5800872,5804069,"She is used to sugaron Sundays and saints' days.","Our Man in Havana"
"1280",5806552,5810511,"Mr. Wormold, you deserve a long rest.","Our Man in Havana"
"1281",5810752,5812231,"Not too long, I hope.","Our Man in Havana"
"1282",5812472,5814622,"I have a present for each of you.","Our Man in Havana"
"1283",5831032,5832909,"It is rather sweet. What's yours?","Our Man in Havana"
"1284",5833032,5836991,"Just a joke in doubtful taste.He's not without humour.","Our Man in Havana"
"1285",5837552,5839349,"But not right for a husband.","Our Man in Havana"
"1286",5848232,5850871,"Are you telling usthat none of these reports are true?","Our Man in Havana"
"1287",5850992,5852983,"- None.- Why, it's incredible.","Our Man in Havana"
"1288",5853112,5855910,"You knewthis chap kept a vacuum cleaner shop.","Our Man in Havana"
"1289",5856032,5857704,"It was on his file. I reported it.","Our Man in Havana"
"1290",5857832,5860505,"As far as I knowit's a perfectly respectable profession...","Our Man in Havana"
"1291",5860632,5862350,"and fulfils a useful social purpose.","Our Man in Havana"
"1292",5862472,5865384,"Didn't you spot that these drawingswere like his machines?","Our Man in Havana"
"1293",5865512,5868310,"We all spotted it, even the Prime Minister.","Our Man in Havana"
"1294",5868512,5871424,"But there's no reasonwhy the principle of a vacuum cleaner...","Our Man in Havana"
"1295",5871552,5873031,"should not be applied to a weapon.","Our Man in Havana"
"1296",5873152,5876588,"It seems odd that Mrs. Severn didn't knowshe was working for a fraud.","Our Man in Havana"
"1297",5876712,5879590,"I knew I was working for a brave man,a good man.","Our Man in Havana"
"1298",5879712,5881031,"It was a new experience.","Our Man in Havana"
"1299",5881152,5882904,"I don't understand. What did she say?","Our Man in Havana"
"1300",5883032,5886991,"- May we have your definition of ""good""?- No post mortems, please.","Our Man in Havana"
"1301",5887232,5889621,"59200l5 will be here soon.","Our Man in Havana"
"1302",5889752,5892220,"We have to decide the best methodof dealing with him.","Our Man in Havana"
"1303",5892352,5896311,"In spite of Mrs. Severn's moving advocacy,I should class this as treason.","Our Man in Havana"
"1304",5896592,5900028,"Surely, sir, it's a casefor the Director of Public Prosecution?","Our Man in Havana"
"1305",5900392,5903065,"The trial to be held in camera, of course, sir.","Our Man in Havana"
"1306",5909672,5911583,"Father, what's that big castle?","Our Man in Havana"
"1307",5918192,5919625,"The Tower of London.","Our Man in Havana"
"1308",5924512,5928027,"- Can we drive your daughter anywhere?- No, I'll wait for you here, Father.","Our Man in Havana"
"1309",5928152,5930985,"I'm afraid she may have to waitrather a long time.","Our Man in Havana"
"1310",5931392,5934862,"Seems to me, gentlemen,that what we have to do is only too simple.","Our Man in Havana"
"1311",5934992,5937460,"We have to notify the Admiralty,the War Office...","Our Man in Havana"
"1312",5937592,5940709,"and the Air Ministry that these drawingsare not a weapon of war...","Our Man in Havana"
"1313",5940832,5943300,"but the latest style of vacuum cleaner.","Our Man in Havana"
"1314",5943432,5945900,"If I tell the War House that,we might as well pack up.","Our Man in Havana"
"1315",5946032,5949388,"I'm afraid the Admiralty, in future,would rely on Naval Intelligence.","Our Man in Havana"
"1316",5949512,5952822,"My people would have no more usefor the Secret Service, sir.","Our Man in Havana"
"1317",5953032,5955500,"59200, what do you say?","Our Man in Havana"
"1318",5956552,5957701,"Well, sir...","Our Man in Havana"
"1319",5960632,5961667,"Very well.","Our Man in Havana"
"1320",5962712,5965180,"59200l5 has arrived.","Our Man in Havana"
"1321",5965432,5968549,"Mrs. Severn,will you tell him we shall see him shortly?","Our Man in Havana"
"1322",5970512,5972946,"Yes, 59200?","Our Man in Havana"
"1323",5973272,5977060,"Of course, sir,it will be for you to tell the Prime Minister.","Our Man in Havana"
"1324",5980432,5982388,"- Why did you come back?- I had no choice.","Our Man in Havana"
"1325",5982512,5984628,"- Do things look black?- Pretty black.","Our Man in Havana"
"1326",5984752,5988028,"- What will they do to you?- They need a secretary in Jakarta.","Our Man in Havana"
"1327",5988152,5989949,"That's worse than the Persian Gulf.","Our Man in Havana"
"1328",5990072,5992950,"- It doesn't matter very much where I wait.- Wait for what?","Our Man in Havana"
"1329",5993072,5994027,"You.","Our Man in Havana"
"1330",5998752,6000504,"- Darling.- Stay here.","Our Man in Havana"
"1331",6000632,6003783,"- I told you I'd wait.- It may be rather a long time.","Our Man in Havana"
"1332",6021472,6023667,"- Sit down.- I prefer to stand.","Our Man in Havana"
"1333",6023832,6025424,"That's a quotation, isn't it?","Our Man in Havana"
"1334",6025552,6027383,"You have no right to send her to Jakarta.","Our Man in Havana"
"1335",6027512,6029423,"- Send who?- Mrs. Severn.","Our Man in Havana"
"1336",6029792,6033580,"- She knew of nothing of anything...- lf you'll allow me to speak.","Our Man in Havana"
"1337",6033992,6035027,"Thank you.","Our Man in Havana"
"1338",6035392,6037747,"We've been considering your last report.","Our Man in Havana"
"1339",6037912,6040745,"When I sent that confession,it was the first she knew of...","Our Man in Havana"
"1340",6040872,6042464,"That confession was never received.","Our Man in Havana"
"1341",6042592,6046631,"Understand that clearly, never received.I'm speaking of something quite different.","Our Man in Havana"
"1342",6046752,6050222,"The report in which you saidthe constructions had proved a failure.","Our Man in Havana"
"1343",6050352,6053310,"I never said anything of the sort.On the contrary...","Our Man in Havana"
"1344",6053432,6056469,"And that the works, whatever they were,had been dismantled.","Our Man in Havana"
"1345",6056592,6059152,"In view of that,we have decided to shut down your post.","Our Man in Havana"
"1346",6059272,6062947,"We think the best thing for you wouldbe to stay here on our training staff...","Our Man in Havana"
"1347",6063072,6065108,"lecturing how to run a station abroad.","Our Man in Havana"
"1348",6065232,6067746,"As we always dowhen a man retires from a post abroad...","Our Man in Havana"
"1349",6067872,6069510,"we'll recommend you for a decoration.","Our Man in Havana"
"1350",6069632,6072066,"In your case,under the rather special circumstances...","Our Man in Havana"
"1351",6072192,6074865,"we can hardly suggestanything higher than the OBE.","Our Man in Havana"
"1352",6074992,6077222,"Good morning. Good morning, gentlemen.","Our Man in Havana"
"1353",6077512,6079503,"Are you going back to your office?","Our Man in Havana"
"1354",6079632,6080951,"I'll walk over with you.","Our Man in Havana"
"1355",6081072,6083347,"- 59200.- Yes, sir?","Our Man in Havana"
"1356",6083472,6087147,"See that these drawings are destroyed.They must never get out of here.","Our Man in Havana"
"1357",6087272,6090742,"- I can't say how sorry I am, sir.- There's nothing to be sorry for, 59200.","Our Man in Havana"
"1358",6090872,6092749,"Happily, these plans never left our office.","Our Man in Havana"
"1359",6092872,6097024,"In our service it is essential to burythe past very quickly and very securely.","Our Man in Havana"
"1360",6097152,6100622,"We will obviouslyhave to find a different girl for Jakarta.","Our Man in Havana"
"1361",6100792,6103704,"The loss of those two, sir,will create rather a vacuum.","Our Man in Havana"
"1362",6103832,6104787,"What?","Our Man in Havana"
"1363",6105232,6108702,"I'm most frightfully sorry, sir.I really hadn't intended to make a pun.","Our Man in Havana"
"1364",6108832,6112302,"I only thought, perhaps,that if we are to make a clean sweep...","Our Man in Havana"
"1365",6121672,6125062,"I'm wearing Indiscret. Can you smell it?Have you seen this?","Our Man in Havana"
"1366",6125592,6127184,"How is Seraphina?","Our Man in Havana"
"1367",6127432,6129468,"Oh, one outgrows horses.","Our Man in Havana"

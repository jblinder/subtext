"675",3601557,3604184,"What for? Hell, I'm not bashful, baby.","In Cold Blood"
"676",3607688,3612066,"...And that, if we find the motive,we find the killer.","In Cold Blood"
"677",3612693,3613693,"If.","In Cold Blood"
"678",3616155,3618948,"This report was written six months","In Cold Blood"
"679",3619033,3621701,"before the Clutters were killed.","In Cold Blood"
"680",3622495,3626039,"It's called,Murder Without Apparent Motive.","In Cold Blood"
"681",3626707,3629167,"At the Menninger Clinic,right here in Kansas,","In Cold Blood"
"682",3629251,3631836,"a study was made of four killers.","In Cold Blood"
"683",3632713,3635006,"They all had certain things in common.","In Cold Blood"
"684",3635216,3637884,"They all committed senseless murders.","In Cold Blood"
"685",3638385,3643223,"They all felt physically inferiorand sexually inadequate.","In Cold Blood"
"686",3644058,3647936,"Their childhood was violent,or one parent was missing.","In Cold Blood"
"687",3648562,3650897,"Or someone else had raised them.","In Cold Blood"
"688",3652274,3656611,"They couldn't distinguishbetween fantasy and reality.","In Cold Blood"
"689",3657780,3660698,"They didn't hate their victims,they didn't even know them.","In Cold Blood"
"690",3660783,3664744,"They felt no guilt about their crime,and got nothing out of it.","In Cold Blood"
"691",3665579,3669958,"And most important,they told the police or a psychiatrist","In Cold Blood"
"692",3671210,3676214,"that they felt the urge to kill,before they committed murder.","In Cold Blood"
"693",3676966,3679425,"Their warnings were disregarded.","In Cold Blood"
"694",3685766,3689060,"So, who killed the Clutters?","In Cold Blood"
"695",3694275,3698403,"Someday, somebody will explainto me the motive of a newspaper.","In Cold Blood"

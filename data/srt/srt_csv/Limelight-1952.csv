"244",1629350,1631100,"One more or lessmakes no difference.","Limelight"
"245",1631310,1633100,"Moreover, I've arrived at the age","Limelight"
"246",1633310,1637560,"where platonic friendship can besustained on the highest moral plane.","Limelight"
"247",1643180,1648310,"Now let me see, your mother wasa dressmaker and your father a lord?","Limelight"
"248",1648720,1651020,"The fourth son of a lord.That's quite different.","Limelight"

"271",1732260,1734340,"The dark ones frown and go like that.","Limelight"
"272",1737760,1740380,"However, the meaning of anything","Limelight"

"413",2288660,2291780,"To hear you talk, no one wouldever think you were a comedian.","Limelight"
"414",2292070,2296570,"I'm beginning to realize that.It's the reason I can't get a job.","Limelight"
"415",2298650,2299780,"Why?","Limelight"
"416",2301780,2303740,"Because they have no imagination.","Limelight"
"417",2304280,2307200,"Or think because I'm gettingon in years I'm old, all washed up.","Limelight"
"418",2308940,2312490,"Never! After hearing you talk.","Limelight"
"419",2313740,2315610,"Perhaps I drank too much.","Limelight"

"421",2319990,2321860,"Unhappiness, I suppose.","Limelight"
"422",2323740,2325610,"No, I'm used to that.","Limelight"
"423",2327820,2330400,"It was more complicated.","Limelight"
"424",2331570,2334980,"As a man gets on in yearshe wants to live deeply.","Limelight"
"425",2336150,2340820,"A feeling of sad dignity comes uponhim, and that's fatal for a comic.","Limelight"
"426",2341360,2342690,"It affected my work.","Limelight"
"427",2342900,2345820,"I lost contact with the audience,couldn't warm up to them.","Limelight"
"428",2347070,2349480,"And that's what started me drinking.","Limelight"
"429",2349690,2351570,"I had to have it before I went on.","Limelight"
"430",2351770,2354980,"It got so I couldn't be funnywithout it. The more I drank...","Limelight"
"431",2355940,2357820,"It became a vicious circle.","Limelight"
"432",2358110,2359150,"What happened?","Limelight"
"433",2359360,2361560,"A heart attack. I almost died.","Limelight"
"434",2362270,2364150,"And you're still drinking?","Limelight"
"435",2364360,2366560,"Occasionally, if I think of things.","Limelight"
"436",2367190,2370110,"The wrong things I suppose,as you do.","Limelight"
"437",2371020,2373230,"What would you likefor your breakfast?","Limelight"
"438",2373730,2376360,"What a sad business, being funny.","Limelight"
"439",2377270,2379770,"Very sad if they won't laugh.","Limelight"
"440",2380310,2381850,"But it's a thrill when they do.","Limelight"
"441",2382060,2384770,"To look out thereand see them all laughing,","Limelight"
"442",2385810,2389270,"to hear that roar go up,waves of laughter coming at you.","Limelight"
"443",2389560,2391850,"Let's talk of somethingmore cheerful.","Limelight"
"444",2392190,2394480,"Besides I want to forget the public.","Limelight"
"445",2395520,2397390,"Never. You love them too much.","Limelight"
"446",2397600,2400100,"Maybe I love them,but I don't admire them.","Limelight"
"447",2400310,2401440,"I think you do.","Limelight"
"448",2401980,2404690,"As individuals, yes.There's greatness in everyone.","Limelight"
"449",2405390,2408520,"But as a crowd, they're likea monster without a head","Limelight"
"450",2408730,2411440,"that never knows which wayit's going to turn.","Limelight"
"451",2412180,2414270,"It can be prodded in any direction.","Limelight"
"452",2415100,2419480,"I keep forgetting about breakfast.How about some poached eggs?","Limelight"

"461",2456010,2459470,"Those managers have been holdingout on me, breaking my morale.","Limelight"
"462",2459680,2461430,"But now they want me!","Limelight"
"463",2462260,2467390,"And now I'll make them pay!For their contempt and indifference.","Limelight"
"464",2467600,2469550,"No, I'll be gracious.","Limelight"
"465",2469760,2472390,"That'll be more dignified,put them in their place.","Limelight"

"482",2548090,2549460,"No bother at all.","Limelight"

"485",2556750,2559250,"I'm not to get star billingat Middlesex?","Limelight"
"486",2559670,2561000,"I'm not surewe can book you there.","Limelight"
"487",2561540,2564250,"You think I'd allow those managersto throw in my name","Limelight"
"488",2564460,2568710,"with a lot of nondescriptsjust to build up their reputation!","Limelight"
"489",2568920,2570710,"Calvero's still a nameto conjure with!","Limelight"
"490",2571540,2574040,"You're mistaken.Today it means nothing.","Limelight"
"491",2574670,2576000,"Then why do they want me?","Limelight"
"492",2576210,2578710,"They don't want you.They're doing me a favor.","Limelight"
"493",2579540,2582580,"Very kind of them.I hope you appreciate the fact.","Limelight"
"494",2583710,2586120,"I'm going to be perfectly frankwith you.","Limelight"
"495",2586330,2589330,"I've been talking Calveroto them for over six months.","Limelight"
"496",2590080,2593000,"Your name is poison.They don't want to touch you.","Limelight"

"498",2597160,2600710,"I'm sorry, but you mustbe made to realize the facts.","Limelight"
"499",2602660,2604870,"You're succeeding splendidly.","Limelight"
"500",2605790,2609120,"I'm trying to help, that's all.But you must cooperate.","Limelight"
"501",2612660,2614660,"Whatever you say, I'll do.","Limelight"
"502",2614870,2616120,"That's the spirit.","Limelight"
"503",2616330,2619450,"As soon as the contract's confirmed,I'll let you know.","Limelight"
"504",2625500,2627450,"However, cheer up.","Limelight"
"505",2629120,2633080,"If my name is poison to them,I won't use it.","Limelight"
"506",2633290,2636620,"- I'll go by another name.- I think that's a splendid idea.","Limelight"
"507",2647160,2649450,"Well doctor, how is our patient?","Limelight"
"508",2650080,2654330,"The condition is cleared up, butI find nothing wrong with her legs.","Limelight"
"509",2654870,2656740,"Didn't she tell youshe's had rheumatic fever?","Limelight"
"510",2656950,2658410,"Yes, but I don't think she has.","Limelight"
"511",2658700,2661120,"The heart would have been affectedand it's perfectly sound.","Limelight"
"512",2661950,2664240,"I believe it's a caseof psycho-anesthesia.","Limelight"
"513",2664530,2665490,"What's that?","Limelight"
"514",2666200,2669450,"A form of hysteria that hasthe characteristics of paralysis","Limelight"
"515",2669740,2670990,"without being so.","Limelight"
"516",2671200,2672160,"How do you account for it?","Limelight"
"517",2672660,2675780,"In her case, I'd sayit's psychological, self-imposed.","Limelight"
"518",2675990,2679450,"Having failed at suicide,she's decided to become a cripple.","Limelight"
"519",2680070,2681530,"Is there any way I can help?","Limelight"
"520",2681820,2685910,"Primarily she must help herself.It's a case for a psychologist.","Limelight"
"521",2686200,2687570,"Doctor Freud.","Limelight"
"522",2688490,2689950,"Well, I'll see what I can do.","Limelight"
"523",2690990,2692660,"- Good day, Doctor.- Good day.","Limelight"
"524",2698200,2700280,"Tell me moreabout your sister Louise.","Limelight"
"525",2701740,2703610,"There's nothing more to tell.","Limelight"
"526",2704530,2707570,"When she couldn't find workshe was driven to the street.","Limelight"
"527",2708490,2710700,"How old were youwhen you discovered this?","Limelight"
"528",2710990,2712150,"About eight.","Limelight"
"529",2713900,2715280,"Tell me about it.","Limelight"
"530",2715900,2719320,"It was after my mother died.I loved Louise.","Limelight"
"531",2719530,2723070,"She was everything to me,supported me, had me taught dancing.","Limelight"
"532",2723490,2726110,"Then one day I realizedwhat she was doing.","Limelight"
"533",2726610,2728820,"I was coming home from dancingwith the other girls","Limelight"
"534",2729030,2733690,"and I saw her, and the other girlssaw her, walking the street.","Limelight"
"535",2734320,2735900,"What did you do?","Limelight"
"536",2737030,2739030,"I just ran and wept.","Limelight"
"537",2739530,2741110,"Ran and wept.","Limelight"
"538",2742230,2743480,"Then what happened?","Limelight"
"539",2744320,2745900,"I tried to forget.","Limelight"
"540",2746320,2750280,"I was sent to boarding school. At 16,I left and joined the Empire Ballet.","Limelight"
"541",2750900,2754110,"Louise went to South America.I haven't heard from her since.","Limelight"
"542",2756190,2759520,"Up to that time,you had no trouble with your legs?","Limelight"
"543",2759730,2760900,"No.","Limelight"
"544",2761820,2763190,"When did it start?","Limelight"
"545",2763480,2766820,"About two years later.After Melise joined the ballet.","Limelight"
"546",2768270,2769110,"Who's Melise?","Limelight"
"547",2769320,2771400,"One of the girlsfrom the dancing school.","Limelight"
"548",2772150,2774520,"One who was with youwhen you found out about Louise?","Limelight"
"549",2777850,2780560,"Mr. Freud would saythat since meeting this girl again,","Limelight"
"550",2780770,2782770,"you don't want to dance.","Limelight"
"551",2782980,2784230,"Why?","Limelight"
"552",2784520,2787150,"You've associated itwith the unhappy life of your sister","Limelight"
"553",2787350,2790770,"who paid for your lessonsthrough a life of shame.","Limelight"
"554",2790980,2793270,"You've been ashamed to danceever since.","Limelight"
"555",2793600,2795980,"I'd despise myselfif I thought that.","Limelight"
"556",2796190,2797850,"That's the trouble, you do.","Limelight"
"557",2798060,2801520,"That's the trouble with the world.We all despise ourselves.","Limelight"
"558",2804310,2805890,"Streetwalking!","Limelight"
"559",2807850,2810560,"We're all grubbing for a living,the best of us.","Limelight"
"560",2811930,2814310,"All a part of the human crusade,","Limelight"
"561",2815770,2817350,"written in water.","Limelight"
"562",2818060,2819430,"But enough of that.","Limelight"
"563",2820140,2821390,"Ever been in love?","Limelight"
"564",2822140,2823600,"No, not really.","Limelight"
"565",2824430,2826520,"I think it was morea feeling of pity.","Limelight"
"566",2826810,2829220,"The plot thickens.Tell me about it.","Limelight"
"567",2830270,2834100,"It's a ridiculous story.I hardly knew the man.","Limelight"
"568",2834640,2837140,"It was something I built upin my own mind.","Limelight"
"569",2837350,2839310,"It was after I came outof the hospital.","Limelight"
"570",2840770,2843680,"I took a jobat Sardou's stationary shop.","Limelight"
"571",2844510,2848390,"He was one of the customers,a young American.","Limelight"
"572",2849310,2850970,"He used to buy music paper","Limelight"
"573",2851180,2854220,"in large and small amounts,according to his finances.","Limelight"
"574",2854850,2858890,"He seemed so lonely,so helpless and shy.","Limelight"
"575",2859720,2861930,"There was something patheticabout him.","Limelight"
"576",2862430,2865760,"I wouldn't have noticed him,but someone tried to elbow in.","Limelight"
"577",2866180,2869510,"When I ignored the other man,he smiled in gratitude.","Limelight"
"578",2870760,2874300,"The old charwoman who worked wherehe lived told me he was Mr. Neville,","Limelight"
"579",2874510,2877760,"a composer,and that he occupied the top room.","Limelight"
"580",2878390,2881720,"There were days I knew he wentwithout food to buy music paper.","Limelight"
"581",2881930,2883680,"I could see it in his eyes.","Limelight"
"582",2883880,2885470,"The haggard look.","Limelight"
"583",2886090,2887840,"Sometimes I'd throw ina few extra sheets.","Limelight"
"584",2888050,2890470,"Once I gave him morethan his proper change,","Limelight"
"585",2890680,2893380,"which he might have noticed,but I wasn't sure.","Limelight"
"586",2893590,2898380,"Often after work I'd stroll by hishouse and hear him playing piano,","Limelight"
"587",2898590,2901920,"repeating musical passagesover and over again.","Limelight"
"588",2902430,2906510,"And I'd stand listening,excited and melancholy.","Limelight"
"589",2928800,2931090,"Well, what then?","Limelight"
"590",2935550,2937550,"Then for weeks I never saw him.","Limelight"
"591",2938800,2943050,"The charwoman told me he was ill.Creditors had taken his piano.","Limelight"
"592",2943800,2947630,"Eventually he came into the shoplooking very pale","Limelight"
"593",2948050,2951090,"and asked for two shillings worthof large orchestral sheets,","Limelight"
"594",2951300,2954000,"placing a two shilling pieceon the counter.","Limelight"
"595",2954630,2956500,"I knew it was his last.","Limelight"
"596",2957420,2960880,"If I could only help him!If I only dared!","Limelight"
"597",2961170,2964090,"I could lend him money.I wanted to tell him so.","Limelight"
"598",2965460,2967130,"But I was also shy.","Limelight"
"599",2968460,2971170,"NeverthelessI was determined to help.","Limelight"
"600",2971590,2975130,"I gave him some extra sheetsand as he was about leave","Limelight"
"601",2975330,2976500,"I called him back:","Limelight"
"602",2976710,2978670,"You've forgotten your change.","Limelight"
"603",2979000,2980960,"There must be a mistake, he said.","Limelight"
"604",2981170,2982540,"Not at all, I answered.","Limelight"
"605",2982750,2985670,"You gave me half a crown,here's sixpence change.","Limelight"
"606",2986290,2989500,"Then I realized I had createda ridiculous situation.","Limelight"
"607",2989830,2992750,"To make matters worsein came Mr. Sardou:","Limelight"
"608",2992960,2994920,"Can I be of any assistance?","Limelight"
"609",2995120,2996920,"It isn't necessary, I said quickly.","Limelight"
"610",2997210,3000120,"The gentleman gave me half a crownand forgot his change.","Limelight"
"611",3000330,3003170,"However,Mr. Sardou made him take it.","Limelight"
"612",3003370,3006500,"But as soon as he leftMr. Sardou went through the till","Limelight"
"613",3006710,3009710,"and finding no half crown there,became suspicious.","Limelight"
"614",3009920,3013250,"The discrepancy was discoveredand I was discharged.","Limelight"
"615",3013460,3014500,"What did you do then?","Limelight"
"616",3014710,3019000,"I tried to get back to dancing,then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.","Limelight"
"617",3020040,3022330,"Did you ever seethis young composer again?","Limelight"
"618",3022960,3026700,"Yes, five months later.After I came out of the hospital.","Limelight"
"619",3027200,3029500,"I saw him from the galleryof the Albert Hall.","Limelight"
"620",3029700,3033040,"His symphony was played there.It was a great success.","Limelight"
"621",3033240,3035450,"Of course you're in love with him.","Limelight"
"622",3035870,3037200,"I don't even know him.","Limelight"
"623",3037410,3040870,"You will.Life is a local affair.","Limelight"
"624",3041160,3042830,"I can see it happening.","Limelight"
"625",3043870,3047120,"You'll be at the heightof your success and he'll call on you,","Limelight"
"626",3047330,3049830,"and tell you he met youat some super party.","Limelight"
"627",3050040,3051280,"Won't I recognize him?","Limelight"
"628",3051580,3054700,"Oh no. He's grown a beard.Musicians do.","Limelight"
"629",3056790,3060120,"He'll tell youhe's composed a ballet for you.","Limelight"
"630",3060530,3064080,"And you'll realize who he is,you'll tell him who you are","Limelight"
"631",3064280,3067330,"and how you met,and how you waited on him.","Limelight"
"632",3067830,3070330,"And gave him extra music sheets.","Limelight"
"633",3070950,3074820,"And that night you'll dine together","Limelight"
"634",3075450,3079280,"on a balconyoverlooking the Thames.","Limelight"
"635",3080240,3081780,"It'll be summer.","Limelight"
"636",3082530,3085110,"And you'll be wearingpink mousseline.","Limelight"
"637",3085860,3088570,"And he'll be consciousof its fragrance.","Limelight"
"638",3089910,3093360,"And all Londonwill be dreamy and beautiful.","Limelight"
"639",3094410,3097530,"And in the elegant melancholyof twilight,","Limelight"
"640",3097820,3101070,"as the candles flutterand make your eyes dance,","Limelight"
"641",3101780,3103780,"he will tell you he loves you.","Limelight"
"642",3104400,3107320,"And you will tell himyou have always loved him.","Limelight"
"643",3110240,3111700,"Where am I?","Limelight"
"644",3113360,3116280,"Yes, life can be wonderfulif you're not afraid of it.","Limelight"
"645",3118440,3122320,"All it needs is courage, imagination","Limelight"
"646",3125320,3126900,"and a little dough.","Limelight"
"647",3130650,3131780,"Now what's the matter?","Limelight"
"648",3132190,3135030,"I'll never dance again!I'm a cripple.","Limelight"
"649",3135320,3137740,"- Pure hysteria! It's in your mind.- It isn't true.","Limelight"
"650",3138030,3140440,"- Otherwise you'd fight!- What is there to fight for?","Limelight"
"651",3140650,3142820,"Ah, you see? You admit it.","Limelight"
"652",3143150,3145650,"What is there to fight for?Everything!","Limelight"
"653",3146150,3147940,"Life itself! Isn't that enough?","Limelight"
"654",3148230,3152320,"To be lived, suffered, enjoyed!What is there to fight for?","Limelight"
"655",3152520,3155110,"Life is a beautiful,magnificent thing.","Limelight"
"656",3155320,3157190,"Even to a jellyfish.","Limelight"
"657",3158020,3161980,"What is there to fight for?You have your art, your dancing!","Limelight"
"658",3162400,3164270,"But I can't dance without legs!","Limelight"
"659",3164690,3166480,"I know a man without arms","Limelight"
"660",3166770,3171060,"who can play a scherzo on a violinand does it all with his toes.","Limelight"
"661",3171270,3173980,"The trouble is you won't fight.You've given in.","Limelight"
"662",3174190,3176560,"Continually dwellingon sickness and death!","Limelight"
"663",3176770,3178020,"But,","Limelight"
"664",3178360,3181060,"there's somethingjust as inevitable as death","Limelight"
"665",3181270,3183440,"and that's life.Life, life, life!","Limelight"
"666",3183850,3185850,"Think of the powerthat's in the universe!","Limelight"
"667",3186060,3188770,"Moving the earth, growing the trees!","Limelight"
"668",3189060,3191350,"And that's the same powerwithin you.","Limelight"
"669",3191560,3195440,"If you'd only have courageand the will to use it.","Limelight"
"670",3197810,3198850,"Good night!","Limelight"

"1246",6514230,6517860,"Knowing I'm doing this sort of thingmight upset her.","Limelight"
"1247",6518060,6519440,"Although I don't mind it.","Limelight"
"1248",6519650,6522360,"There's somethingabout working the streets I like.","Limelight"
"1249",6522570,6524530,"It's the tramp in me, I suppose.","Limelight"

"1267",6625200,6629160,"It's all for the best.All for the best.","Limelight"
"1268",6630540,6631870,"Perhaps.","Limelight"
"1269",6633660,6635120,"I don't know.","Limelight"
"1270",6637290,6639080,"But something's gone.","Limelight"

"1284",6685860,6688690,"Mr. Postant saidhe'd give you a benefit.","Limelight"
"1285",6689400,6691280,"I don't want his charity.","Limelight"
"1286",6692230,6694190,"It isn't charity.","Limelight"
"1287",6694400,6697860,"He says it'd be the greatestevent in theatrical history.","Limelight"
"1288",6698280,6700660,"I'm not interested in events.","Limelight"
"1289",6701820,6704830,"But I would like a chance justto show them I'm not through yet.","Limelight"

"1293",6715160,6717040,"for myself and my friend.","Limelight"
"1294",6717460,6719120,"It's sort of a musical satire.","Limelight"
"1295",6719330,6720380,"Wonderful!","Limelight"
"1296",6720580,6724840,"You know he's a very good pianist,and me with the violin...","Limelight"
"1297",6725790,6728590,"A lot of very reallyreally very funny business.","Limelight"
"1298",6740800,6741840,"Come in.","Limelight"

"1302",6756520,6758600,"Are the jokes as bad as all that?","Limelight"
"1303",6759230,6763730,"I'm worried. If he fails tonight,it'll kill him. I know it.","Limelight"
"1304",6763940,6767690,"He won't fail. The audiencewill be most sympathetic.","Limelight"
"1305",6767900,6770690,"But he doesn't want sympathy.He keeps saying that.","Limelight"
"1306",6771110,6773400,"He wants to be a genuine success.","Limelight"
"1307",6773610,6778320,"What does he expect?You know he's not the man he was.","Limelight"
"1308",6778820,6780280,"He mustn't be told that!","Limelight"
"1309",6781450,6783320,"Tell me, my dear,","Limelight"
"1310",6783740,6787490,"are you still going to marry him?","Limelight"

"1323",6827300,6829260,"I'll ring downafter you fall in the drum.","Limelight"
"1324",6829470,6831470,"No, after I'm carried offin the drum.","Limelight"
"1325",6831680,6833430,"Right you are. Thank you, sir.","Limelight"
"1326",6836140,6840430,"If anybody else says it's like oldtimes, I'll jump out the window!","Limelight"

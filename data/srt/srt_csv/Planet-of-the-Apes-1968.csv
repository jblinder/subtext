"765",5130417,5132543,"I don't plan to be caught again.","Planet of the Apes"
"766",5134546,5137715,"- As you wish.- Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was","Planet of the Apes"
"767",5137800,5140635,"another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.","Planet of the Apes"
"768",5140761,5142804,"I'll try for that. What about you?","Planet of the Apes"
"769",5142930,5145723,"Cornelius and I have beenindicted for heresy.","Planet of the Apes"
"770",5145808,5149811,"Unless we can prove our theories,we don't stand a chance of acquittal.","Planet of the Apes"
"771",5149937,5152188,"You're going back to the forbidden zone?","Planet of the Apes"
"772",5152272,5155525,"We're going back to the diggingsI worked at over a year ago.","Planet of the Apes"
"773",5155609,5157819,"It's a three-day ride across the desert.","Planet of the Apes"
"774",5157945,5161114,"Near where you claim you landedfrom that planet of yours.","Planet of the Apes"
"775",5161198,5164992,"- You still don't believe me, do you?- It's a long detour to Dead Lake.","Planet of the Apes"
"776",5165077,5167161,"- What would we find?- Nothing much.","Planet of the Apes"
"777",5167246,5172750,"An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a...little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.","Planet of the Apes"
"778",5173794,5176170,"The terrain around that lake is poisonous.","Planet of the Apes"
"779",5176255,5180425,"There's no fresh water,no vegetation - nothing.","Planet of the Apes"
"780",5183679,5187974,"Anyway, I... ought to thank youfor saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.","Planet of the Apes"
"781",5189643,5192812,"We've been in troublesince the moment we met you.","Planet of the Apes"
"782",5196483,5198568,"What's she pointing at?","Planet of the Apes"
"783",5198652,5201654,"This must be close to home for her.She knows it.","Planet of the Apes"
"784",5205701,5208119,"Nova, no. Nova!","Planet of the Apes"
"785",5208203,5211164,"Nova, you can't go there!It's not safe! Nova!","Planet of the Apes"
"786",5215127,5216669,"We'd better get started.","Planet of the Apes"
"787",5216754,5219839,"If the mounted police pick up our trail,they'll come this far.","Planet of the Apes"
"788",5219923,5223676,"Right. Let's get the waterand provisions into the wagon.","Planet of the Apes"
"789",5295666,5297750,"Cornelius!","Planet of the Apes"
"790",5300921,5303005,"Where does this river lead to?","Planet of the Apes"
"791",5303090,5308177,"It flows into a sea some miles from here.That's where we'll find the diggings.","Planet of the Apes"
"792",5308262,5310346,"And beyond that?","Planet of the Apes"
"793",5310430,5314308,"I don't know. You can't ridealong the shore at high tide","Planet of the Apes"
"794",5314393,5317270,"and we had no boatson our last expedition.","Planet of the Apes"
"795",5317354,5320940,"You never told me -why do you call this the forbidden zone?","Planet of the Apes"
"796",5321817,5327488,"No one knows. It's an ancient taboo,set forth in the sacred scrolls.","Planet of the Apes"
"797",5327573,5330741,"The lawgiver pronouncedthis whole area deadly.","Planet of the Apes"
"798",5332953,5335037,"Shouldn't we be moving on?","Planet of the Apes"
"799",5335706,5337790,"I'm for that.","Planet of the Apes"
"800",5426546,5428631,"Well? Do you like it?","Planet of the Apes"
"801",5433595,5436222,"Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?","Planet of the Apes"
"802",5436306,5440059,"In my world, when I left it,only kids your age wore beards.","Planet of the Apes"
"803",5440894,5442436,"Beards?","Planet of the Apes"
"804",5442521,5444605,"I don't go in for fads.","Planet of the Apes"
"805",5445482,5447650,"Somehow","Planet of the Apes"
"806",5447734,5450236,"it makes you look less intelligent.","Planet of the Apes"
"807",5451238,5453823,"When will you show mewhat's in that cave?","Planet of the Apes"
"808",5453907,5456033,"Right now, if you like.","Planet of the Apes"
"809",5475846,5476929,"Cornelius!","Planet of the Apes"
"810",5487607,5491152,"- Lucius, don't fire at them!- You're all under arrest!","Planet of the Apes"
"811",5495449,5498868,"If there's any more shooting,Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.","Planet of the Apes"
"812",5498952,5500703,"You can count on it.","Planet of the Apes"
"813",5500787,5503205,"You are not in command.Put down that gun.","Planet of the Apes"
"814",5503290,5504457,"Shut up!","Planet of the Apes"
"815",5504541,5506500,"Very well.","Planet of the Apes"
"816",5506877,5508210,"Lower your weapons.","Planet of the Apes"
"817",5508295,5511964,"Tell them to pull back around the rocks,out of range.","Planet of the Apes"
"818",5512758,5514800,"Withdraw!","Planet of the Apes"
"819",5519639,5521724,"How did you know we'd come here?","Planet of the Apes"
"820",5521808,5526479,"It wasn't difficult. Only an apostatewould flee to the forbidden zone.","Planet of the Apes"
"821",5526563,5529774,"And only a foolwould give a gun to an animal.","Planet of the Apes"
"822",5530734,5533819,"I see you've broughtthe female of your species.","Planet of the Apes"
"823",5533945,5537698,"I didn't realizethat man could be monogamous.","Planet of the Apes"
"824",5537783,5539825,"On this planet it's easy.","Planet of the Apes"
"825",5540994,5544747,"I'll ask you to reconsiderthe rash course you've undertaken.","Planet of the Apes"
"826",5544831,5550252,"If you're convicted of heresy,the most you'll get is two years, but","Planet of the Apes"
"827",5550337,5555591,"if you persist in pointing guns inmy direction, you'll hang for high treason.","Planet of the Apes"
"828",5555675,5558302,"We never meant to be treasonous, sir.","Planet of the Apes"
"829",5558386,5562556,"But up there, in the face of that cliff,there is a vast cave,","Planet of the Apes"
"830",5562641,5566685,"and in that cave a fabulous treasureof fossils and artifacts.","Planet of the Apes"
"831",5566770,5570481,"I've seen some of your fossilsand artifacts. They're worthless.","Planet of the Apes"
"832",5570565,5572650,"There's your minister of science.","Planet of the Apes"
"833",5572734,5575861,"Honor-bound to expandthe frontiers of knowledge.","Planet of the Apes"
"834",5575946,5578114,"- Taylor, please!- Except he's also chief defender","Planet of the Apes"
"835",5578198,5579698,"of the faith.","Planet of the Apes"
"836",5579783,5583994,"There is no contradictionbetween faith and science - true science.","Planet of the Apes"
"837",5584079,5587540,"- Are you willing to put it to the test?- Taylor, I would rather...","Planet of the Apes"
"838",5587624,5591794,"Take it easy. You saved me fromthis fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.","Planet of the Apes"
"839",5591878,5594004,"What is your proposal?","Planet of the Apes"
"840",5594798,5597967,"When were those sacred scrollsof yours written?","Planet of the Apes"
"841",5598051,5599802,"1,200 years ago.","Planet of the Apes"
"842",5599886,5604974,"All right. If they can prove those scrollsdon't tell the whole truth of your history,","Planet of the Apes"
"843",5605058,5607351,"if they can find some real evidence","Planet of the Apes"
"844",5607435,5611188,"of another culture from some remote past,will you let them off?","Planet of the Apes"
"845",5611273,5614233,"- Of course.- Let's go up to the cave.","Planet of the Apes"
"846",5619614,5622908,"Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay hereand guard the camp.","Planet of the Apes"
"847",5623034,5626120,"Always giving orders.Just like every other adult.","Planet of the Apes"
"848",5626246,5628789,"Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.","Planet of the Apes"
"849",5690894,5693395,"Present your evidence, Cornelius.","Planet of the Apes"
"850",5693480,5698734,"It was at this level that I discoveredtraces of an early ape creature.","Planet of the Apes"
"851",5698818,5704490,"A stage of primitive barbarism really,dating back some 1,300 years roughly.","Planet of the Apes"
"852",5704616,5710162,"It was at this level... I discoveredcutting tools and arrowheads of quartz","Planet of the Apes"
"853",5710288,5713791,"and the fossilized bonesof carnivorous gorillas.","Planet of the Apes"
"854",5714542,5717086,"But the artifacts","Planet of the Apes"
"855",5717170,5719338,"lying here","Planet of the Apes"
"856",5720423,5723342,"were found at this level,","Planet of the Apes"
"857",5723426,5726512,"and date back... 700 years earlier.","Planet of the Apes"
"858",5726638,5728722,"That's the paradox.","Planet of the Apes"
"859",5728807,5732393,"For the more ancient cultureis the more advanced.","Planet of the Apes"
"860",5732519,5736355,"Now, admittedly,many of these objects are unidentified.","Planet of the Apes"
"861",5736439,5740693,"But clearly they were fashionedby beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.","Planet of the Apes"
"862",5740777,5744989,"Indeed, the fact that many of these toolsare unknown to us","Planet of the Apes"
"863",5745115,5749660,"suggests a culture whichin certain ways equals our own.","Planet of the Apes"

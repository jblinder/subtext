"874",5757407,5759824,"Calvera isn't worriedabout food for winter.","The Magnificent Seven"
"875",5759949,5764787,"He's worried about the food his menhaven't eaten for the last three days.","The Magnificent Seven"
"876",5765663,5768373,"The price of corn is going up.","The Magnificent Seven"
"877",5768498,5771835,"- They're starving.- How do you know?","The Magnificent Seven"

"883",5794896,5797898,"We're surrounded.Outnumbered. What are we to do?","The Magnificent Seven"
"884",5798023,5800442,"Keep on fighting.","The Magnificent Seven"
"885",5800567,5802819,"Do you want to see uskilled off one by one?","The Magnificent Seven"
"886",5802944,5805529,"That is not what you were hired for.","The Magnificent Seven"
"887",5806072,5809532,"- Once you start, there's no stopping.- You understood that, and I told him!","The Magnificent Seven"

"905",5916287,5918331,"I'm not saying we bit offmore than we can chew,","The Magnificent Seven"
"906",5918456,5921584,"but we ought to talk aboutwhat we're gonna do.","The Magnificent Seven"
"907",5921709,5924252,"We start acting likewe had some good sense.","The Magnificent Seven"
"908",5924377,5928256,"We figured to raise the ante just enoughto make Calvera play someplace else.","The Magnificent Seven"
"909",5928381,5931759,"where we figured wrong.- We're the only game in town.","The Magnificent Seven"
"910",5931884,5934344,"- A man can't call 'em all.- I didn't say he could.","The Magnificent Seven"
"911",5934469,5938806,"All I'm saying is that sometimesyou bend with the breeze... or you break.","The Magnificent Seven"

"1000",6437677,6441430,"A fella I knew in El Paso,one day he took all his clothes off
and jumped in a mess of cactus.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1001",6441556,6443723,"I asked him the same question ""Why?""","The Magnificent Seven"
"1002",6444516,6445934,"And?","The Magnificent Seven"
"1003",6446059,6449979,"He said It seemed to bea good idea at the time.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1004",6488468,6490512,"Good!","The Magnificent Seven"
"1005",6491388,6493098,"Right.","The Magnificent Seven"

"1009",6519036,6522289,"You know, the first timeI took a job as a hired gun,","The Magnificent Seven"
"1010",6522414,6526250,"a fella told meVin, you can't afford to care.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1011",6526959,6528711,"There's your problem.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1012",6528836,6531756,"One thing I don't needis somebody telling me my problem.","The Magnificent Seven"

"1015",6539719,6543264,"Do you ever get tiredof hearing yourself talk?","The Magnificent Seven"
"1016",6543389,6547476,"The reason I understandyour problem so well...","The Magnificent Seven"
"1017",6547601,6550729,"is that I walked into the same trap myself.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1018",6551688,6553273,"Yeah.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1019",6553398,6556776,"The first day we got here,I started thinking...","The Magnificent Seven"
"1020",6556901,6560987,"maybe I could put my gun awayand settle down and get a little land,","The Magnificent Seven"
"1021",6561112,6562780,"raise some cattle.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1022",6562905,6567576,"The things that these people knowabout me... wouldn't work against me.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1023",6567701,6572705,"I... just didn't want you to thinkyou were the only sucker in town.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1024",6590971,6593597,"- Can we go with you, Bernardo?- No.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1025",6593722,6596559,"- You like us, don't you?- I guess so.","The Magnificent Seven"

"1027",6600478,6602981,"- Take us with you! Please?!- No!","The Magnificent Seven"
"1028",6603106,6607401,"We're ashamed to live here.Our fathers are cowards.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1029",6612405,6614489,"Don't ever say that againabout your fathers.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1030",6614698,6616449,"They are not cowards!","The Magnificent Seven"
"1031",6619160,6621746,"You think I am bravebecause I carry a gun.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1032",6621872,6625666,"Your fathers are much braverbecause they carry responsibility.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1033",6625791,6628586,"For you, your brothers,your sisters and your mothers.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1034",6628711,6632338,"This responsibilityis like a big rock that weighs a ton.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1035",6632463,6636717,"It bends and it twists them until finallyit buries them under the ground.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1036",6636842,6641137,"Nobody says they have to do it. They do itbecause they love you and they want to.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1037",6642972,6646516,"I have never had this kind of courage.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1038",6647684,6649603,"Running a farm,","The Magnificent Seven"
"1039",6649728,6655191,"working like a mule, with no guaranteewhat will become of it - this is bravery.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1040",6657568,6660444,"That's why I nevereven started anything like that.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1041",6660569,6662613,"That's why I never will.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1042",6677584,6680754,"You'll do much betteron the other side of the border.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1043",6680879,6684048,"There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1044",6684173,6688134,"All you have to face is a sheriff,a marshal.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1045",6688259,6690552,"Once I rob a bank in Texas.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1046",6690677,6694223,"Your government got after mewith a whole army. A whole army!","The Magnificent Seven"

"1053",6789301,6790552,"Farmers!","The Magnificent Seven"
"1054",6790677,6793471,"No honour, no loyalty - nothing.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1055",6795055,6800144,"All they care about is their...precious crops and the
miserable... dirt they dig in.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1056",6802687,6804856,"I hate them.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1057",6806149,6809360,"- I hate them all.- Sure you hate them.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1058",6811486,6814989,"Because you comefrom a village just like that one.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1059",6815114,6817407,"You yourself are a farmer.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1060",6819951,6821995,"Yes.","The Magnificent Seven"

"1063",6829502,6831754,"Men with guns.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1064",6832587,6835547,"Men like Calvera and...","The Magnificent Seven"
"1065",6836089,6838258,"men like you.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1066",6839343,6841844,"And now me.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1067",6845181,6847682,"So what do you expect us to be?","The Magnificent Seven"
"1068",6854648,6857900,"Nobody throws me my own gunsand says run. Nobody.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1069",6859026,6863403,"It took me a long, long timeto learn my elbow from a hot rock.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1070",6864446,6869117,"Right now, I belong back in thatborder town, sleepin' on white sheets.","The Magnificent Seven"
"1071",6872245,6875414,"I think I'll ride back to that village.","The Magnificent Seven"

"1",111444,114905,"Last night,I dreamt I went to Manderley again.","Rebecca"
"2",115865,119283,"It seemed to me I stood by the iron gateleading to the drive,","Rebecca"
"3",120203,124248,"and for a while, I could not enter,for the way was barred to me.","Rebecca"
"4",124790,126792,"Then, like all dreamers,","Rebecca"
"5",127543,130962,"I was possessed of a suddenwith supernatural powers","Rebecca"
"6",131131,134633,"and passed like a spiritthrough the barrier before me.","Rebecca"
"7",135425,138052,"The drive wound away in front of me,","Rebecca"
"8",138221,141139,"twisting and turningas it had always done.","Rebecca"
"9",141640,143307,"But as I advanced,","Rebecca"
"10",143475,146311,"I was awarethat a change had come upon it.","Rebecca"
"11",146646,150481,"Nature had come into her own again,and little by little","Rebecca"
"12",150650,155069,"had encroached upon the drivewith long, tenacious fingers.","Rebecca"
"13",157615,162076,"On and on wound the poor threadthat had once been our drive,","Rebecca"
"14",163538,166247,"and finally, there was Manderley.","Rebecca"
"15",167082,169835,"Manderley, secretive and silent.","Rebecca"
"16",170377,173838,"Time could not marthe perfect symmetry of those walls.","Rebecca"
"17",174841,177759,"Moonlight can play odd tricksupon the fancy,","Rebecca"
"18",178093,182347,"and suddenly it seemed to methat light came from the windows.","Rebecca"
"19",185602,188187,"And then a cloud came upon the moon","Rebecca"
"20",188562,192356,"and hovered an instantlike a dark hand before a face.","Rebecca"
"21",193359,195360,"The illusion went with it.","Rebecca"
"22",196862,199239,"I looked upon a desolate shell","Rebecca"
"23",200033,203911,"with no whisper of the pastabout its staring walls.","Rebecca"
"24",205538,208164,"We can never go back to Manderley again.","Rebecca"
"25",208332,210042,"That much is certain.","Rebecca"
"26",210251,214337,"But sometimes in my dreams,I do go back","Rebecca"
"27",214504,216590,"to the strange days of my life","Rebecca"
"28",216758,219884,"which began for mein the South of France.","Rebecca"
"29",254753,256045,"No! Stop!","Rebecca"
"30",257214,259800,"What the devil are you shouting about?","Rebecca"
"31",262011,264637,"Who are you? What are you staring at?","Rebecca"
"32",265430,268307,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare,but I... I only thought...","Rebecca"
"33",268475,271103,"Oh, you did, did you?Well, what are you doing here?","Rebecca"
"34",271271,272812,"I was only walking.","Rebecca"
"35",272980,276316,"Well, get on with your walking.Don't hang about here screaming.","Rebecca"
"36",302134,304677,"I'll never come to Monte Carloout of season again.","Rebecca"
"37",304846,308139,"Not a single well-known personalityin the hotel.","Rebecca"
"38",310310,311893,"Stone cold. Waiter!","Rebecca"
"39",312060,314771,"Garçon! Call him.Tell him to get me some...","Rebecca"
"40",315148,317149,"Why, it's Max de Winter.","Rebecca"
"41",318401,325324,"How do you do?","Rebecca"
"42",325490,328617,"I'm Edythe Van Hopper.It's so nice to run into you here,","Rebecca"
"43",328786,332331,"just when I was beginning to despair offinding any old friends here in Monte.","Rebecca"
"44",332497,334165,"But do sit down and have some coffee.","Rebecca"
"45",334334,335667,"Mr. De Winter is havingsome coffee with me.","Rebecca"
"46",335834,338295,"Go and ask that stupid waiterfor another cup.","Rebecca"
"47",338463,340338,"I'm afraid I must contradict you.","Rebecca"
"48",340505,343050,"You shall both have coffee with me.","Rebecca"
"49",343343,344843,"Garçon. Coffee, please.","Rebecca"
"50",345011,346552,"- Cigarette?- No, thank you.","Rebecca"
"51",346721,349430,"You know,I recognized you as soon as you came in,","Rebecca"
"52",349598,353560,"though I haven't seen you since thatnight at the casino at Palm Beach.","Rebecca"
"53",353853,356228,"Perhaps you don't rememberan old woman like me.","Rebecca"
"54",356396,358230,"Are you playing the tables muchhere at Monte?","Rebecca"
"55",358399,361233,"No. I'm afraid that sort of thingceased to amuse me years ago.","Rebecca"
"56",361401,362860,"I can well understand that.","Rebecca"
"57",363028,365197,"As for me, if I hada home like Manderley,","Rebecca"
"58",365365,367199,"I should certainly never come to Monte.","Rebecca"
"59",367367,369992,"I hear it's one of the biggest placesin that part of the country,","Rebecca"
"60",370161,371870,"and you just can't beat it for beauty.","Rebecca"
"61",372038,375290,"What do you think of Monte Carlo?Or don't you think of it at all?","Rebecca"
"62",375458,377709,"Well, I think it's rather artificial.","Rebecca"
"63",377877,380045,"She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter,that's her trouble.","Rebecca"
"64",380338,383089,"Most girls will give their eyesfor a chance to see Monte.","Rebecca"
"65",383382,385800,"Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?","Rebecca"
"66",386134,389303,"Now that we've found each other again,I hope I shall see something of you.","Rebecca"
"67",389471,391639,"You must come and have a drinkin my suite.","Rebecca"
"68",391807,393557,"I hope they've given you a good room.","Rebecca"
"69",393725,396894,"The place is empty, so if you'reuncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.","Rebecca"
"70",397062,399064,"Your valet has unpacked for you,I suppose?","Rebecca"
"71",399231,402233,"I'm afraid I don't possess one.Perhaps you would like to do it for me?","Rebecca"
"72",402776,406237,"Well, I... I hardly think...","Rebecca"
"73",406656,408447,"Perhaps you could make yourselfuseful to Mr. De Winter","Rebecca"
"74",408615,409908,"if he wants anything done.","Rebecca"
"75",410076,411909,"You're a capable child in many ways.","Rebecca"
"76",412077,415038,"That's a charming suggestion,but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,","Rebecca"
"77",415206,419418,"""He travels fastest who travels alone.""Perhaps you've not heard it. Good night.","Rebecca"
"78",420420,422336,"What do you make of that?","Rebecca"
"79",422504,425548,"Do you suppose that sudden departurewas intended to be funny?","Rebecca"
"80",425716,428134,"Come, don't sit there gawking,let's go upstairs.","Rebecca"
"81",428302,430220,"- Have you got the key?- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.","Rebecca"
"82",430387,433389,"I remember, when I was younger,there was a well-known writer","Rebecca"
"83",433557,436643,"who used to dart down the back waywhenever he saw me coming.","Rebecca"
"84",436810,440439,"I suppose he was in love with meand wasn't quite sure of himself.","Rebecca"
"85",440605,442356,"Well, c'est la vie.","Rebecca"
"86",443733,446610,"By the way, my dear,don't think that I mean to be unkind,","Rebecca"
"87",446821,450031,"but you were just a teeny-weeny bitforward with Mr. De Winter.","Rebecca"
"88",450199,452701,"Your effort to enter the conversationquite embarrassed me,","Rebecca"
"89",452869,456329,"and I'm sure it did him.Men loathe that sort of thing.","Rebecca"
"90",456497,460375,"Oh, come, don't sulk. After all,I am responsible for your behavior here.","Rebecca"
"91",460584,462127,"Perhaps he didn't notice it.","Rebecca"
"92",462295,465672,"Poor thing, I suppose he justcan't get over his wife's death.","Rebecca"
"93",467300,469593,"They say he simply adored her.","Rebecca"
"94",489447,491156,"Oh... How awkward of me.","Rebecca"
"95",493242,495744,"What a stupid thing to do.Oh, I'm so sorry.","Rebecca"
"96",495911,497454,"Please don't bother.It doesn't really matter.","Rebecca"
"97",497622,499622,"No, leave that, leave that.Go and lay another place at my table.","Rebecca"
"98",499790,502417,"- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.","Rebecca"
"99",502584,504836,"- Why not?- Oh, well, please don't be polite. I...","Rebecca"
"100",505004,507505,"It's very kind of you but I'll beall right if they just change the cloth.","Rebecca"
"101",507673,508589,"I wasn't being polite.","Rebecca"
"102",508757,509673,"I should have asked youto have lunch with me","Rebecca"
"103",509841,511509,"even if you hadn't upset the vaseso clumsily.","Rebecca"
"104",511677,512844,"Come along.","Rebecca"
"105",513346,515429,"We needn't talk to each otherif we don't feel like it.","Rebecca"
"106",515597,517349,"Well, thank you very much.","Rebecca"
"107",522230,524855,"Oh, I... I'll just havesome scrambled eggs.","Rebecca"
"108",525024,526357,"Oui, mademoiselle.","Rebecca"
"109",528653,532447,"- What's happened to your friend?- She's ill in bed with a cold.","Rebecca"
"110",533198,535408,"I'm sorry I was sorude to you yesterday.","Rebecca"
"111",535909,539370,"The only excuse I can offer is that I'vebecome boorish through living alone.","Rebecca"
"112",539538,542081,"You weren't really.You simply wanted to be alone and...","Rebecca"
"113",542250,546126,"Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hoppera friend of yours or just a relation?","Rebecca"
"114",546294,549380,"No, she's my employer.I'm what is known as ""a paid companion.""","Rebecca"
"115",549548,551258,"I didn't know companionshipcould be bought.","Rebecca"
"116",551424,553217,"I looked at the word ""companion""in the dictionary once.","Rebecca"
"117",553385,555761,"It said, ""a friend of the bosom.""","Rebecca"
"118",556596,558514,"I don't envy you the privilege.","Rebecca"
"119",558682,561725,"Well, she's very kind, really,and I have to earn my living.","Rebecca"
"120",561894,563436,"Haven't you any family?","Rebecca"
"121",563604,566022,"No. My mother died years and years ago,","Rebecca"
"122",566190,569567,"and there was only my father,and he died last summer.","Rebecca"
"123",570485,572236,"And then I took this job.","Rebecca"
"124",572738,573904,"How rotten for you.","Rebecca"
"125",574072,577241,"Yes, it was rather, because, you see,we got on so well together.","Rebecca"
"126",577409,578618,"You and your father?","Rebecca"
"127",578786,581788,"Yes. He was a lovely person,very unusual.","Rebecca"
"128",581956,583706,"- What was he?- A painter.","Rebecca"
"129",583874,585250,"Ah! Was he a good one?","Rebecca"
"130",585418,588836,"Well, I thought so,but people didn't understand him.","Rebecca"
"131",589004,590922,"Yes, that's often the trouble.","Rebecca"
"132",591090,594759,"He painted trees.At least, it was one tree.","Rebecca"
"133",594927,597052,"You mean, he painted the same treeover and over again?","Rebecca"
"134",597221,601224,"Yes. You see, he had a theory thatif you should find one perfect thing","Rebecca"
"135",601392,603309,"or place or person,you should stick to it.","Rebecca"
"136",603476,604936,"Do you think that's really silly?","Rebecca"
"137",605104,607605,"Not at all.I'm a firm believer in that myself.","Rebecca"
"138",607773,610817,"And what did you find to do withyourself while he was painting his tree?","Rebecca"
"139",610985,614528,"Well, I sat with him and I sketched alittle. I don't do it very well, though.","Rebecca"
"140",614697,616072,"Were you going sketchingthis afternoon?","Rebecca"
"141",616240,617240,"Yes.","Rebecca"
"142",617408,618950,"- Where?- Well, I haven't made up my mind.","Rebecca"
"143",619118,620619,"I'll drive you somewhere in the car.","Rebecca"
"144",620786,622120,"Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...","Rebecca"
"145",622288,624538,"Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess,and we'll get along.","Rebecca"
"146",624706,627583,"Thank you. It's very kind of you,but I'm not very hungry.","Rebecca"
"147",627751,630336,"Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.","Rebecca"
"148",641724,643182,"You've taken long enoughfor that sketch.","Rebecca"
"149",643350,645143,"I shall expect a really finework of art.","Rebecca"
"150",645311,647102,"Oh, no, don't look at it.It's not nearly good enough.","Rebecca"
"151",647270,649188,"Well, it can't be as bad as all that.Now don't rub it all out.","Rebecca"
"152",649356,650398,"Let me see it first.","Rebecca"
"153",650566,652609,"Well, it's the perspective.I never can get it right.","Rebecca"
"154",652777,654778,"Let me see it, let me see it. Oh, dear.","Rebecca"
"155",654945,658030,"Tell me, is it the perspectivethat gives my nose that curious","Rebecca"
"156",658198,659198,"twist in the middle?","Rebecca"
"157",659825,661951,"Well, you're not a very easy subjectto sketch. Your...","Rebecca"
"158",662119,663662,"Your expression keeps changingall the time.","Rebecca"
"159",663828,664828,"Does it?","Rebecca"
"160",664996,667916,"Well, I'd... I'd concentrate on the viewinstead, if I were you.","Rebecca"
"161",668417,670293,"Much more worthwhile.","Rebecca"
"162",671169,674422,"It rather reminds me of our coastlineat home. Do you know Cornwall at all?","Rebecca"
"163",674590,678134,"Yes, I went there once with my fatheron holiday. I was in a shop once,","Rebecca"
"164",678344,683097,"and I saw a postcard with a beautifulhouse on it, right by the sea.","Rebecca"
"165",683515,687101,"I asked whose house it was, andthe old lady said, ""That's Manderley.""","Rebecca"
"166",687269,688937,"I felt ashamed for not knowing.","Rebecca"
"167",689105,690605,"Manderley is beautiful.","Rebecca"
"168",690855,694442,"But to me,it's just the place where I was born,","Rebecca"
"169",695695,698028,"and have lived in all my life.","Rebecca"
"170",698864,701740,"But now, I don't supposeI shall ever see it again.","Rebecca"
"171",708499,712543,"We're lucky not to be homeduring the bad weather, aren't we?","Rebecca"
"172",714171,718633,"I can't ever remember enjoyingswimming in England till June, can you?","Rebecca"
"173",721761,724639,"The water's so warm herethat I could stay in all day.","Rebecca"
"174",724807,728434,"There's a dangerous undertow andthere was a man drowned here last year.","Rebecca"
"175",730395,733273,"I never have any fear of drowning.Have you?","Rebecca"
"176",740697,742740,"Come, I'll take you home.","Rebecca"
"177",756713,760383,"Oh, yes, I know Mr. De Winter well.I knew his wife, too.","Rebecca"
"178",760551,763802,"Before she married, she was thebeautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.","Rebecca"
"179",763971,766597,"She was drowned, poor dear,while she was sailing near Manderley.","Rebecca"
"180",766765,769392,"He never talks about it, of course,but he's a broken man.","Rebecca"
"181",769559,771477,"I suppose I'd better have it.","Rebecca"
"182",771644,773395,"Wretched stuff!Give me a chocolate, quick!","Rebecca"
"183",774774,776941,"Oh, there you are. It's about time.","Rebecca"
"184",777109,779735,"Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.","Rebecca"
"185",786826,789203,"She was the beautifulRebecca Hildreth, you know.","Rebecca"
"186",789370,791288,"They say he simply adored her.","Rebecca"
"187",791456,793541,"She was the beautiful RebeccaHildreth, you know.","Rebecca"
"188",793708,796001,"I suppose he just can'tget over his wife's death.","Rebecca"
"189",796169,798046,"She was the beautiful RebeccaHildreth, you know.","Rebecca"
"190",798213,800088,"But he's a broken man.","Rebecca"
"191",802884,803884,"Bonjour.","Rebecca"
"192",804427,806763,"- Well, where are you going?- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.","Rebecca"
"193",806931,807971,"I see.","Rebecca"
"194",808139,811643,"I suppose you've had a look at the pro,and he's desperately handsome,","Rebecca"
"195",811811,814312,"and you've conceiveda schoolgirl crush on him.","Rebecca"
"196",814480,816188,"All right. Go ahead.Make the most of it.","Rebecca"
"197",819317,820442,"Off duty?","Rebecca"
"198",820610,823028,"Well, yes. Mrs. Van Hopper'scold's turned into flu,","Rebecca"
"199",823197,824239,"so she's got a trained nurse.","Rebecca"
"200",824405,826115,"I'm sorry for the nurse.You keen on tennis?","Rebecca"
"201",826283,829536,"- Well, not particularly.- That's good. We'll go for a drive.","Rebecca"
"202",849639,852015,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.How are you feeling?","Rebecca"
"203",852268,855061,"You got on rather wellwith him, didn't you?","Rebecca"
"204",855812,858815,"That pro must have been teaching youother things than tennis.","Rebecca"
"205",860275,862568,"Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.","Rebecca"
"206",862903,865822,"I wonderif Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel.","Rebecca"
"207",919168,920626,"May I go now?","Rebecca"
"208",921253,924254,"For the number of lessons you've had,you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.","Rebecca"
"209",924423,926423,"But this will be your last,so make the most of it.","Rebecca"
"210",926591,929052,"The trouble is, with me laid up likethis, you haven't had enough to do.","Rebecca"
"211",929219,933096,"I'm getting rid of that nurse today. Andfrom now on, you'll stick to your job.","Rebecca"
"212",934182,935975,"Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.","Rebecca"
"213",938102,940145,"- Nurse?- Yes, Mrs. Hopper?","Rebecca"
"214",940313,943607,"Are you absolutely sure you leftthose messages for Mr. De Winter?","Rebecca"
"215",943775,946610,"- Why, yes, madame.- I simply can't believe it.","Rebecca"
"216",946861,948947,"He would most certainlyhave called me back.","Rebecca"
"217",949114,952200,"Oh, well. Poor boy, I simply hateto see him so alone.","Rebecca"
"218",959959,962876,"You know, I... I wish there could bean invention","Rebecca"
"219",963044,967130,"that bottled up the memory,like perfume, and it never faded,","Rebecca"
"220",967298,968341,"never got stale.","Rebecca"
"221",968509,971302,"Then whenever I wanted to,I could uncork the bottle","Rebecca"
"222",971470,973261,"and live the memory all over again.","Rebecca"
"223",973429,976057,"And what particular moment in youryoung life would you want to keep?","Rebecca"
"224",976225,978183,"All of them. All these last few days.","Rebecca"
"225",978476,982980,"I feel as though I'd... I'd collecteda whole shelf full of bottles.","Rebecca"
"226",984607,987067,"Sometimes, you know,those little bottles contain demons","Rebecca"
"227",987235,988653,"that have a way of popping out at you,","Rebecca"

"531",2531362,2533987,"I must say old Danverskeeps the house looking lovely.","Rebecca"
"532",2534155,2537032,"She's certainly learned that trickof arranging flowers from Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"533",2537201,2539034,"GILES: I wonder how she likes it now,","Rebecca"

"554",2587208,2589835,"I didn't mean to say anythingagainst Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"555",2590003,2592005,"Oh, there's no need for youto be frightened of her,","Rebecca"

"558",2599137,2601764,"You see, she's bound to beinsanely jealous at first","Rebecca"
"559",2601931,2604182,"and she must resent you bitterly.","Rebecca"
"560",2604351,2605559,"But why should she?","Rebecca"
"561",2605728,2607228,"Don't you know?","Rebecca"
"562",2607396,2609938,"I should have thoughtMaxim would have told you.","Rebecca"

"585",2671085,2672210,"Sketches.","Rebecca"
"586",2672378,2675338,"Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know,portrait of a lampshade upside down","Rebecca"

"629",2798420,2800170,"that I was quite differentfrom what she expected.","Rebecca"
"630",2800338,2801380,"What the devil did she expect?","Rebecca"

"664",2957704,2960998,"You won't tell anyoneyou saw me in there, will you?","Rebecca"
"665",2961166,2962958,"Don't you belong on the estate?","Rebecca"
"666",2963126,2964835,"I weren't doing nothing.","Rebecca"
"667",2965003,2967463,"I was just putting me shells away.","Rebecca"
"668",2967630,2970048,"She's gone in the sea, ain't she?","Rebecca"
"669",2970717,2973052,"She'll never come back no more.","Rebecca"
"670",2973804,2975972,"No. She'll never come back.","Rebecca"
"671",2977349,2978974,"Come on, Jasper.","Rebecca"
"672",2997827,3000204,"Maxim! What's the matter?","Rebecca"
"673",3000621,3001789,"Maxim!","Rebecca"
"674",3004960,3007420,"I'm sorry I was such a time,but I had to find a rope for Jasper.","Rebecca"
"675",3007586,3009422,"Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.","Rebecca"
"676",3009588,3012842,"Please wait for me. Maxim, what is it?You look so angry.","Rebecca"
"677",3013010,3015219,"You knew I didn't want you to go there,but you deliberately went.","Rebecca"
"678",3015387,3018389,"Why not? There was only a cottagedown there and a strange man who...","Rebecca"
"679",3018556,3020849,"- You didn't go in the cottage, did you?- Yes, the door was...","Rebecca"
"680",3021018,3022476,"- Don't go there again, do you hear?- Well, why not?","Rebecca"
"681",3022643,3024061,"Because I hate the place.And if you had my memories,","Rebecca"
"682",3024228,3026021,"you wouldn't go there or talk about itor even think about it.","Rebecca"
"683",3026188,3028315,"What's the matter?Oh, I'm sorry, please.","Rebecca"
"684",3029192,3030900,"We should have stayed away.","Rebecca"
"685",3031485,3034405,"We should never have come backto Manderley.","Rebecca"
"686",3035407,3037324,"Oh, what a fool I was.","Rebecca"
"687",3039494,3042329,"I've made you unhappy.Somehow, I've hurt you.","Rebecca"
"688",3042831,3045166,"Oh, I can't bear to see you like this","Rebecca"
"689",3045708,3047835,"because I love you so much.","Rebecca"
"690",3049503,3053882,"Do you?","Rebecca"
"691",3055885,3057762,"I've made you cry.","Rebecca"
"692",3058221,3059554,"Forgive me.","Rebecca"
"693",3062934,3066311,"I sometimes seem to fly off the handlefor no reason at all.","Rebecca"
"694",3068940,3070190,"Don't I?","Rebecca"
"695",3071735,3075987,"Come, we'll go home and have some teaand forget all about it.","Rebecca"
"696",3076155,3078490,"Yes, let's forget all about it.","Rebecca"
"697",3078949,3080992,"Here, let me have Jasper.","Rebecca"
"698",3110398,3113233,"- Hello. Come in.- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.","Rebecca"
"699",3113400,3115777,"I was just wonderingif you meant what you said the other day","Rebecca"
"700",3115945,3119072,"- about showing me the run of things.- Of course I did.","Rebecca"
"701",3119615,3120865,"What are you doing now?","Rebecca"
"702",3121034,3121951,"Notifying all the tenants","Rebecca"
"703",3122119,3124911,"that in celebration of Maxim's returnwith his bride,","Rebecca"
"704",3125079,3126371,"this week's rent will be free.","Rebecca"
"705",3126539,3127498,"Oh, is that Maxim's idea?","Rebecca"
"706",3127666,3130291,"Oh, yes, all the servants getan extra week's wages, too.","Rebecca"
"707",3130460,3132128,"Oh, he didn't tell me.","Rebecca"
"708",3132963,3135630,"Can't I help you?I could at least lick the stamps.","Rebecca"
"709",3135798,3138592,"Well, that's terribly nice of you.Won't you sit down?","Rebecca"
"710",3138760,3140302,"Yes, thank you.","Rebecca"
"711",3145809,3148893,"I was down at the cottage on the beachthe other day.","Rebecca"
"712",3149271,3151813,"There was a man there,a queer sort of person.","Rebecca"
"713",3151981,3153481,"Jasper kept barking at him.","Rebecca"
"714",3153650,3155483,"Oh, yes, it must have been Ben.","Rebecca"
"715",3155652,3157695,"Excuse me. He's quite harmless.","Rebecca"
"716",3157862,3160072,"We give him odd jobs now and then.","Rebecca"
"717",3160489,3163159,"That cottage bayseemed to be going to rack and ruin.","Rebecca"
"718",3163326,3165452,"Why isn't something done about it?","Rebecca"
"719",3165619,3169248,"I think if Maxim wanted anythingdone about it, he'd tell me.","Rebecca"
"720",3170583,3173501,"Are those all Rebecca's thingsdown there?","Rebecca"
"721",3174545,3175628,"Yes.","Rebecca"
"722",3176338,3177840,"Yes, they are.","Rebecca"
"723",3178842,3181010,"What did she use the cottage for?","Rebecca"
"724",3181177,3183052,"The boat used to be moored near there.","Rebecca"
"725",3183221,3185139,"What boat? What happened to it?","Rebecca"
"726",3185306,3188309,"Was that the boat she was sailing inwhen she was drowned?","Rebecca"
"727",3190228,3194565,"Yes. It capsized and sank.She was washed overboard.","Rebecca"
"728",3194733,3197233,"Wasn't she afraid to go outlike that alone?","Rebecca"
"729",3198320,3200612,"She wasn't afraid of anything.","Rebecca"
"730",3203699,3205701,"Where did they find her?","Rebecca"
"731",3207913,3209163,"Near Edgecombe,","Rebecca"
"732",3209331,3212123,"about 40 miles up channelabout two months afterwards.","Rebecca"
"733",3212791,3215085,"Maxim went up to identify her.","Rebecca"
"734",3215795,3217713,"It was horrible for him.","Rebecca"
"735",3218047,3219923,"Yes, it must have been.","Rebecca"
"736",3223802,3227722,"Mr. Crawley, please don't think memorbidly curious. It isn't that. It's...","Rebecca"
"737",3227891,3230684,"It's just that I feelat such a disadvantage.","Rebecca"
"738",3230893,3234688,"All the time, whenever I meet anyone,Maxim's sister or even the servants,","Rebecca"
"739",3234856,3236565,"I know they're all thinkingthe same thing,","Rebecca"
"740",3236733,3240277,"that they're all comparing me with her,with Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"741",3240445,3242237,"You mustn't think that.","Rebecca"
"742",3242405,3244864,"I can't tell you how glad I amthat you married Maxim.","Rebecca"
"743",3245032,3247242,"It's going to makeall the difference to his life.","Rebecca"
"744",3247409,3249744,"From my point of view,it's very refreshing","Rebecca"
"745",3249913,3251454,"to find someone like yourself,","Rebecca"
"746",3251623,3254916,"who's not entirely in tune,shall we say, with Manderley.","Rebecca"
"747",3255626,3257585,"That's very sweet of you.","Rebecca"
"748",3257920,3260422,"I daresay I've been stupid,","Rebecca"
"749",3260715,3265094,"but every day I realizethe things she had that I lack.","Rebecca"
"750",3265594,3268389,"Beauty and wit and intelligence,","Rebecca"
"751",3268556,3271724,"and all the thingsthat are so important in a woman.","Rebecca"
"752",3271893,3274519,"You have qualitiesthat are just as important,","Rebecca"
"753",3274688,3276605,"more important, if I may say so.","Rebecca"
"754",3277106,3279775,"Kindliness and sincerity,","Rebecca"
"755",3280150,3282485,"and if you'll forgive me, modesty,","Rebecca"
"756",3282653,3286282,"mean more to a husband than allthe wit and beauty in the world.","Rebecca"
"757",3286782,3288867,"We, none of us want to live in the past,","Rebecca"
"758",3289034,3290786,"Maxim least of all.","Rebecca"
"759",3291246,3294664,"It's up to you, you know,to lead us away from it.","Rebecca"
"760",3295541,3296458,"Right.","Rebecca"
"761",3296626,3299335,"I promise you I won'tbring this up again,","Rebecca"
"762",3299628,3301797,"but before we end this conversation,","Rebecca"
"763",3301965,3304465,"would you answerjust one more question?","Rebecca"
"764",3304842,3308971,"If it's something I'm able to answer,I'll do my best.","Rebecca"
"765",3310306,3313057,"Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?","Rebecca"
"766",3322985,3324402,"I suppose...","Rebecca"
"767",3325822,3329532,"I suppose she was the mostbeautiful creature I ever saw.","Rebecca"
"768",3361983,3363358,"Good evening, Maxim.","Rebecca"
"769",3363525,3365943,"Hello. The films of the honeymoonhave arrived at last.","Rebecca"
"770",3366112,3368405,"Do we have time, do you think,before dinner?","Rebecca"
"771",3373286,3375119,"What on Earth have you done to yourself?","Rebecca"
"772",3375288,3377706,"Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dressfrom London.","Rebecca"
"773",3377873,3379041,"I hope you don't mind.","Rebecca"
"774",3379208,3383045,"Oh, no, no. Only, do you thinkthat sort of thing's right for you?","Rebecca"
"775",3383213,3386715,"- It doesn't seem your type at all.- I thought you'd like it.","Rebecca"
"776",3386882,3389510,"And what have you done to your hair?","Rebecca"
"777",3390052,3391387,"Oh, I see.","Rebecca"
"778",3391846,3393597,"Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.","Rebecca"
"779",3394431,3396349,"You look lovely, lovely.","Rebecca"
"780",3396518,3398768,"It's very nice, for a change.","Rebecca"
"781",3401648,3405067,"- Shall we see these pictures?- Yes. I'd love to see them.","Rebecca"
"782",3413701,3416202,"Look now, look at that.","Rebecca"
"783",3416371,3417621,"Wasn't it wonderful, darling?","Rebecca"
"784",3417789,3418831,"Can't we go back there someday?","Rebecca"
"785",3418998,3421208,"Yes, of course. Of course.Look at you.","Rebecca"
"786",3421376,3424836,"Won't our grandchildren be delightedwhen they see how lovely you were?","Rebecca"
"787",3425003,3426088,"Oh, look at you.","Rebecca"
"788",3428925,3430259,"Oh, I like that.","Rebecca"
"789",3431219,3432219,"Look at that.","Rebecca"
"790",3432719,3433929,"Yes, very nice.","Rebecca"
"791",3434431,3435722,"- Remember that?-  Yes.","Rebecca"
"792",3435889,3438141,"I wish our honeymoon could havelasted forever, Maxim.","Rebecca"
"793",3438309,3440059,"Dash it, look.","Rebecca"
"794",3441438,3442771,"Hang it.","Rebecca"
"795",3443273,3445773,"I've threaded it up wrong as usualor something.","Rebecca"
"796",3449445,3450403,"Yes, Frith. What is it?","Rebecca"
"797",3450572,3452780,"Excuse me, sir.May I have a word with you?","Rebecca"
"798",3454284,3456452,"Yes. Come in.","Rebecca"
"799",3456619,3458619,"It's about Robert, sir.","Rebecca"
"800",3459121,3461248,"There's been a slight unpleasantnessbetween him and Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"801",3461416,3462373,"Oh, dear.","Rebecca"
"802",3462541,3464751,"- Robert is very upset.- This is trouble.","Rebecca"
"803",3464918,3465878,"What is it?","Rebecca"
"804",3466045,3469338,"It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accusedRobert of stealing a valuable ornament","Rebecca"
"805",3469507,3470465,"from the morning room.","Rebecca"
"806",3470632,3473677,"Robert denies the accusationmost emphatically, sir.","Rebecca"
"807",3475304,3477806,"- What was the thing, anyway?- China cupid, sir.","Rebecca"
"808",3477974,3479974,"Oh, dear.That's one of our treasures, isn't it?","Rebecca"
"809",3480351,3482728,"Well, tell Mrs. Danversto get to the bottom of it somehow.","Rebecca"
"810",3482896,3485563,"- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.- Very good, sir.","Rebecca"
"811",3485731,3488942,"Why do they come to me with thesethings? That's your job, sweetheart.","Rebecca"
"812",3489152,3492487,"Maxim, I wanted to tell you,but I forgot.","Rebecca"
"813",3494574,3497326,"The fact is, I broke the china cupid.","Rebecca"
"814",3497494,3498409,"You broke it?","Rebecca"
"815",3498577,3501663,"Now, why on Earth didn't you saysomething about it when Frith was here?","Rebecca"
"816",3501831,3503831,"I don't know. I didn't like to.","Rebecca"
"817",3504000,3505751,"I was afraid he'd think me a fool.","Rebecca"
"818",3505918,3507503,"He'll think you much moreof a fool now.","Rebecca"
"819",3507670,3509505,"You'll have to explain to himand Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"820",3509672,3511465,"Oh, no, Maxim.You do it. I'll go upstairs.","Rebecca"
"821",3511632,3512840,"Don't be such a little idiot, darling.","Rebecca"
"822",3513009,3515344,"Anybody would thinkyou were afraid of them.","Rebecca"
"823",3516721,3517721,"It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"824",3517889,3519347,"Apparently, Mrs. De Winterbroke the cupid herself","Rebecca"
"825",3519516,3522016,"and forgot to say anything about it.","Rebecca"
"826",3522184,3526396,"I'm so sorry. I never thoughtthat I'd get Robert into trouble.","Rebecca"
"827",3526563,3528898,"Is it possible to repairthe ornament, madam?","Rebecca"
"828",3529317,3532235,"No, I'm afraid it isn't.It smashed into pieces.","Rebecca"
"829",3533028,3535447,"What did you do with the pieces?","Rebecca"
"830",3536574,3540369,"Well, I put them at the back of oneof the drawers in the writing desk.","Rebecca"
"831",3540536,3542496,"Well, it looks as thoughMrs. De Winter was afraid","Rebecca"
"832",3542664,3544914,"you were going to put her in prison,doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?","Rebecca"
"833",3545083,3547208,"Well, never mind.Do what you can to find the pieces.","Rebecca"
"834",3547376,3550628,"See if they can be mended, andabove all, tell Robert to dry his tears.","Rebecca"
"835",3550797,3554257,"I shall apologize to Robert, of course.Perhaps if such a thing happens again,","Rebecca"
"836",3554425,3556009,"Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally.","Rebecca"
"837",3556177,3557969,"Yes, yes, all right.Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"838",3563601,3566311,"Well, I suppose that clipwill hold all right. I don't know.","Rebecca"
"839",3571733,3575195,"I'm awfully sorry,darling. It was very careless of me.","Rebecca"
"840",3575697,3578364,"- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.- Hang Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"841",3578532,3580659,"Why on Earthshould you be frightened of her?","Rebecca"
"842",3580827,3583202,"You behave more like an upstairs maidor something,","Rebecca"
"843",3583371,3586581,"- not the mistress of the house at all.- Yes, I know I do.","Rebecca"
"844",3587166,3589208,"But I feel so uncomfortable.","Rebecca"
"845",3589376,3593338,"I try my best every day, but it's verydifficult with people looking me","Rebecca"
"846",3593505,3596507,"up and down as if I were a prize cow.","Rebecca"
"847",3596675,3598302,"What does it matter if they do?You must remember","Rebecca"
"848",3598469,3602472,"that life at Manderley is the only thingthat interests anybody down here.","Rebecca"
"849",3602639,3605434,"What a slap in the eyeI must have been to them, then.","Rebecca"
"850",3605851,3607893,"I suppose that's why you married me,","Rebecca"
"851",3608061,3611565,"because you knew I was dull and gaucheand inexperienced,","Rebecca"
"852",3611733,3614192,"and there'd never beany gossip about me.","Rebecca"
"853",3614360,3617278,"Gossip? What do you mean?","Rebecca"
"854",3617905,3620907,"I don't know.I just said it for something to say.","Rebecca"
"855",3621074,3623702,"Don't look at me like that. Maxim.","Rebecca"
"856",3624829,3627371,"What's the matter? What have I said?","Rebecca"
"857",3633713,3635922,"Wasn't a very attractive thingto say, was it?","Rebecca"
"858",3636090,3639675,"No. It was rude, hateful.","Rebecca"
"859",3644974,3647934,"I wonder if I did a very selfish thingin marrying you.","Rebecca"
"860",3648101,3649644,"How do you mean?","Rebecca"
"861",3649811,3652313,"I'm not much of a companionto you, am I?","Rebecca"
"862",3653483,3655817,"You don't get much fun, do you?","Rebecca"
"863",3656652,3660030,"You ought to have married a boy,someone of your own age.","Rebecca"
"864",3660280,3663492,"Maxim, why do you say this?Of course we're companions.","Rebecca"
"865",3663867,3667204,"Are we? I don't know.","Rebecca"
"866",3668664,3670706,"- I'm very difficult to live with.- No, you're not difficult.","Rebecca"
"867",3670875,3672333,"You're easy, very easy.","Rebecca"
"868",3673043,3676253,"Our marriage is a success,isn't it, a great success?","Rebecca"
"869",3676422,3679173,"We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?","Rebecca"
"870",3687349,3689726,"If you don't think we are happy,","Rebecca"
"871",3690353,3693438,"it would be much betterif you didn't pretend.","Rebecca"
"872",3694273,3695731,"I'll go away.","Rebecca"
"873",3699237,3701195,"Why don't you answer me?","Rebecca"
"874",3703532,3705282,"How can I answer you","Rebecca"
"875",3705909,3708536,"when I don't know the answer myself?","Rebecca"
"876",3710164,3713333,"If you say we're happy,let's leave it at that.","Rebecca"
"877",3713835,3716836,"Happiness is somethingI know nothing about.","Rebecca"
"878",3722260,3725721,"Oh, look. There's the onewhen I left the camera","Rebecca"
"879",3725887,3728222,"running on the tripod, remember?","Rebecca"
"880",3780777,3783695,"Pardon me, madam.Is there anything I can do for you?","Rebecca"

"1096",4946899,4950069,"She was beaten in the end,but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.","Rebecca"
"1097",4950235,4951278,"It was the sea.","Rebecca"
"1098",4951445,4954405,"Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh, stop it.","Rebecca"
"1099",4974344,4977887,"You're overwrought, madam.I've opened a window for you.","Rebecca"

"1124",5120030,5121198,"No, he hasn't been in the house at all,","Rebecca"

"1127",5128331,5130707,"- There is something wrong.- Well...","Rebecca"

"1160",5288949,5290533,"Rebecca has won.","Rebecca"
"1161",5294247,5298542,"Her shadow has been between us allthe time, keeping us from one another.","Rebecca"
"1162",5300502,5302796,"She knew that this would happen.","Rebecca"
"1163",5303506,5305298,"What are you saying?","Rebecca"
"1164",5306634,5308635,"They sent a diver down.","Rebecca"

"1166",5312222,5316475,"Rebecca's boat. Oh, it'sterrible for you. I'm so sorry.","Rebecca"
"1167",5317353,5319854,"The diver made another discovery.","Rebecca"
"1168",5320105,5322606,"Broke one of the portsand looked into the cabin.","Rebecca"
"1169",5324484,5325985,"There was a body in there.","Rebecca"
"1170",5327195,5330198,"She wasn't alone.There was someone sailing with her,","Rebecca"
"1171",5330365,5333493,"and you have to find out who it was,that's it, isn't it, Maxim?","Rebecca"
"1172",5333661,5337663,"You don't understand.There was no one with her.","Rebecca"
"1173",5339250,5342502,"It's Rebecca's body lying thereon the cabin floor.","Rebecca"
"1174",5343837,5345005,"Oh, no.","Rebecca"
"1175",5346173,5348425,"The woman that was washed upat Edgecombe,","Rebecca"
"1176",5349260,5351720,"the woman that is now buriedin the family crypt,","Rebecca"
"1177",5352846,5354680,"that was not Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1178",5355515,5358185,"That was the bodyof some unknown woman,","Rebecca"
"1179",5358353,5360811,"unclaimed, belonging nowhere.","Rebecca"
"1180",5362774,5365984,"I identified it.But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1181",5367362,5368987,"It was all a lie.","Rebecca"
"1182",5370864,5373324,"I knew where Rebecca's body was,","Rebecca"
"1183",5374702,5377578,"lying on that cabin flooron the bottom of the sea.","Rebecca"
"1184",5378038,5380039,"How did you know, Maxim?","Rebecca"
"1185",5380666,5383877,"Because I put it there.","Rebecca"
"1186",5392386,5396139,"Will you look into my eyesand tell me that you love me now?","Rebecca"
"1187",5408694,5411445,"You see? I was right.","Rebecca"
"1188",5413824,5415283,"It's too late.","Rebecca"
"1189",5421748,5424876,"No, it's not too late.You're not to say that.","Rebecca"
"1190",5425043,5427253,"I love you more than anythingin the world.","Rebecca"
"1191",5427505,5430423,"- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.- No.","Rebecca"
"1192",5431300,5433926,"It's no use. It's too late.","Rebecca"
"1193",5434095,5437639,"Oh, we can't lose each other now.We must be together always.","Rebecca"
"1194",5437806,5439140,"No secrets, no shadows.","Rebecca"
"1195",5439307,5442269,"We may only have a few days,a few hours.","Rebecca"
"1196",5442436,5444354,"Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?","Rebecca"
"1197",5444521,5447356,"I nearly did sometimes,but you never seemed close enough.","Rebecca"
"1198",5447524,5450902,"How could we be close when I knewyou were always thinking of Rebecca?","Rebecca"
"1199",5451779,5455739,"How could I even ask you to love me,when I knew you loved Rebecca still?","Rebecca"
"1200",5457076,5459202,"What are you talking about?","Rebecca"
"1201",5460246,5461872,"What do you mean?","Rebecca"
"1202",5463082,5466542,"Whenever you touched me, I knewyou were comparing me with Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1203",5468003,5472381,"Whenever you looked at me or spoketo me or walked with me in the garden,","Rebecca"
"1204",5472800,5477136,"I knew you were thinking, ""This I didwith Rebecca, and this, and this.""","Rebecca"
"1205",5477721,5479096,"Oh, it's true, isn't it?","Rebecca"
"1206",5479306,5482684,"You thought I loved Rebecca?You thought that?","Rebecca"
"1207",5486146,5487689,"I hated her.","Rebecca"
"1208",5500161,5504622,"Oh, I was carried away by her,enchanted by her as everyone was.","Rebecca"
"1209",5505875,5510002,"And when I was married, I was toldI was the luckiest man in the world.","Rebecca"
"1210",5513131,5516551,"She was so lovely, so accomplished,","Rebecca"
"1211",5517302,5518677,"so amusing.","Rebecca"
"1212",5519639,5523140,"""She's got the three things that reallymatter in a wife,"" everyone said.","Rebecca"
"1213",5523350,5525685,"""Breeding, brains and beauty.""","Rebecca"
"1214",5526020,5528604,"And I believed them. Completely.","Rebecca"
"1215",5530358,5533400,"But I never hada moment's happiness with her.","Rebecca"
"1216",5533653,5535654,"She was incapable of love","Rebecca"
"1217",5536029,5537572,"or tenderness","Rebecca"
"1218",5538448,5539823,"or decency.","Rebecca"
"1219",5540952,5543453,"You didn't love her.You didn't love her.","Rebecca"
"1220",5544956,5548332,"Do you remember that cliffwhere you first saw me in Monte Carlo?","Rebecca"
"1221",5549918,5552503,"Well, I went there with Rebeccaon our honeymoon.","Rebecca"
"1222",5553005,5556716,"That's where I found out about her,four days after we were married.","Rebecca"
"1223",5558636,5562555,"She stood there laughing,her black hair blowing in the wind","Rebecca"
"1224",5563932,5567810,"and told me all about herself.Everything.","Rebecca"
"1225",5570564,5573149,"Things I'll never tell a living soul.","Rebecca"
"1226",5574193,5575985,"I wanted to kill her.","Rebecca"
"1227",5576279,5578738,"It would have been so easy.You remember the precipice?","Rebecca"
"1228",5581117,5584743,"I frightened you, didn't I?You thought I was mad.","Rebecca"
"1229",5585621,5588707,"Perhaps I was. Perhaps I am mad.","Rebecca"
"1230",5590083,5593043,"It wouldn't make for sanity, would it?Living with the devil?","Rebecca"
"1231",5596591,5598800,"""I'll make a bargain with you,""she said.","Rebecca"
"1232",5598967,5601302,"""You'd look rather foolishtrying to divorce me now","Rebecca"
"1233",5601470,5602845,"after four days of marriage,","Rebecca"
"1234",5603014,5604639,"so I'll play the partof a devoted wife,","Rebecca"
"1235",5604806,5606349,"mistress of your precious Manderley.","Rebecca"
"1236",5606516,5609560,"I'll make it the most famous showplacein England, if you like,","Rebecca"
"1237",5609729,5611354,"and people will visit us and envy us,","Rebecca"
"1238",5611521,5614608,"and say we're the luckiest,happiest couple in the country.","Rebecca"
"1239",5616985,5619779,"What a grand joke it'll be.What a triumph.""","Rebecca"
"1240",5624868,5628747,"I should never have acceptedher dirty bargain, but I did.","Rebecca"
"1241",5630457,5634586,"I was younger then, and tremendouslyconscious of the family honor.","Rebecca"
"1242",5636421,5637881,"Family honor.","Rebecca"
"1243",5639007,5641967,"She knew that I'd sacrifice everythingrather than stand up in a divorce court","Rebecca"
"1244",5642136,5645055,"and give her away, admit thatour marriage was a rotten fraud.","Rebecca"
"1245",5647975,5649809,"You despise me, don't you?","Rebecca"
"1246",5650603,5651645,"As I despise myself.","Rebecca"
"1247",5651811,5654689,"You can't understandwhat my feelings were,","Rebecca"
"1248",5655983,5656983,"can you?","Rebecca"
"1249",5658319,5660737,"Of course I can, darling.Of course I can.","Rebecca"
"1250",5663823,5667327,"Well, I kept the bargainand so did she, apparently.","Rebecca"
"1251",5667494,5669912,"Oh, she played the game brilliantly,","Rebecca"
"1252",5670163,5672582,"but after a while,she began to grow careless.","Rebecca"
"1253",5672832,5676002,"She took a flat in London,and she'd stay away for days at a time.","Rebecca"
"1254",5676337,5678837,"Then she startedto bring her friends down here.","Rebecca"
"1255",5679172,5680881,"I warned her,but she shrugged her shoulders.","Rebecca"
"1256",5681050,5683259,"""What's it got to do with you?""She said.","Rebecca"
"1257",5683844,5685761,"She even started on Frank.","Rebecca"
"1258",5686346,5687971,"Poor, faithful Frank.","Rebecca"
"1259",5688890,5692685,"Then there was a cousin of hers,a man named Favell.","Rebecca"
"1260",5693145,5695854,"Yes. I know him.He came the day you went to London.","Rebecca"
"1261",5697315,5698858,"Why didn't you tell me?","Rebecca"
"1262",5699025,5700694,"I didn't like to.","Rebecca"
"1263",5701278,5703779,"I thought it wouldremind you of Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1264",5704573,5705907,"Remind me?","Rebecca"
"1265",5707784,5709786,"As if I needed reminding.","Rebecca"
"1266",5711372,5714039,"Favell used to visit her herein this cottage.","Rebecca"
"1267",5714375,5716626,"I found out about it, and I warned herthat if he came here again,","Rebecca"
"1268",5716793,5718252,"I'd shoot them both.","Rebecca"
"1269",5720256,5723800,"One night, when I found she hadcome back quietly from London,","Rebecca"
"1270",5724051,5726219,"I thought that Favell was with her,","Rebecca"
"1271",5726429,5728762,"and I knew thenthat I couldn't stand","Rebecca"
"1272",5728930,5732141,"this life of filth and deceitany longer.","Rebecca"
"1273",5732350,5736145,"I decided to come down hereand have it out with both of them.","Rebecca"
"1274",5738774,5740274,"But she was alone.","Rebecca"
"1275",5740443,5743528,"She was expecting Favell,but he hadn't come.","Rebecca"
"1276",5744195,5748115,"She was lying on the divan, a largetray of cigarette stubs beside her.","Rebecca"
"1277",5749909,5751786,"She looked ill, queer.","Rebecca"
"1278",5752579,5755998,"Suddenly, she got up,started to walk toward me.","Rebecca"
"1279",5758002,5760753,"""When I have a child,"" she said,""neither you nor anyone else","Rebecca"
"1280",5760921,5762881,"could ever prove it wasn't yours.","Rebecca"
"1281",5763631,5764923,"You would like to have an heir,wouldn't you, Max,","Rebecca"
"1282",5765091,5766801,"for your precious Manderley?""","Rebecca"
"1283",5767511,5769011,"Then she started to laugh.","Rebecca"
"1284",5769596,5772556,"""How funny.How supremely, wonderfully funny.","Rebecca"
"1285",5773057,5776185,"I'll be the perfect mother,just as I've been the perfect wife.","Rebecca"
"1286",5776353,5778104,"No one will ever know.","Rebecca"
"1287",5778396,5780523,"It ought to give youthe thrill of your life, Max,","Rebecca"
"1288",5780690,5783400,"to watch my son grow bigger day by day","Rebecca"
"1289",5783569,5786529,"and to know that when you die,Manderley will be his.""","Rebecca"
"1290",5788615,5790867,"She was face to face with me.","Rebecca"
"1291",5791284,5794871,"One hand in her pocket,the other holding a cigarette.","Rebecca"
"1292",5796289,5797873,"She was smiling.","Rebecca"
"1293",5798917,5800292,"""Well, Max?","Rebecca"
"1294",5800752,5803296,"What are you going to do about it?","Rebecca"
"1295",5804256,5806466,"Aren't you going to kill me?""","Rebecca"
"1296",5808969,5811470,"I suppose I went mad for a moment.","Rebecca"
"1297",5812680,5814599,"I must have struck her.","Rebecca"
"1298",5818729,5820688,"She stood staring at me.","Rebecca"
"1299",5822315,5824525,"She looked almost triumphant.","Rebecca"
"1300",5826194,5829697,"Then she started toward me again.Smiling.","Rebecca"
"1301",5830908,5833326,"Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.","Rebecca"
"1302",5838791,5840041,"When I looked down,","Rebecca"
"1303",5840208,5843127,"ages afterwards, it seemed,she was lying on the floor.","Rebecca"
"1304",5843295,5847673,"She had struck her headon a heavy piece of ship's tackle.","Rebecca"
"1305",5850176,5853262,"I remember wonderingwhy she was still smiling.","Rebecca"
"1306",5854849,5856515,"Then I realized she was dead.","Rebecca"
"1307",5856684,5859685,"But you didn't kill her.It was an accident.","Rebecca"
"1308",5860270,5862063,"Who would believe me?","Rebecca"
"1309",5862773,5864314,"I lost my head.","Rebecca"
"1310",5864692,5867694,"I just knew I had to do something.Anything.","Rebecca"
"1311",5868863,5871197,"I carried her out to the boat.","Rebecca"
"1312",5871865,5874449,"It was very dark. There was no moon.","Rebecca"
"1313",5875536,5876953,"I put her in the cabin.","Rebecca"
"1314",5877872,5880163,"When the boat seemed a safe distancefrom the shore, I took a spike,","Rebecca"
"1315",5880332,5883208,"and drove it again and againthrough the planking of the hull.","Rebecca"
"1316",5883377,5886378,"I had opened up the seacocksand the water began to come in fast.","Rebecca"
"1317",5886838,5889215,"I climbed over into the dinghyand pulled away.","Rebecca"
"1318",5890466,5892594,"I saw the boat heel over","Rebecca"
"1319",5894012,5895262,"and sink.","Rebecca"
"1320",5897056,5899225,"I pulled back into the cove.","Rebecca"
"1321",5900895,5902604,"It started raining.","Rebecca"
"1322",5903021,5907649,"- Maxim, does anyone else know of this?- No. No one except you and me.","Rebecca"
"1323",5909987,5911738,"We must explain it.","Rebecca"
"1324",5912113,5915073,"It's got to be the body of someoneyou've never seen before.","Rebecca"
"1325",5915242,5919244,"No, they're bound to know her.Her rings, bracelets she always wore.","Rebecca"
"1326",5920247,5924417,"They'll identify her body,then they'll remember the other woman.","Rebecca"
"1327",5925752,5928337,"The other woman buried in the crypt.","Rebecca"
"1328",5928881,5930672,"If they find out it was Rebecca,","Rebecca"
"1329",5930841,5933592,"you must simply say you made a mistakeabout the other body.","Rebecca"
"1330",5933886,5935302,"That the day you went to Edgecombe,you were ill,","Rebecca"
"1331",5935470,5936930,"you didn't know what you were doing.","Rebecca"
"1332",5937096,5939599,"Rebecca's dead. That's whatwe've got to remember. Rebecca's dead.","Rebecca"
"1333",5939766,5943435,"She can't speak. She can't bear witness.She can't harm you anymore.","Rebecca"
"1334",5943604,5946521,"We're the only two people in the worldthat know, Maxim, you and I.","Rebecca"
"1335",5946689,5949775,"I'd told you once that I'd donea selfish thing in marrying you.","Rebecca"
"1336",5950735,5953320,"You can understand now what I meant.","Rebecca"
"1337",5954030,5956114,"I've loved you, my darling.","Rebecca"
"1338",5956699,5958701,"I shall always love you,","Rebecca"
"1339",5959243,5960953,"but I've known all along","Rebecca"
"1340",5961622,5963622,"that Rebecca would win in the end.","Rebecca"
"1341",5963791,5965958,"No, no. She hasn't won.","Rebecca"
"1342",5966292,5969087,"No matter what happens now,she hasn't won.","Rebecca"
"1343",5983435,5984810,"Hello?","Rebecca"
"1344",5987230,5988689,"Hello, Frank.","Rebecca"
"1345",5988983,5990399,"Hello, Frank. Yes.","Rebecca"
"1346",5990650,5992402,"Who? Colonel Julyan?","Rebecca"
"1347",5994029,5997614,"Yes. Tell him I'll meet him thereas soon as I possibly can.","Rebecca"
"1348",5997949,5999033,"What?","Rebecca"
"1349",6001161,6002161,"Well...","Rebecca"
"1350",6002829,6006457,"Say we could talk about thatwhen we're sure about the matter.","Rebecca"
"1351",6009962,6011671,"What's happened?","Rebecca"
"1352",6012840,6014673,"Colonel Julyan called.","Rebecca"
"1353",6015134,6017510,"He's the chief constable of the county.","Rebecca"
"1354",6017677,6020387,"He's been asked by the policeto go to the mortuary.","Rebecca"
"1355",6021055,6024141,"He wanted to know if I could possiblyhave made a mistake","Rebecca"
"1356",6025185,6026685,"about that other body.","Rebecca"
"1357",6047207,6051252,"Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I didmake a mistake about that other body.","Rebecca"
"1358",6051420,6053462,"The mistake was naturalunder the circumstances.","Rebecca"
"1359",6053630,6057382,"- Besides, you weren't well at the time.- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.","Rebecca"
"1360",6057717,6061595,"Don't let it worry you, Maxim. Nobodycan blame you for making a mistake.","Rebecca"
"1361",6062722,6065807,"The pity is, you've got to go throughthe same thing all over again.","Rebecca"
"1362",6065975,6067225,"What do you mean?","Rebecca"
"1363",6067394,6071146,"There'll have to be another inquest,of course. Same formality and red tape.","Rebecca"
"1364",6072065,6075484,"Wish you could be spared the publicityof it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.","Rebecca"
"1365",6075652,6077819,"Oh, yes, publicity.","Rebecca"
"1366",6078238,6082492,"I suppose Mrs. De Winter went belowfor something and a squall hit the boat","Rebecca"
"1367",6082868,6084577,"with nobody at the helm.","Rebecca"
"1368",6084744,6087121,"I imagine that's about the solution now,don't you think so, Crawley?","Rebecca"
"1369",6087288,6089916,"Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed,and she couldn't get on deck again.","Rebecca"
"1370",6090083,6091042,"Yeah.","Rebecca"
"1371",6091210,6095087,"Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedlycome to some such conclusion.","Rebecca"
"1372",6095255,6097465,"Why, what would he know about it?","Rebecca"
"1373",6097966,6101844,"Well, he's examining the boat now.Purely as a matter of routine, you know.","Rebecca"
"1374",6102386,6105847,"I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim,quite unofficially, you know.","Rebecca"
"1375",6106140,6108975,"We must get together for a gameof golf when it's all over, eh?","Rebecca"
"1376",6109144,6110144,"Bye-bye.","Rebecca"
"1377",6123908,6126327,"I have the evening papers, madam.Would you care to see them?","Rebecca"
"1378",6126494,6127494,"Oh, no thank you, Frith,","Rebecca"
"1379",6127662,6130206,"and I prefer that Mr. De Winterweren't troubled with them, either.","Rebecca"
"1380",6130373,6133960,"I understand, madam. Permit me to saythat we're all most distressed outside.","Rebecca"
"1381",6134127,6135293,"Thank you, Frith.","Rebecca"
"1382",6135462,6138463,"I'm afraid the news has beena great shock to Mrs. Danvers.","Rebecca"
"1383",6138631,6140507,"Yes, I rather expected it would be.","Rebecca"
"1384",6140676,6143594,"It seems there's to bea coroner's inquest, madam?","Rebecca"
"1385",6143761,6146221,"Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.","Rebecca"
"1386",6146390,6148015,"Of course, madam. I...","Rebecca"
"1387",6148182,6151560,"I wanted to say that if any of usmight be required to give evidence,","Rebecca"
"1388",6151728,6154896,"I should be only too pleased to doanything that might help the family.","Rebecca"
"1389",6155064,6156649,"Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I...","Rebecca"
"1390",6156817,6159402,"I'm sure Mr. De Winterwill be very happy to hear it.","Rebecca"
"1391",6159819,6162320,"But I don't thinkanything will be necessary.","Rebecca"
"1392",6175377,6176543,"Maxim.","Rebecca"
"1393",6178755,6180297,"Hello, darling.","Rebecca"
"1394",6181591,6184676,"Oh, Maxim, I'm worried aboutwhat you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.","Rebecca"
"1395",6185095,6186720,"What do you mean?","Rebecca"
"1396",6187471,6189055,"You won't lose your temper, will you?","Rebecca"
"1397",6189224,6191934,"Promise methat they won't make you angry.","Rebecca"
"1398",6192101,6194854,"All right, darling. I promise.","Rebecca"
"1399",6195021,6198481,"No matter what he asks you,you won't lose your head?","Rebecca"
"1400",6198734,6200400,"Don't worry, dear.","Rebecca"
"1401",6201069,6203195,"They can't do anything at once,can they?","Rebecca"
"1402",6203363,6205072,"No.","Rebecca"
"1403",6205740,6207490,"Then we've a little time leftto be together.","Rebecca"
"1404",6207658,6208826,"Yes.","Rebecca"
"1405",6210287,6214372,"- I want to go to the inquest with you.- I'd rather you didn't, darling.","Rebecca"
"1406",6214707,6216833,"But I can't wait here alone.","Rebecca"
"1407",6217002,6219795,"I promise you,I won't be any trouble to you.","Rebecca"
"1408",6220881,6223048,"And I must be near youso that no matter what happens,","Rebecca"
"1409",6223216,6226092,"we won't be separated for a moment.","Rebecca"
"1410",6227220,6228845,"All right, dear.","Rebecca"
"1411",6230724,6233809,"I don't mind this whole thingexcept for you.","Rebecca"
"1412",6234435,6237063,"I can't forget what it's done to you.","Rebecca"
"1413",6237564,6240983,"I've been thinking of nothing elsesince it happened.","Rebecca"
"1414",6244529,6246238,"It's gone forever,","Rebecca"
"1415",6247073,6250993,"that funny, young, lost look I loved.","Rebecca"
"1416",6252203,6254204,"It won't ever come back.","Rebecca"
"1417",6255082,6258167,"I killed thatwhen I told you about Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1418",6258961,6260293,"It's gone.","Rebecca"
"1419",6261296,6265675,"In a few hours,you've grown so much older.","Rebecca"
"1420",6268136,6270095,"Oh, Maxim, Maxim.","Rebecca"
"1421",6296456,6298373,"Black Jack Brady was his name.","Rebecca"
"1422",6298542,6301167,"The most important arrest I ever made.","Rebecca"
"1423",6301336,6303337,"It must have beenabout two years ago now.","Rebecca"
"1424",6303505,6306756,"Of course, there was no doubt about it.He was hung a month after I caught him.","Rebecca"
"1425",6307175,6308801,"Hello. Wait a minute.","Rebecca"
"1426",6310177,6312637,"They've got old Balmy Ben up now.","Rebecca"
"1427",6313472,6315307,"You rememberthe late Mrs. De Winter, don't you?","Rebecca"
"1428",6315475,6317560,"- She's gone.- Yes, we know that.","Rebecca"
"1429",6318103,6321939,"- She went in the sea. The sea got her.- That's right. That's right.","Rebecca"
"1430",6322106,6324608,"Now we want you to tell uswhether you were on the shore","Rebecca"
"1431",6324775,6326860,"- that last night she went sailing.- Eh?","Rebecca"
"1432",6327320,6331657,"Were you on the shore that last nightshe went out, when she didn't come back?","Rebecca"
"1433",6332242,6336662,"I didn't see nothing.I don't want to go to the asylum.","Rebecca"
"1434",6336829,6338663,"Them cruel folks there.","Rebecca"
"1435",6338832,6340750,"Now, nobody's going to send youto the asylum.","Rebecca"
"1436",6340917,6343836,"All we want you to dois tell us what you saw.","Rebecca"
"1437",6344003,6345671,"I didn't see nothing.","Rebecca"
"1438",6345881,6346963,"Come, come.","Rebecca"
"1439",6347131,6350926,"Did you see Mrs. De Winterget into her boat that last night?","Rebecca"
"1440",6351261,6353054,"I don't know nothing.","Rebecca"
"1441",6353471,6355890,"I don't want to go to the asylum.","Rebecca"
"1442",6359019,6360519,"Very well. You may go.","Rebecca"
"1443",6360686,6362229,"- Eh?- You may go now.","Rebecca"
"1444",6364565,6366984,"- Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.- Yes?","Rebecca"
"1445",6371864,6373908,"The evidence you givewill be the truth, the whole truth","Rebecca"
"1446",6374076,6375618,"and nothing but the truth,so help you God?","Rebecca"
"1447",6375786,6378537,"I do, so help me God.","Rebecca"
"1448",6378704,6380456,"The late Mrs. De Winterused to send her boat","Rebecca"
"1449",6380623,6383376,"- to your shipyard for reconditioning.- That's right, sir.","Rebecca"
"1450",6383542,6384835,"Can you remember any occasion","Rebecca"
"1451",6385002,6386878,"when she had any sort of accidentwith the boat?","Rebecca"
"1452",6387046,6389965,"No, sir. I often saidMrs. De Winter was a born sailor.","Rebecca"
"1453",6390132,6392592,"Now, when Mrs. De Winterwent below, as is supposed,","Rebecca"
"1454",6392761,6394761,"and a sudden gust of wind came down,","Rebecca"
"1455",6394930,6397264,"that would be enough to capsizethe boat, wouldn't it?","Rebecca"
"1456",6397431,6401060,"Excuse me, sir. But there'sa little more to it than that.","Rebecca"
"1457",6401435,6404521,"- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?- I mean, sir, the seacocks.","Rebecca"
"1458",6404689,6405980,"What are the seacocks?","Rebecca"
"1459",6406149,6407149,"Sea...","Rebecca"
"1460",6408609,6411820,"The seacocks are the valvesto drain out the boat.","Rebecca"
"1461",6412405,6415740,"They're always kept tight closedwhen you're afloat.","Rebecca"
"1462",6416158,6417243,"Yes?","Rebecca"
"1463",6417743,6421329,"Well, yesterday, when I examinedthat boat, I found they'd been opened.","Rebecca"
"1464",6421539,6423207,"What could be the reason for that?","Rebecca"
"1465",6423375,6426752,"Just this, that's what flooded the boatand sunk her.","Rebecca"
"1466",6428171,6431881,"Are you implyingthat boat never capsized at all?","Rebecca"
"1467",6432259,6435845,"I know it's a terrible thing to say,sir, but in my opinion,","Rebecca"
"1468",6436011,6437011,"she was scuttled.","Rebecca"
"1469",6440641,6443601,"- And there's them holes.- What holes?","Rebecca"
"1470",6444186,6446814,"- In her planking.- What are you talking about?","Rebecca"
"1471",6447274,6450525,"Of course, that boat's been underwaterfor over a year,","Rebecca"
"1472",6450694,6453612,"and the tide's been knocking heragainst the ridge.","Rebecca"
"1473",6453779,6458367,"But it seemed to me them holes lookedas if she'd made them from the inside.","Rebecca"
"1474",6459786,6462037,"Then you believeshe must have done it deliberately.","Rebecca"
"1475",6462204,6466167,"Couldn't have been no accident,not with her knowledge of boats.","Rebecca"
"1476",6468752,6470587,"You knew the former Mrs. De Wintervery well, I believe?","Rebecca"
"1477",6470755,6471671,"Oh, yes.","Rebecca"
"1478",6471840,6473966,"Would you have believed hercapable of suicide?","Rebecca"
"1479",6474676,6478136,"No. Frankly, I would not.But you never can tell.","Rebecca"
"1480",6479305,6481515,"You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.","Rebecca"
"1481",6482516,6484393,"Mr. De Winter, please.","Rebecca"
"1482",6493487,6495695,"Sorry to drag you backfor further questioning, Mr. De Winter.","Rebecca"
"1483",6495863,6497198,"But you've heardthe statement of Mr. Tabb.","Rebecca"
"1484",6497364,6499073,"I wonder if you can help us in any way.","Rebecca"
"1485",6499242,6500201,"I'm afraid not.","Rebecca"
"1486",6500368,6501993,"Can you think of any reasonwhy there should be holes","Rebecca"
"1487",6502162,6504329,"in the plankingof the late Mrs. De Winter's boat?","Rebecca"
"1488",6504497,6506916,"Well, of courseI can't think of any reason.","Rebecca"
"1489",6507167,6509292,"Has anyone ever discussedthese holes with you before?","Rebecca"
"1490",6509461,6511295,"Well, since the boat has beenat the bottom of the ocean,","Rebecca"
"1491",6511462,6513046,"I scarcely think that likely.","Rebecca"
"1492",6514341,6516341,"Mr. De Winter, I want youto believe we all feel very deeply","Rebecca"
"1493",6516510,6517510,"for you in this matter.","Rebecca"
"1494",6517676,6519386,"But you must rememberthat I don't conduct this inquiry","Rebecca"
"1495",6519554,6520512,"for my own amusement.","Rebecca"
"1496",6520680,6522555,"- That's rather obvious, isn't it?- I hope that it is.","Rebecca"
"1497",6522724,6524265,"Well, since she went sailing alone,","Rebecca"
"1498",6524434,6526351,"are we to believethat she drove those holes herself?","Rebecca"
"1499",6526520,6528061,"You may believe what you like.","Rebecca"
"1500",6528229,6531064,"Can you enlighten us as towhy Mrs. De Winter should have wanted","Rebecca"
"1501",6531233,6532608,"to end her own life?","Rebecca"
"1502",6532775,6534234,"I know of no reason whatever.","Rebecca"
"1503",6534402,6537154,"Mr. De Winter,however painful it may be,","Rebecca"
"1504",6537322,6539030,"I have to ask youa very personal question.","Rebecca"
"1505",6539490,6548457,"Were relations between you and the lateMrs. De Winter perfectly happy?","Rebecca"
"1506",6548625,6552127,"I won't stand this any longer!You might as well know now...","Rebecca"
"1507",6553462,6554837,"We'll adjourn till after lunch.","Rebecca"
"1508",6555006,6558634,"Mr. De Winter, I presumeyou'll be available for us then?","Rebecca"
"1509",6559719,6561720,"I told you,you should have had some breakfast.","Rebecca"
"1510",6561887,6564305,"You're hungry.That's what's the matter with you.","Rebecca"
"1511",6569395,6571438,"Mr. Frith thought you mightlike to have some lunch from the house,","Rebecca"
"1512",6571605,6572605,"and sent me with it.","Rebecca"
"1513",6572774,6574399,"No, that's fine.Pull around the corner.","Rebecca"
"1514",6574568,6576234,"Very good, sir.","Rebecca"
"1515",6585744,6587496,"Awfully foolish of me,fainting like that.","Rebecca"
"1516",6587663,6590416,"Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted likethat, I'd have really lost my temper.","Rebecca"
"1517",6590583,6592333,"Darling, please be careful.","Rebecca"
"1518",6599676,6602302,"Darling, wait here a few moments.I'll see if I can find old Frank.","Rebecca"
"1519",6602470,6604220,"Of course, darling.Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.","Rebecca"
"1520",6604389,6605389,"Sure?","Rebecca"
"1521",6607809,6611145,"Here, try a spot of this. Do you good.","Rebecca"
"1522",6611313,6612645,"Thank you.","Rebecca"
"1523",6615609,6618109,"- Are you all right?- Yes, of course.","Rebecca"
"1524",6618862,6621195,"- I won't be long.- Right you are.","Rebecca"
"1525",6624492,6625658,"Hello.","Rebecca"
"1526",6626453,6629287,"And how does the bridefind herself today?","Rebecca"
"1527",6632000,6635085,"I say, marriage with Maxis not exactly a bed of roses, is it?","Rebecca"
"1528",6635252,6637128,"I think you'd better gobefore Maxim gets back.","Rebecca"
"1529",6637296,6640798,"Oh, jealous, is he?Well, I can't say I blame him.","Rebecca"
"1530",6640966,6643676,"But you don't think I'mthe big bad wolf, do you?","Rebecca"
"1531",6643845,6646721,"I'm not, you know. I'm a perfectlyordinary, harmless bloke.","Rebecca"
"1532",6647015,6651143,"And I think you're behaving splendidlyover all this. Perfectly splendidly.","Rebecca"
"1533",6652228,6655480,"You know, you've grown up a bitsince I last saw you. It's no wonder...","Rebecca"
"1534",6655649,6657231,"What do you want, Favell?","Rebecca"
"1535",6657399,6660735,"Oh, hello, Max. Things are goingpretty well for you, aren't they?","Rebecca"
"1536",6660904,6662488,"Better than you ever expected.","Rebecca"
"1537",6662655,6665490,"I was rather worried about you at first.That's why I came down to the inquest.","Rebecca"
"1538",6665658,6667033,"Well, I'm touched by your solicitude.","Rebecca"
"1539",6667202,6669828,"But if you don't mind,we'd rather like to have our lunch.","Rebecca"
"1540",6669996,6673998,"Lunch? I say, what a jolly idea.Rather like a picnic, isn't it?","Rebecca"
"1541",6674958,6677836,"I'm so sorry.Do you mind if I put this there?","Rebecca"
"1542",6678003,6681881,"You know, Max, old boy, I really thinkI ought to talk things over with you.","Rebecca"
"1543",6682050,6683926,"Talk what things over?","Rebecca"
"1544",6684386,6687512,"Well, those holes in the planking,for one thing.","Rebecca"
"1545",6687721,6690099,"Those holesthat were drilled from the inside.","Rebecca"
"1546",6690265,6691934,"- Oh, Mullen?- Yes, sir?","Rebecca"
"1547",6692769,6695270,"Would you, like a good fellow,have my car filled with petrol?","Rebecca"
"1548",6695438,6696729,"- It's almost empty.- Very good, sir.","Rebecca"
"1549",6696898,6699358,"- And, Mullen, close the door, will you?- Yes, sir.","Rebecca"
"1550",6700819,6702403,"Does this bother you?","Rebecca"
"1551",6710161,6712871,"You know, old boy, I have a strongfeeling that before the day's out,","Rebecca"
"1552",6713038,6716417,"somebody's going to make useof that rather expressive,","Rebecca"
"1553",6716583,6719712,"though somewhat old-fashioned term,""foul play.""","Rebecca"
"1554",6721381,6723590,"Am I boring you with all this?","Rebecca"
"1555",6724509,6725551,"No?","Rebecca"
"1556",6727261,6731222,"Good. Well, you see, Max, I findmyself in a rather awkward position.","Rebecca"
"1557",6731557,6735226,"You've only got to read this noteto understand. It's from Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1558",6735395,6738354,"And, what's more, she had the foresightto put a date on it.","Rebecca"
"1559",6739858,6741483,"She wrote me the day she died.","Rebecca"
"1560",6741650,6743985,"Incidentally, I was at a partyon that night","Rebecca"
"1561",6744154,6745738,"so I didn't get it until the next day.","Rebecca"
"1562",6745904,6747989,"And what makes you thinkthat note would interest me?","Rebecca"
"1563",6748158,6749824,"Oh, I'm not gonna bother youwith the contents now.","Rebecca"
"1564",6749993,6752161,"But I can assure youthat it is not the note of a woman","Rebecca"
"1565",6752328,6755247,"who intends to drown herselfthat same night.","Rebecca"
"1566",6758585,6762421,"By the way, what do you dowith old bones? Bury them?","Rebecca"
"1567",6763881,6766175,"However, for the time being...","Rebecca"
"1568",6768386,6771220,"You know, Max, I'm getting fed upwith my job as a motorcar salesman.","Rebecca"
"1569",6771389,6773140,"I don't know if you'veever experienced the feeling","Rebecca"
"1570",6773307,6775934,"of driving an expensive motorcarwhich isn't your own?","Rebecca"
"1571",6776269,6778729,"But it can be very, very exasperating.","Rebecca"
"1572",6778896,6781564,"You know what I mean.You want to own the car yourself.","Rebecca"
"1573",6781733,6784734,"I often wonder what it would be liketo retire to the country.","Rebecca"
"1574",6784903,6788113,"Have a nice little placewith a few acres of shooting.","Rebecca"
"1575",6788280,6789907,"I've never figured outwhat it would cost a year,","Rebecca"
"1576",6790073,6791992,"but I'd like to talk about it with you.","Rebecca"
"1577",6792159,6796162,"I'd like to have your advice on howto live comfortably without hard work.","Rebecca"
"1578",6797748,6800375,"Hello, Favell.You looking for me, Maxim?","Rebecca"
"1579",6800667,6801752,"Yes.","Rebecca"
"1580",6802712,6805546,"Mr. Favell and I have a littlebusiness transaction on hand.","Rebecca"
"1581",6805715,6808257,"I think we had better conduct itover at the inn.","Rebecca"
"1582",6808967,6811511,"They may have a private room there.","Rebecca"
"1583",6812639,6814389,"Well, see you later.","Rebecca"
"1584",6815641,6818685,"Find Colonel Julyan.Tell him I want to see him immediately.","Rebecca"
"1585",6819020,6820479,"Come on, Favell. Let's go.","Rebecca"
"1586",6825902,6830154,"- Have you a private room, please?- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.","Rebecca"
"1587",6833868,6835661,"Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.","Rebecca"
"1588",6835828,6838079,"Splendid. Splendid.Exactly like the Ritz.","Rebecca"
"1589",6838497,6839581,"Any orders, gents?","Rebecca"
"1590",6839748,6841750,"Yes. You might bring mea large brandy and soda.","Rebecca"
"1591",6841917,6845503,"How about you, Max? Have one on me.I feel I can afford to play host.","Rebecca"
"1592",6845671,6846838,"Thanks. I don't mind if I do.","Rebecca"
"1593",6847006,6848297,"Make it two, will you,like a good fellow?","Rebecca"
"1594",6848466,6850300,"- Very good, sir.- Where's Mr. De Winter?","Rebecca"
"1595",6850467,6852761,"Through the other door, sir.","Rebecca"
"1596",6852929,6855264,"Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.","Rebecca"
"1597",6856390,6858684,"Oh, I know Colonel Julyan.We're old friends, aren't we?","Rebecca"
"1598",6858851,6860769,"Since you're old friends,I assume you also know","Rebecca"
"1599",6860936,6862229,"he's head of the police here.","Rebecca"
"1600",6862396,6865189,"He might be interested to hear yourproposition. Tell him all about it.","Rebecca"
"1601",6865358,6867734,"I don't know what you mean. I merelysaid I hoped to give up selling cars","Rebecca"
"1602",6867902,6869027,"and retire into the country.","Rebecca"
"1603",6869194,6871697,"Actually, he offered to withhold a vitalpiece of evidence from the inquest","Rebecca"
"1604",6871864,6873489,"if I made it worth his while.","Rebecca"
"1605",6873658,6875742,"I only want to see justice done,Colonel.","Rebecca"
"1606",6875909,6878662,"Now, that boat builder's evidencesuggested certain possible theories","Rebecca"
"1607",6878829,6881664,"concerning Rebecca's death.One of them, of course, is suicide.","Rebecca"
"1608",6881832,6883833,"Now I have a little note herewhich I consider","Rebecca"
"1609",6884002,6886502,"puts that possibilityquite out of court.","Rebecca"
"1610",6886837,6888462,"Read it, Colonel.","Rebecca"
"1611",6888756,6890090,"""Jack, darling,","Rebecca"
"1612",6890257,6893385,"I've just seen the doctor and I'm goingdown to Manderley right away.","Rebecca"
"1613",6893552,6895011,"I shall be at the cottageall this evening","Rebecca"
"1614",6895179,6897180,"and shall leavethe door open for you.","Rebecca"
"1615",6897347,6899807,"I have something terriblyimportant to tell you.","Rebecca"
"1616",6899975,6900893,"Rebecca.""","Rebecca"
"1617",6901060,6902435,"Now, does that looklike the note of a woman","Rebecca"
"1618",6902604,6904520,"who had made up her mindto kill herself?","Rebecca"
"1619",6904689,6906064,"And apart from that,do you mean to tell me","Rebecca"
"1620",6906231,6908399,"that if you wanted to commit suicide,you would go to all the trouble","Rebecca"
"1621",6908568,6911069,"of putting out to sea in a boat,and then take a hammer and chisel","Rebecca"
"1622",6911237,6913947,"and laboriously knock holesthrough the bottom of it?","Rebecca"
"1623",6914114,6916490,"Come, Colonel. As an officer of the law,","Rebecca"
"1624",6916658,6919953,"don't you feel there are someslight grounds for suspicion?","Rebecca"
"1625",6920121,6921997,"- Of murder?- What else?","Rebecca"
"1626",6922332,6925583,"You've known Max a long time. Soyou know he's the old-fashioned type,","Rebecca"
"1627",6925752,6928962,"who'd die to defend his honor,or who'd kill for it.","Rebecca"
"1628",6929171,6931340,"It's blackmail, pure and simple.","Rebecca"
"1629",6931506,6933800,"Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.","Rebecca"
"1630",6933967,6936302,"It can bring a lot of troubleto a great many people.","Rebecca"
"1631",6936470,6939640,"And the blackmailer sometimesfinds himself in jail at the end of it.","Rebecca"
"1632",6939806,6942600,"Oh, I see. You're going to holdde Winter's hand through all this.","Rebecca"
"1633",6942769,6944685,"Just becausehe's the big noise around here","Rebecca"
"1634",6944854,6946604,"and he's actually permitted youto dine with him.","Rebecca"
"1635",6946773,6949565,"Be careful, Favell.You've brought an accusation of murder.","Rebecca"
"1636",6949734,6952109,"- Have you any witnesses?- I do have a witness.","Rebecca"
"1637",6952278,6953612,"It's that fellow, Ben.","Rebecca"
"1638",6953779,6955948,"If that stupid coroner hadn't beenas much of a snob as you are,","Rebecca"
"1639",6956114,6958115,"he'd have seenthat half-wit was hiding something.","Rebecca"
"1640",6958283,6959283,"And why should Ben do that?","Rebecca"
"1641",6959452,6960868,"Because we caught him once,Rebecca and I,","Rebecca"
"1642",6961037,6962954,"peering at us throughthe cottage window.","Rebecca"
"1643",6963122,6965666,"Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.That's why he was afraid to speak.","Rebecca"
"1644",6965832,6968542,"But he was always hanging about.He must have seen this whole thing.","Rebecca"
"1645",6968711,6971421,"It's ridiculous,even listening to all this.","Rebecca"
"1646",6971588,6974466,"You're like a little trade union,all of you, aren't you?","Rebecca"
"1647",6974634,6976676,"And if my guess is right, Crawley,","Rebecca"
"1648",6976844,6979930,"there's a bit of malice in your soultoward me, isn't there?","Rebecca"
"1649",6980097,6982640,"Crawley didn't havemuch success with Rebecca,","Rebecca"
"1650",6982809,6985644,"but he ought to havemore luck this time.","Rebecca"
"1651",6985811,6988689,"And the bride will be gratefulfor your fraternal arm, Crawley,","Rebecca"
"1652",6988855,6991649,"in a week or so.Every time she faints, in fact.","Rebecca"
"1653",6992025,6994444,"- De Winter!- Maxim, please!","Rebecca"
"1654",6995154,6996947,"That temper of yourswill do you in yet, Max.","Rebecca"
"1655",7001618,7003412,"Excuse me, gentlemen.","Rebecca"
"1656",7004287,7006747,"- Now is there anything else?- Yes.","Rebecca"
"1657",7007833,7009458,"You might bringMr. De Winter a sedative.","Rebecca"
"1658",7009627,7012003,"- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.- Very good.","Rebecca"
"1659",7015382,7017341,"Now, Favell,let's get this business over.","Rebecca"
"1660",7017510,7019427,"As you seem to have worked outthe whole thing so carefully,","Rebecca"
"1661",7019595,7021095,"perhaps you can provide usalso with a motive.","Rebecca"
"1662",7021264,7023724,"I knew you were goingto bring that up, Colonel.","Rebecca"
"1663",7023890,7027810,"I've read enough detective stories toknow that there must always be a motive.","Rebecca"
"1664",7027979,7031064,"And if you'll all excuse me,I might supply that, too.","Rebecca"
"1665",7032692,7035359,"I wish you'd go home. You oughtnot to be here through all this.","Rebecca"
"1666",7035528,7037112,"Please let me stay, Maxim.","Rebecca"
"1667",7037279,7039488,"Surely, Colonel Julyan, you'renot going to allow this fellow to...","Rebecca"
"1668",7039657,7042617,"My opinion of Favellis no higher than yours, Crawley.","Rebecca"
"1669",7042784,7045119,"But in my official capacity,I have no alternative","Rebecca"
"1670",7045287,7048539,"but to pursue his accusations.I entirely agree with you, Colonel.","Rebecca"
"1671",7048707,7051710,"In matters as serious as this,we must make sure of every point","Rebecca"
"1672",7051877,7053878,"and explore every avenue.","Rebecca"
"1673",7054212,7058132,"And in fact, if I may coin a phrase,leave no stone unturned.","Rebecca"
"1674",7058551,7062554,"Here she is, the missing link, thewitness who will help supply the motive.","Rebecca"
"1675",7063014,7065931,"Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.I believe you know everyone else.","Rebecca"
"1676",7066100,7067141,"Won't you sit down?","Rebecca"
"1677",7067310,7069519,"No offense, Colonel,but I think I'll put this to Danny.","Rebecca"
"1678",7069686,7070729,"She'll understand it more easily.","Rebecca"
"1679",7070896,7073230,"Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?","Rebecca"
"1680",7073565,7075942,"Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McCleanfrom the village.","Rebecca"
"1681",7076109,7079362,"Now, you heard.I said Rebecca's doctor in London.","Rebecca"
"1682",7081740,7082865,"I don't know anything about that.","Rebecca"
"1683",7083033,7085452,"Oh, don't give me that, Danny.You knew everything about Rebecca.","Rebecca"
"1684",7085619,7087662,"You knew she was in love with me,didn't you?","Rebecca"
"1685",7087829,7090207,"Surely you haven't forgottenthe good times she and I used to have","Rebecca"
"1686",7090373,7092583,"down at the cottage on the beach.","Rebecca"
"1687",7092752,7094836,"She had a right to amuse herself,didn't she?","Rebecca"
"1688",7095003,7098756,"Love was a game to her. Only a game.It made her laugh, I tell you.","Rebecca"
"1689",7098925,7101426,"She used to sit and rock with laughterat the lot of you.","Rebecca"
"1690",7101594,7105430,"Can you think of why Mrs. De Wintershould have taken her own life?","Rebecca"
"1691",7105847,7107056,"No, no. I refuse to believe it.","Rebecca"
"1692",7107225,7108975,"I knew everything about herand I won't believe it.","Rebecca"
"1693",7109143,7112020,"There. You see? It's impossible.She knows that as well as I do.","Rebecca"
"1694",7112188,7113229,"Now, listen to me, Danny.","Rebecca"
"1695",7113396,7114898,"We know that Rebecca wentto a doctor in London","Rebecca"
"1696",7115065,7117109,"on the last day of her life. Who was it?","Rebecca"
"1697",7117318,7118734,"I don't know.","Rebecca"
"1698",7119112,7120569,"I understand, Danny.","Rebecca"
"1699",7120738,7123573,"You think we're asking youto reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.","Rebecca"
"1700",7123740,7125699,"You're trying to defend her.But that's what I'm doing.","Rebecca"
"1701",7125868,7128453,"I'm trying to clear her nameof the suspicion of suicide.","Rebecca"
"1702",7128621,7132916,"Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested","Rebecca"
"1703",7133167,7134960,"that Mrs. De Winterwas deliberately murdered.","Rebecca"
"1704",7135127,7136711,"There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.","Rebecca"
"1705",7136878,7139547,"But there's one more thing you'll wantto know, the name of the murderer.","Rebecca"
"1706",7139715,7142801,"It's a lovely namethat rolls off the tongue so easily.","Rebecca"
"1707",7142969,7146470,"George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.","Rebecca"
"1708",7152686,7154311,"There was a doctor.","Rebecca"
"1709",7154646,7156648,"Mrs. De Winter sometimeswent to him privately.","Rebecca"
"1710",7156815,7158899,"She used to go to himeven before she was married.","Rebecca"
"1711",7159068,7162444,"We don't want reminiscences, Danny.What was his name?","Rebecca"
"1712",7170328,7173289,"Dr. Baker.165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.","Rebecca"
"1713",7173457,7176167,"There you are, Colonel.There's where you'll find your motive.","Rebecca"
"1714",7176335,7179337,"Go and question Dr. Baker.He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.","Rebecca"
"1715",7179505,7182047,"To confirm the factthat she was going to have a child.","Rebecca"
"1716",7182216,7184259,"A sweet, curly-headed little child.","Rebecca"
"1717",7184426,7187136,"It isn't true. It isn't true.She would have told me.","Rebecca"
"1718",7187345,7189680,"She told Max about it.Max knew he wasn't the father.","Rebecca"
"1719",7189849,7193310,"So, like the gentleman of the old schoolthat he is, he killed her.","Rebecca"
"1720",7193476,7196104,"I'm afraid we shallhave to question this Dr. Baker.","Rebecca"
"1721",7196271,7199940,"Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,I think I'd like to go along, too.","Rebecca"
"1722",7200109,7203069,"Yes. Unfortunately, I supposeyou have the right to ask that.","Rebecca"
"1723",7203237,7205488,"I'll see the coronerand have the inquest postponed","Rebecca"

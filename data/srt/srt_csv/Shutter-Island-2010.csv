"476",2128751,2129793,"Ah.","Shutter Island"
"477",2129960,2132670,"Although, personally,I think if a man beats you","Shutter Island"
"478",2132755,2137592,"and fucks half the women he sees,and no one will help you,","Shutter Island"
"479",2138302,2142097,"axing him isn't the leastunderstandable thing you could do.","Shutter Island"

"481",2146643,2151021,"What would I do if I did?I don't know the world anymore.","Shutter Island"

"491",2185474,2187016,"Deliverymen.","Shutter Island"
"492",2188018,2190644,"And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?","Shutter Island"
"493",2190730,2194315,"Yes. He talked about anger.","Shutter Island"

"506",2263760,2264927,"No.","Shutter Island"
"507",2266304,2267972,"Never heard of him.","Shutter Island"
"508",2273896,2275063,"She was coached.","Shutter Island"
"509",2275648,2278233,"She used practically the same wordsas Cawley and the nurse,","Shutter Island"
"510",2278317,2281735,"-like she'd been told exactly what to say.-Who's Andrew Laeddis?","Shutter Island"
"511",2286324,2290661,"You asked every one of those patientsback there about him. Who is he?","Shutter Island"
"512",2294500,2297960,"What the hell, boss?I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.","Shutter Island"
"513",2298045,2299920,"We just met, Chuck.","Shutter Island"
"514",2300338,2303925,"You've been on the beat for a long time.You've got a duty. You've got a career.","Shutter Island"
"515",2304010,2308429,"What I'm doing,it's not exactly by the book.","Shutter Island"
"516",2309849,2312641,"I don't give a damnabout by-the-book, boss.","Shutter Island"
"517",2312726,2315603,"I just wanna knowwhat the hell's going on.","Shutter Island"
"518",2319858,2322485,"When this case came over the wires,","Shutter Island"
"519",2323362,2326364,"I requested it specifically,you understand?","Shutter Island"
"520",2326782,2327990,"Why?","Shutter Island"
"521",2330244,2331952,"Andrew Laeddis,","Shutter Island"
"522",2332788,2334956,"he was the maintenance manin the apartment building","Shutter Island"

"524",2338251,2339501,"Okay.","Shutter Island"
"525",2341338,2343380,"He was also a firebug.","Shutter Island"
"526",2346177,2348802,"Andrew Laeddis lit the match","Shutter Island"
"527",2351556,2354476,"that caused the fire that killed my wife.","Shutter Island"
"528",2362693,2364152,"Let them out!","Shutter Island"
"529",2366822,2370157,"-What happened to Laeddis?-He got away with it.","Shutter Island"
"530",2370242,2372659,"Laeddis got away with itand then he disappeared.","Shutter Island"
"531",2372744,2375746,"About a year ago, I open up the paperand there he is.","Shutter Island"
"532",2375831,2380335,"Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scarfrom his right temple down to his left lip.","Shutter Island"
"533",2380418,2383880,"Eyes different colors.Not the type of face you'd forget.","Shutter Island"
"534",2383963,2387092,"He burned down a schoolhouse,killed two people,","Shutter Island"
"535",2387175,2388927,"said voices told him to do it.","Shutter Island"
"536",2389010,2391637,"First he went to prison,then he got transferred here.","Shutter Island"
"537",2391722,2393931,"-Then what?-Then nothing.","Shutter Island"
"538",2394016,2397768,"He vanished like he never existed.No record whatsoever.","Shutter Island"
"539",2397853,2400230,"Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.That leaves Ward C.","Shutter Island"
"540",2400313,2401606,"Or he could be dead.","Shutter Island"
"541",2401690,2404275,"So could Rachel Solando,for that matter.","Shutter Island"
"542",2404360,2406945,"Lot of places to hide a body here.","Shutter Island"
"543",2407737,2410657,"Only one placeno one would really notice.","Shutter Island"
"544",2422210,2426297,"That patient, Bridget Kearns,when she sent me for water,","Shutter Island"
"545",2426382,2429300,"she said something to you back there,didn't she?","Shutter Island"
"546",2429385,2430510,"No.","Shutter Island"
"547",2432429,2433721,"Come on, boss.","Shutter Island"

"558",2504293,2507586,"-You okay, boss?-Yeah, I'm all right.","Shutter Island"
"559",2514594,2516679,"So if Laeddis is here,","Shutter Island"

"561",2521893,2524186,"I'm not here to kill Laeddis.","Shutter Island"
"562",2531862,2534697,"If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice.","Shutter Island"
"563",2545458,2550088,"When we got through the gatesat Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.","Shutter Island"
"564",2558681,2564351,"The Kommandant tried to kill himselfbefore we got there, but he...","Shutter Island"
"565",2565521,2566813,"He botched it.","Shutter Island"
"566",2568356,2570358,"Took him an hour to die.","Shutter Island"
"567",2575530,2579199,"When I went outside,I saw all the bodies on the ground.","Shutter Island"
"568",2583664,2585373,"Too many to count.","Shutter Island"
"569",2612067,2613900,"Too many to imagine.","Shutter Island"
"570",2616530,2618239,"So, yeah, the...","Shutter Island"
"571",2620409,2622327,"The guards surrendered,we took their guns,","Shutter Island"
"572",2622411,2624329,"and we lined them up.","Shutter Island"
"573",2668539,2670666,"It wasn't warfare. It was...","Shutter Island"
"574",2672710,2674211,"It was murder.","Shutter Island"
"575",2677715,2680635,"Yeah, I've had enough of killing.","Shutter Island"
"576",2683137,2685139,"That's not why I'm here.","Shutter Island"
"577",2686182,2689018,"So what is this all about?","Shutter Island"
"578",2690269,2696150,"After Laeddis vanished, I started doingsome checking on Ashecliffe.","Shutter Island"
"579",2697652,2700737,"A lot of people know about this place,but no one wants to talk.","Shutter Island"
"580",2700822,2702322,"You know, it's like it...","Shutter Island"
"581",2702824,2704867,"It's like they're scared or something.","Shutter Island"
"582",2706829,2709914,"You know, this place is fundedby a special grant","Shutter Island"
"583",2710833,2713668,"from The HouseUn-American Activities Committee?","Shutter Island"
"584",2713751,2716920,"HUAC? And how exactlyare we fighting the communists","Shutter Island"
"585",2717005,2719340,"from an island in Boston Harbor?","Shutter Island"
"586",2719967,2722592,"By conducting experiments on the mind.","Shutter Island"
"587",2724012,2725471,"At least that's my guess.","Shutter Island"
"588",2725556,2727264,"And you think that's going on here?","Shutter Island"
"589",2727349,2729851,"Like I said, no one would talk, right?","Shutter Island"
"590",2729934,2732603,"Till I found somebodywho used to be a patient here.","Shutter Island"
"591",2732688,2737065,"Guy's name is George Noyce.Nice college kid. Socialist.","Shutter Island"
"592",2737150,2739193,"He gets offered some moneyto do a psych study.","Shutter Island"
"593",2739277,2740652,"Guess what they were testing?","Shutter Island"
"594",2740737,2741820,"Toothpaste.","Shutter Island"
"595",2741905,2744282,"So, he startsseeing dragons everywhere.","Shutter Island"
"596",2744365,2749369,"He almost beats his professor to death.Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.","Shutter Island"
"597",2750038,2753498,"They release him after one year, right?And what does he do?","Shutter Island"
"598",2753583,2758503,"Two weeks on the mainland, he walksinto a bar, stabs three men to death.","Shutter Island"
"599",2759297,2764010,"His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,he stands up in the courtroom and he...","Shutter Island"
"600",2764094,2768556,"He begs the judge for the electric chair.Anywhere but a mental hospital.","Shutter Island"
"601",2769182,2771768,"Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.","Shutter Island"
"602",2772811,2775605,"-And you found him.-Yeah, I found him.","Shutter Island"
"603",2775688,2778190,"Well, he's a mess.","Shutter Island"
"604",2779777,2781902,"But it's pretty clearfrom what he tells me.","Shutter Island"
"605",2781987,2783112,"What?","Shutter Island"
"606",2783197,2785239,"They're experimenting on people here.","Shutter Island"
"607",2786032,2787742,"I don't know, boss.","Shutter Island"
"608",2789036,2792288,"-How do you believe a crazy guy?-That's the beauty of it, isn't it?","Shutter Island"
"609",2792371,2796626,"Crazy people, they're the perfectsubjects. They talk, nobody listens.","Shutter Island"
"610",2797210,2798878,"I stood at Dachau.","Shutter Island"
"611",2799128,2803800,"We saw what human beings are capableof doing to each other, right?","Shutter Island"
"612",2803884,2806469,"For Christ's sakes, we foughta goddamn war to stop them,","Shutter Island"
"613",2806552,2811431,"and now... Now I find out it may behappening here? On our soil? No.","Shutter Island"
"614",2812601,2815228,"So what are you really here to do, Ted?","Shutter Island"
"615",2815938,2819731,"I'm gonna get the proof,I'm gonna go back,","Shutter Island"
"616",2819817,2822068,"and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.","Shutter Island"
"617",2822777,2824110,"That's it.","Shutter Island"
"618",2824905,2826405,"Wait a minute.","Shutter Island"
"619",2826989,2829784,"You started asking aroundabout Ashecliffe,","Shutter Island"
"620",2829867,2831284,"waiting for a chance to get out here,","Shutter Island"
"621",2831369,2833954,"and then suddenlythey need a U.S. Marshal?","Shutter Island"
"622",2834039,2837916,"Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patientescape. It was the perfect excuse.","Shutter Island"
"623",2838001,2841003,"No, no, no, boss.Luck doesn't work that way.","Shutter Island"
"624",2841088,2842755,"The world doesn't work that way.","Shutter Island"
"625",2842840,2846132,"They got an electrified fencearound a septic facility.","Shutter Island"
"626",2846217,2849344,"Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?","Shutter Island"
"627",2849429,2853099,"A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?Funding from HUAC?","Shutter Island"
"628",2853182,2857769,"I mean, Jesus Christ, everything aboutthis place stinks of government ops.","Shutter Island"
"629",2857855,2859856,"-What if they wanted you here?-Bullshit.","Shutter Island"
"630",2859940,2862065,"-You were asking questions.-Bullshit! Bullshit!","Shutter Island"
"631",2862150,2863650,"Bullshit. We came herefor Rachel Solando.","Shutter Island"
"632",2863735,2866612,"Where's one shred of evidenceshe even existed?","Shutter Island"
"633",2866697,2867864,"There's no way they could've known","Shutter Island"
"634",2867947,2869322,"I'd be assigned to this case.There's no way.","Shutter Island"
"635",2869407,2872742,"What if while you were looking intothem, they were looking into you?","Shutter Island"
"636",2872827,2876038,"All they had to do was fake an escapeto get you here, and now they have you.","Shutter Island"
"637",2876123,2877914,"Now they have us both. Here! Now!","Shutter Island"
"638",2882170,2884505,"Marshals, are you out here?","Shutter Island"

"648",2929800,2934137,"I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.Should be ready by tomorrow.","Shutter Island"
"649",2934222,2937016,"That is, if we all don't wash away first.","Shutter Island"
"650",2937099,2941561,"You know, speaking of which, I'm afraidyour smokes are pretty much done for.","Shutter Island"
"651",2942146,2943313,"So...","Shutter Island"
"652",2944983,2947108,"This is our only choice, huh?","Shutter Island"
"653",2947193,2950237,"Got something really nice ina prison gray if that don't work for you.","Shutter Island"
"654",2950322,2953239,"Now that you mention it,these are just fine.","Shutter Island"
"655",2953951,2957036,"That's why I must repeat my insistencethat all Ward C patients","Shutter Island"
"656",2957119,2959371,"be placed in manual restraints.","Shutter Island"
"657",2959456,2962791,"If the facility floods, they'll drown.You know that.","Shutter Island"
"658",2963251,2964501,"That would takea lot of flooding.","Shutter Island"
"659",2964585,2965543,"We're on an island","Shutter Island"
"660",2965628,2967253,"in the middle of the oceanduring a hurricane.","Shutter Island"
"661",2967338,2970007,"A lot of flooding seemslike a distinct possibility.","Shutter Island"
"662",2970092,2972425,"It's a gamble, Stephen.Say the power fails.","Shutter Island"
"663",2972510,2973760,"There's a backup generator.","Shutter Island"
"664",2973844,2976554,"And if that goes,the cell doors will open.","Shutter Island"
"665",2978099,2980351,"Where are they going to go? Mmm?","Shutter Island"
"666",2980434,2983436,"They can't just hop a ferry, scoot overto the mainland and wreak havoc.","Shutter Island"
"667",2983521,2984521,"Oh, you're quite right.","Shutter Island"
"668",2984606,2987775,"They're far more likelyto wreak havoc right here on us.","Shutter Island"
"669",2988693,2991612,"If they're manacled to the floor,they'll die.","Shutter Island"
"670",2991947,2993822,"This is 24 human beings.","Shutter Island"
"671",2994449,2995782,"And you can live with that, can you?","Shutter Island"
"672",2995951,2999954,"Well, frankly, if it were up to me,I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B","Shutter Island"

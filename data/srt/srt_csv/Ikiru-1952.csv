"534",3920765,3924201,"He makes 200 yen more a monththan I do,","Ikiru"

"552",4084195,4087790,"In a word, your stockings had holes.","Ikiru"
"553",4088365,4093564,"But the holes in my stockingsdon't bother your legs.","Ikiru"
"554",4093771,4096069,"It's just that I...","Ikiru"

"592",4371148,4373116,"You look so tired.","Ikiru"
"593",4373317,4377845,"But I had a trulymarvelous day today.","Ikiru"
"594",4378789,4382156,"But you snored throughthe best part of the movie.","Ikiru"
"595",4384695,4389325,"It's just that I overdid ita little last night.","Ikiru"
"596",4395072,4396835,"Kimura-san...","Ikiru"
"597",4411822,4416316,"I really can't...This isn't the sort of thing","Ikiru"

"602",4436013,4437071,"Oh, no,","Ikiru"
"603",4437281,4443277,"it's not that I mind youcalling me a mummy.","Ikiru"

"605",4449493,4452860,"In other words, I don't blame you.","Ikiru"
"606",4454998,4458627,"It's just that the reason","Ikiru"
"607",4459236,4462296,"I made myself into a mummy...","Ikiru"
"608",4463540,4467670,"In other words, I did it all","Ikiru"
"609",4468045,4470639,"for my son's sake.","Ikiru"
"610",4472115,4476779,"But as it turned out, my son","Ikiru"
"611",4476987,4480980,"doesn't seem to give a whit.","Ikiru"
"612",4485128,4488359,"But you can't blame it allon your son.","Ikiru"
"613",4489333,4490800,"Isn't that right?","Ikiru"
"614",4491001,4494698,"Not unless he asked youto make a mummy of yourself.","Ikiru"

"618",4517027,4519188,"And I'm grateful she had me.","Ikiru"
"619",4519396,4521557,"But it's not my fault I was born.","Ikiru"
"620",4526603,4530369,"What's the matter with you,bad-mouthing your son to me?","Ikiru"
"621",4534444,4536139,"It's just...","Ikiru"
"622",4540283,4542581,"You know you still adore him.","Ikiru"
"623",4583093,4586324,"No end in sightfor the electricity shortage.","Ikiru"
"624",4586563,4588656,"Is that a fact?","Ikiru"
"625",4630207,4634576,"They say we haven't hadsuch a heat wave in 30 years.","Ikiru"
"626",4638415,4640042,"I see.","Ikiru"

"629",4670847,4674044,"I know I should havetold you sooner,","Ikiru"
"630",4674718,4678882,"but it's not very pleasant business.","Ikiru"
"631",4679089,4681717,"Father, let's drop it.","Ikiru"
"632",4682192,4686026,"You see, I discussed itwith Uncle today,","Ikiru"
"633",4686229,4689665,"and we have to address thisto avoid complications later.","Ikiru"
"634",4689866,4693165,"For instance, we have our rightsas your heirs.","Ikiru"
"635",4693370,4694928,"To avoid misunderstandings...","Ikiru"
"636",4695172,4696172,"- Mitsuo!- Fact is,","Ikiru"

"639",4701845,4705713,"Father, we respect your rightto freedom of expression.","Ikiru"
"640",4705916,4708384,"We accept your degenerate behavior.","Ikiru"
"641",4708585,4711247,"But we do havesome basic conditions.","Ikiru"
"642",4711454,4715891,"Think of Kazue or, putting her aside,of her family back home.","Ikiru"
"643",4716092,4719289,"How dare you bringa woman like that home.","Ikiru"
"644",4719529,4725058,"And holding hands with her in your room.I could hardly face the maid.","Ikiru"
"645",4762939,4769071,"It's been two weeks now sinceour protagonist abandoned his spot.","Ikiru"
"646",4778655,4780145,"During that time,","Ikiru"
"647",4780357,4785954,"various rumors and speculationshave swirled around our Watanabe-san.","Ikiru"
"648",4801311,4805247,"All these rumorsand speculations coincide perfectly","Ikiru"
"649",4805415,4810045,"with the notion that our Watanabe-sanis being very foolish indeed.","Ikiru"
"650",4812222,4817125,"But Watanabe himself hasnever taken his actions so seriously","Ikiru"
"651",4817327,4819522,"in his entire life.","Ikiru"
"652",4821531,4823158,"This isn't the city office,","Ikiru"
"653",4823366,4828065,"where you waste a whole dayon an hour's work. It's more serious.","Ikiru"

"658",4841384,4844319,"Besides, why are you alwaystaking me out?","Ikiru"
"659",4844521,4845521,"It's just...","Ikiru"
"660",4846690,4850387,"Let's stop doing this.It doesn't feel right.","Ikiru"
"661",4850593,4854393,"But, then, just one more night, okay?","Ikiru"

"665",4952796,4955287,"Shall we go for a stroll?","Ikiru"
"666",4955498,4956863,"I've had it.","Ikiru"
"667",4957100,4960934,"Next it'll be a sweet shop,then a sushi or noodle joint.","Ikiru"
"668",4962038,4964802,"What's the point of it all?","Ikiru"
"669",4965842,4970973,"I feel badly that you keep treating me,but I've had it up to here.","Ikiru"
"670",4971881,4975476,"Besides, we've both run outof things to say.","Ikiru"
"671",4978721,4980951,"There's that face again.","Ikiru"
"672",4982392,4985486,"The truth is,you give me the creeps.","Ikiru"
"673",4995839,4999468,"What's going on?Why do you chase me around like this?","Ikiru"
"674",4999943,5002776,"- In other words...- In other words, what?","Ikiru"
"675",5003146,5009051,"In other words, I really enjoyspending time with you this way.","Ikiru"
"676",5009252,5011152,"Keep your old man's infatuation.","Ikiru"
"677",5011354,5015120,"No, it's just that I...","Ikiru"
"678",5015358,5019886,"Why can't you spit it out,instead of always dribbling?","Ikiru"
"679",5024567,5026501,"- Are you mad?- No.","Ikiru"
"680",5034644,5039604,"I don't even know myself","Ikiru"

"683",5072182,5076175,"You see, I'm going to die soon.","Ikiru"
"684",5077020,5079921,"I've got stomach cancer.It's right here.","Ikiru"

"688",5100210,5106479,"I know. I nearly drowned in a pondonce when I was a child.","Ikiru"
"689",5106649,5108913,"I felt exactly the same way then.","Ikiru"
"690",5109118,5111552,"Everything seems black.","Ikiru"

"696",5129539,5132303,"No, you really don't understand.","Ikiru"
"697",5133543,5136910,"My son is somewhere far, far away.","Ikiru"
"698",5138548,5140573,"Just as my parents were","Ikiru"
"699",5140783,5145083,"when I was drowning in that pond.","Ikiru"
"700",5145321,5150884,"It hurts me even to thinkabout him now.","Ikiru"

"703",5157300,5160861,"When I look at you,it warms me up","Ikiru"
"704",5161037,5163938,"right here.","Ikiru"
"705",5164307,5168141,"This old... this old mummy...","Ikiru"
"706",5174784,5178880,"In other words, you're like,you seem like my family...","Ikiru"
"707",5179055,5185824,"No, that's not right. You're youngand you're healthy, so that's why...","Ikiru"
"708",5188631,5192032,"No, that's not right.In other words,","Ikiru"
"709",5193703,5197469,"in other words, why are you soincredibly alive?","Ikiru"
"710",5197674,5199471,"You're just so alive.","Ikiru"
"711",5199676,5205637,"That's why I'm envious.This old mummy envies you.","Ikiru"
"712",5206482,5210179,"Before I die, I want to livejust one day like you do.","Ikiru"
"713",5210386,5213378,"I'll live that way before I die.","Ikiru"
"714",5213623,5217457,"Until I've done it,I can't just give up and die.","Ikiru"
"715",5217660,5219719,"In other words, I just...","Ikiru"

"718",5231040,5233338,"No, maybe you don't, but you...","Ikiru"
"719",5233543,5234669,"But I don't...","Ikiru"
"720",5234877,5237368,"No, tell me, how can I be like you?","Ikiru"
"721",5237580,5241311,"- But all I do is work and eat...- And what else?","Ikiru"
"722",5241551,5243519,"That's all.","Ikiru"
"723",5250059,5254257,"I mean it.All I do is make these little things.","Ikiru"
"724",5263906,5266397,"Even making these is so much fun.","Ikiru"
"725",5266609,5270909,"Making them, I feel like I'm playingwith every baby in Japan.","Ikiru"
"726",5272849,5275374,"Why don't you trymaking something too?","Ikiru"
"727",5276853,5279788,"What can I possibly makeat that office?","Ikiru"
"728",5281290,5287058,"You're right. It's just impossibleto make anything there. So quit and go...","Ikiru"

"730",5333543,5335602,"It's not too late.","Ikiru"
"731",5336312,5338837,"No, it's not impossible.","Ikiru"
"732",5339015,5343645,"I know I can do something there.I just have to find the will.","Ikiru"
"733",5351928,5355728,"There is something I can do...","Ikiru"
"734",5392602,5397938,"It's a matter of time before he resigns.His son came yesterday about his pension.","Ikiru"
"735",5399108,5402009,"Which meansyou'll finally be section chief.","Ikiru"
"736",5402178,5404408,"Well, you never know.","Ikiru"
"737",5447423,5449050,"Good morning.","Ikiru"

"753",5540483,5544180,"The protagonist of our story has died.","Ikiru"
"754",5589298,5592461,"Let us see the deputy mayor.He's here, right?","Ikiru"
"755",5592735,5595727,"Five minutes.Just five minutes, please.","Ikiru"
"756",5606882,5609680,"What should I tell them?","Ikiru"

"759",5642852,5644444,"Deputy Mayor, sir.","Ikiru"
"760",5644653,5648919,"Although technically the Parks Dept.and the Ward Committee built that park","Ikiru"
"761",5649125,5653562,"with your backing, wasn't it reallyWatanabe-san who built it?","Ikiru"
"762",5653729,5654729,"That's the word.","Ikiru"
"763",5654864,5658425,"But Watanabe was section chiefof Public Affairs.","Ikiru"
"764",5658634,5661762,"The Park Department builds parks.","Ikiru"
"765",5661971,5664565,"Sure, we understand that.But actually,","Ikiru"
"766",5664740,5670178,"we're talking about the man whokept the plan alive and saw it through.","Ikiru"
"767",5670379,5673940,"The community residents believethat was Watanabe-san.","Ikiru"
"768",5674150,5678849,"They're all worried about whyWatanabe-san died in the park he created.","Ikiru"
"769",5679054,5680681,"What do you mean?","Ikiru"
"770",5680890,5684849,"Well, they had reservationslong before this.","Ikiru"
"771",5685060,5689121,"You never mentioned Watanabe-sanin the speech you gave","Ikiru"
"772",5689331,5692300,"at the park's opening ceremony.","Ikiru"
"773",5692501,5694628,"They don't even call it a speech.","Ikiru"
"774",5694837,5696270,"What was it, then?","Ikiru"
"775",5696438,5698963,"Electioneering.","Ikiru"
"776",5701010,5701976,"And also,","Ikiru"
"777",5701977,5705344,"that Watanabe-san was snubbedat the ceremony","Ikiru"
"778",5705548,5707982,"and seated in the back row.","Ikiru"
"779",5708184,5712518,"In other words, general sympathyfor Watanabe-san","Ikiru"
"780",5712721,5717090,"has given rise to a specialinterpretation of his death at the park.","Ikiru"
"781",5718227,5723756,"Meaning that his was an act of silentprotest against city officials.","Ikiru"
"782",5723933,5728700,"So you're saying that Watanabecommitted suicide,","Ikiru"
"783",5728904,5733136,"or at least was prepared to,when he froze to death there?","Ikiru"
"784",5734543,5735908,"More or less.","Ikiru"
"785",5737079,5742813,"It was snowing last night.Sounds like a scene right out of a play.","Ikiru"
"786",5744753,5745753,"However,","Ikiru"
"787",5746755,5752785,"the truth is, an autopsy has clearlyestablished Watanabe's cause of death.","Ikiru"
"788",5753062,5758500,"He neither committed suicide nor frozeto death. He died of stomach cancer.","Ikiru"
"789",5759735,5761794,"- Stomach cancer?- Right.","Ikiru"
"790",5761971,5763871,"Intestinal hemorrhaging.","Ikiru"
"791",5764073,5768373,"Watanabe died suddenly,when he himself had no idea.","Ikiru"
"792",5768911,5771812,"If you've any doubts...Ohno,","Ikiru"
"793",5772181,5774706,"refer them to his hospital.","Ikiru"
"794",5848991,5850822,"It doesn't sit right.","Ikiru"
"795",5852494,5856225,"These newspapermenand their lack of sensitivity.","Ikiru"
"796",5856398,5861233,"Actually, it appliesto the general public.","Ikiru"
"797",5861937,5867034,"Their fundamental antipathy towardscity officials will never do.","Ikiru"
"798",5871380,5874508,"They just don't understandhow we function.","Ikiru"
"799",5874850,5878581,"Take that little park in Kuroe,for instance.","Ikiru"
"800",5878754,5883487,"Apparently the public seems to believethat Watanabe built it.","Ikiru"
"801",5883692,5885956,"But that's ridiculous.","Ikiru"
"802",5886628,5888653,"I hate to say this at his wake.","Ikiru"
"803",5890299,5896397,"And maybe I shouldn't,in front of his family and relatives,","Ikiru"
"804",5897573,5902374,"but I'll go ahead because I knowWatanabe himself would disagree.","Ikiru"
"805",5903912,5908508,"Watanabe certainly wentto great pains","Ikiru"
"806",5908717,5911880,"to make that park.","Ikiru"
"807",5912087,5915716,"I take my hat off to his passion.","Ikiru"
"808",5916425,5920521,"But all his efforts werein the context of his office.","Ikiru"
"809",5924533,5927627,"The idea that he went beyondthe scope of his office","Ikiru"
"810",5927803,5930431,"to facilitate citizens' desires,","Ikiru"
"811",5930672,5933641,"and actually made the park himself,","Ikiru"
"812",5933809,5936972,"is nonsensical to thosewho understand our bureaucracy.","Ikiru"
"813",5940149,5943550,"I'm sure Watanabe himself is wincing.","Ikiru"
"814",5949425,5951017,"However,","Ikiru"
"815",5952361,5958231,"given that such rumors are surfacing,perhaps we may have been remiss.","Ikiru"
"816",5958834,5963737,"Everyone focused on that historicproject that rushed through construction.","Ikiru"
"817",5963939,5967670,"Maybe we should have singled outsomeone's service.","Ikiru"
"818",5967843,5969242,"For instance,","Ikiru"
"819",5969945,5972140,"section chiefof the Parks Department.","Ikiru"
"820",5973048,5977917,"Or his superior,the division chief in Engineering.","Ikiru"
"821",5980389,5986055,"That's what you say, Deputy Mayor,but here's what I think.","Ikiru"
"822",5986261,5992166,"All the Parks' section chief and I didwas follow the dictates of our office.","Ikiru"
"823",5992401,5996132,"But when you bear in mindyour own struggles","Ikiru"
"824",5996338,6000934,"to rein in that notoriously politicalCity Council,","Ikiru"
"825",6001143,6003737,"and realize the park's construction,","Ikiru"
"826",6003946,6007712,"it's you, Deputy Mayor,who should be singled out.","Ikiru"
"827",6009151,6010618,"None of that, now.","Ikiru"
"828",6011987,6016617,"Some people have even criticizedmy speech at the opening ceremony.","Ikiru"
"829",6017292,6018657,"Isn't that right, Ohno?","Ikiru"
"830",6018861,6023195,"Some even sayI was electioneering.","Ikiru"
"831",6025000,6028868,"Excuse me.The residents of Kuroe","Ikiru"
"832",6029104,6032767,"are here asking to burn incensefor the deceased.","Ikiru"
"833",6158600,6161433,"Dear.Mitsuo-san.","Ikiru"
"834",6285994,6288087,"It sure is cold.","Ikiru"
"835",6288663,6290597,"May I pour one for you?","Ikiru"
"836",6292300,6294461,"Oh, no, I'll go get warm sake.","Ikiru"
"837",6295003,6300270,"What do you say?Why don't you all move closer down here?","Ikiru"
"838",6300709,6301971,"Why not?","Ikiru"
"839",6303745,6305645,"- Over here, please.- Thanks.","Ikiru"
"840",6306348,6308578,"Hayashi-san.","Ikiru"
"841",6324366,6325663,"Here, Ohno-san.","Ikiru"
"842",6328370,6331203,"Have all the big shots goneto a meeting?","Ikiru"
"843",6331540,6332540,"Yes.","Ikiru"
"844",6333842,6336936,"No, they couldn't stand to stay here.","Ikiru"
"845",6338980,6343940,"I don't care what anyone says.It was Watanabe-san who made that park.","Ikiru"
"846",6345020,6348387,"In their hearts, the deputy mayorand his people know...","Ikiru"
"847",6349024,6352551,"That's going too far.As the deputy mayor said...","Ikiru"
"848",6352761,6357095,"That's right. I'm not saying thisbecause I'm in the Parks Department,","Ikiru"
"849",6357332,6360893,"but we planned, budgetedand built that park.","Ikiru"
"850",6361670,6365106,"No, that's not what I mean.","Ikiru"
"851",6365674,6368643,"Let it go. I can understandyour feelings, but...","Ikiru"
"852",6368810,6371779,"The point is,he was in Public Affairs.","Ikiru"
"853",6372013,6375744,"How dare he even think aboutmaking a park.","Ikiru"
"854",6375951,6378010,"Violating our bureaucratic turf.","Ikiru"
"855",6378220,6383715,"No, if you've got to credit something,it was coincidence that made that park.","Ikiru"
"856",6383925,6386120,"- But in that...- Just listen.","Ikiru"
"857",6386361,6391060,"City council members hadan upcoming election to consider,","Ikiru"
"858",6391633,6395933,"and the concession owners sniffeda possible restaurant row,","Ikiru"
"859",6396137,6400403,"and all that sure sped up workon that landfill site.","Ikiru"
"860",6400742,6402039,"- That's right.- Yes.","Ikiru"
"861",6402244,6404235,"That's exactly right.","Ikiru"
"862",6405747,6408580,"But I just can't figure it out.","Ikiru"
"863",6409584,6416615,"Why would anyone with his personalitysuddenly up and change like that?","Ikiru"
"864",6424666,6426725,"Right, it's a total mystery.","Ikiru"
"865",6426935,6428903,"That's right, exactly.","Ikiru"
"866",6429104,6434098,"In other words, with the benefitof hindsight, it's obvious.","Ikiru"
"867",6434509,6439378,"Watanabe-san must've knownhe had stomach cancer.","Ikiru"
"868",6439548,6440447,"That's why...","Ikiru"
"869",6440448,6442916,"Oh, we were just discussing","Ikiru"
"870",6443118,6446781,"whether or not your father knewhe had stomach cancer.","Ikiru"
"871",6447155,6450522,"Well, if he'd known, I'm surehe would have told me.","Ikiru"
"872",6450759,6451759,"I see.","Ikiru"
"873",6451760,6457460,"But I believe my father was fortunateto die without realizing he had cancer.","Ikiru"
"874",6457666,6460328,"Because that diseaseis a death sentence.","Ikiru"
"875",6460535,6464733,"I see. Well, that knocks outSaito's theory.","Ikiru"
"876",6464973,6466531,"What's that theory?","Ikiru"
"877",6467042,6471206,"It's just that five months ago,something transformed him.","Ikiru"
"878",6471446,6472538,"You're right.","Ikiru"
"879",6472781,6477081,"And none of us could makeheads or tails of what had changed him.","Ikiru"
"880",6477319,6480311,"Well, that's the woman's touch.","Ikiru"
"881",6480522,6482183,"A young mistress' hormones","Ikiru"
"882",6482390,6488124,"can temporarily revivean old man. Happens all the time.","Ikiru"
"883",6488496,6491829,"Put a real sheen back on his cheeks.","Ikiru"
"884",6492033,6496993,"The truth is, he'd recentlyfound a way to buff that sheen.","Ikiru"
"885",6498173,6500641,"Right.That explains that rakish hat.","Ikiru"
"886",6500842,6505438,"You're right. Frankly, that hatwas quite a shocker.","Ikiru"
"887",6508683,6511652,"Section Chief,I think that's a little impossible.","Ikiru"
"888",6511853,6514549,"No, not if we set our minds to it.","Ikiru"
"889",6525367,6526857,"But...","Ikiru"
"890",6561936,6563870,"My point is,","Ikiru"
"891",6564072,6568270,"there was something extraordinaryabout his dedication.","Ikiru"
"892",6568476,6569636,"Yes, that's right.","Ikiru"
"893",6571946,6577885,"I don't mean to argue, but a woman'stouch alone can't account for...","Ikiru"
"894",6578086,6579519,"- But...- Dear.","Ikiru"
"895",6579688,6581986,"The thing is...","Ikiru"
"896",6584893,6586861,"Just doesn't...","Ikiru"
"897",6590999,6594298,"Not to change the subject,","Ikiru"
"898",6594502,6599906,"but there were times when his doggeddedication threatened to derail it all.","Ikiru"
"899",6600408,6603707,"That's city hall for you.Gotta guard your turf.","Ikiru"
"900",6603912,6607609,"What I just can't wrapmy head around","Ikiru"
"901",6607849,6611182,"is why a 30-year veteranof the place suddenly...","Ikiru"
"902",6611386,6613411,"That's because Watanabe-san...","Ikiru"
"903",6619728,6621161,"In any event,","Ikiru"
"904",6621329,6625095,"hawking that park proposal of hisaround every section","Ikiru"
"905",6625300,6628861,"practically guaranteedeveryone would dig in their heels.","Ikiru"
"906",6629070,6634872,"Including our own section chief.Parks were our business, not Watanabe's.","Ikiru"
"907",6636544,6639570,"We have our own proposalsfor new parks.","Ikiru"
"908",6639781,6645378,"Can't you reconsider?This site is really terrible.","Ikiru"
"909",6645587,6648647,"But making a park isn't as simple","Ikiru"
"910",6648890,6651757,"as you outline in your proposal.","Ikiru"
"911",6651960,6654451,"No, this proposal is just a...","Ikiru"
"912",6654662,6656186,"I understand.","Ikiru"
"913",6656664,6661294,"I'll take my timeand go over it thoroughly.","Ikiru"
"914",6665607,6668940,"But the thing is, ultimately,the parks' section chief","Ikiru"
"915",6669144,6672409,"caved in to his peculiar determination.","Ikiru"
"916",6672614,6676641,"You've got a point there.Our section chief gave in, too.","Ikiru"
"917",6741716,6743809,"He was something.","Ikiru"
"918",6744018,6747215,"Watanabe waited daysfor the answer he wanted.","Ikiru"
"919",6747422,6752086,"Our section chief used tosneak around, trying to avoid him.","Ikiru"
"920",6752327,6753327,"That's right.","Ikiru"
"921",6764772,6768503,"Engineering Section Chief,Section Chief.","Ikiru"
"922",6771112,6776982,"Couldn't believe he stoopedto flattering peons like me.","Ikiru"
"923",6777418,6779648,"Won't you please...","Ikiru"
"924",6782423,6784084,"Isn't there a way...","Ikiru"
"925",6808082,6809743,"Finally, we took pity on him.","Ikiru"
"926",6811352,6815186,"That's right. In the endwe all took pity on him.","Ikiru"
"927",6815356,6818985,"But, hey, you guys in Administration,","Ikiru"
"928",6819594,6822085,"you were the worst of all.","Ikiru"
"929",6822330,6823330,"That's not...","Ikiru"
"930",6823364,6826856,"No, I always went with him,so I know.","Ikiru"
"931",6827035,6830732,"You made us beg for two weeks.How could I forget?","Ikiru"
"932",6830939,6832463,"I'm sorry.","Ikiru"
"933",6833708,6838145,"But then, remember that shocker?","Ikiru"
"934",6841182,6843446,"Yeah, what a shocker.","Ikiru"
"935",6878286,6880846,"DEPUTY MAYOR'S OFFICE","Ikiru"
"936",6889163,6892155,"But you knowwhat was even more shocking?","Ikiru"
"937",6892367,6894198,"The thing with the deputy mayor?","Ikiru"
"938",6894836,6897327,"I heard, I heard.What a shock.","Ikiru"
"939",6900975,6904877,"A lowly section chiefopenly defying the deputy mayor.","Ikiru"
"940",6905079,6906979,"Made history at City Hall.","Ikiru"
"941",6916324,6919725,"About that new park.","Ikiru"
"942",6920461,6922759,"It's one thing to show initiative,","Ikiru"
"943",6922997,6927730,"but you don't want people to thinkof you as self-aggrandizing.","Ikiru"
"944",6928202,6932002,"And the City Council's gotproblems of its own.","Ikiru"
"945",6932573,6937101,"I think it's best you give upthat proposal.","Ikiru"
"946",6938046,6941675,"Last night, we were treatedto a geisha party.","Ikiru"
"947",6941883,6945182,"Man, geisha these daysare appalling.","Ikiru"
"948",6945386,6949652,"One of 'em spent the whole eveningsulking and clammed up.","Ikiru"
"949",6949824,6954022,"The madam said she wasa student, a moonlighter.","Ikiru"
"950",6955596,6956893,"That's a laugh.","Ikiru"
"951",6962970,6966064,"Won't you please...","Ikiru"
"952",6968242,6969903,"reconsider this proposal...","Ikiru"
"953",6975616,6978744,"What did you just say?","Ikiru"
"954",6980588,6981588,"Yes.","Ikiru"
"955",6985560,6986891,"Um...","Ikiru"
"956",6988262,6992255,"About that park,","Ikiru"
"957",6993968,6997301,"won't you reconsider your decision?","Ikiru"
"958",7040681,7042672,"But the thing is,","Ikiru"
"959",7042917,7047411,"when you think back, was it worthhis taking it that far?","Ikiru"
"960",7047622,7049920,"He was crazy.","Ikiru"
"961",7050124,7054288,"It's just that in City Halleveryone's guarding his own turf.","Ikiru"
"962",7055062,7059328,"But after that, the deputy mayordid reconsider. So...","Ikiru"
"963",7059534,7063493,"No, because the City Council rode him.Coincidence, in other words.","Ikiru"
"964",7063704,7069301,"It's too sentimental to attribute it allto Watanabe-san's dedication.","Ikiru"
"965",7070278,7071278,"Sentimental...","Ikiru"
"966",7071979,7075642,"Is that so?I don't see it that way.","Ikiru"
"967",7076050,7081249,"The point is, the world is a dark placeif his dedication was pointless.","Ikiru"
"968",7081522,7083149,"It is a dark place.","Ikiru"
"969",7086194,7087627,"First of all,","Ikiru"
"970",7087828,7091992,"just the sight of Watanabe-san.It was like","Ikiru"
"971",7092200,7095192,"he kept himself goingwith nothing but work.","Ikiru"
"972",7095403,7098031,"Wasn't that how it seemed?","Ikiru"
"973",7098706,7102267,"Sometimes he evengave me the chills.","Ikiru"
"974",7104111,7107478,"When was that? I was...","Ikiru"
"975",7152760,7157891,"It reminds me of seeing himat that construction site.","Ikiru"
"976",7254528,7258897,"How can I put it?The way he gazed out over the site,","Ikiru"
"977",7259133,7263900,"like a father or grandfathertenderly watching a favorite child...","Ikiru"
"978",7264138,7266038,"Of course it was.","Ikiru"
"979",7266240,7268765,"Because Watanabe-sancherished that park.","Ikiru"
"980",7268943,7271138,"So, in that case...","Ikiru"
"981",7272680,7278846,"It's exactly what I told you before.Whatever anyone may say,","Ikiru"
"982",7279053,7280452,"Watanabe-san built it...","Ikiru"
"983",7280621,7286150,"But if the City Council and deputymayor hadn't been facing an election,","Ikiru"
"984",7286360,7288658,"they'd have ditched the proposal.","Ikiru"
"985",7288863,7293163,"Watanabe-san had nothing to dowith the crucial decisions.","Ikiru"
"986",7293367,7295801,"No, that's not actually true.","Ikiru"
"987",7295970,7297267,"- Oh, really?- Really.","Ikiru"
"988",7297505,7300599,"The folks who wantedthat restaurant row","Ikiru"
"989",7300841,7304902,"hated having Watanabein their way. The thing is...","Ikiru"
"990",7322062,7323427,"Section Chief.","Ikiru"
"991",7324932,7328891,"- Hey, you Section Chief of Public Affairs?- Yes.","Ikiru"
"992",7334108,7336372,"Just the man I wanted to see.","Ikiru"
"993",7338579,7342071,"Old man, you keep your fat trap shut.","Ikiru"
"994",7342450,7345613,"What on earth are you trying to...","Ikiru"
"995",7345820,7347549,"Don't fuck with me.","Ikiru"
"996",7352092,7356620,"No hard feelings.Just shut up and back down.","Ikiru"
"997",7357798,7360426,"Hey, say something.","Ikiru"
"998",7361669,7363136,"You're risking your life.","Ikiru"
"999",7383257,7385782,"This is him, Watanabe.","Ikiru"
"1000",7463837,7465828,"I just don't get it.","Ikiru"
"1001",7466674,7470633,"Why would anyone like him just...","Ikiru"
"1002",7470911,7473277,"I just don't...","Ikiru"
"1003",7484725,7489025,"No. Watanabe-san knewhe had stomach cancer. I'm positive.","Ikiru"
"1004",7489229,7490560,"But...","Ikiru"
"1005",7491999,7496163,"I just suddenly remembered...","Ikiru"
"1006",7510384,7512716,"This is just inexcusable.","Ikiru"
"1007",7512920,7514979,"We've been at this for two weeks.","Ikiru"
"1008",7515155,7519854,"At least they could tell uswhether or not the funds are there.","Ikiru"
"1009",7520060,7521925,"Administration's just cruel.","Ikiru"
"1010",7522129,7526225,"They'll allocate the funds anyway.It's not their personal money.","Ikiru"
"1011",7526500,7528365,"Now, now, there.","Ikiru"
"1012",7528569,7533336,"But doesn't it make you furiouswhen they walk all over you this way?","Ikiru"
"1013",7535476,7536476,"No.","Ikiru"
"1014",7537478,7540606,"I can't afford to hate people.","Ikiru"
"1015",7542783,7545911,"I haven't got that kind of time.","Ikiru"
"1016",7562603,7563469,"Meaning...","Ikiru"
"1017",7563470,7567566,"Say. Speaking of that...","Ikiru"
"1018",7567841,7573245,"I've got another one like that.","Ikiru"
"1019",7588796,7591526,"How beautiful.","Ikiru"
"1020",7599707,7602107,"How truly beautiful.","Ikiru"
"1021",7604678,7610139,"In the last 30 years,I'd all but forgotten about sunsets.","Ikiru"
"1022",7617825,7621124,"But I haven't got time for this now.","Ikiru"
"1023",7626800,7627800,"Thought so.","Ikiru"
"1024",7627801,7628568,"Now I see.","Ikiru"
"1025",7628569,7631766,"Knowing he didn't havelong left to live...","Ikiru"
"1026",7631939,7635102,"It makes everything clear as day.","Ikiru"
"1027",7635275,7636970,"Otherwise, it makes no...","Ikiru"
"1028",7637177,7642809,"Well, that explains his extraordinarypassion and his outrageous behavior.","Ikiru"
"1029",7643484,7645247,"How else could he have been?","Ikiru"
"1030",7645486,7647647,"Absolutely.We'd have done the same.","Ikiru"
"1031",7652726,7655820,"But any one of uscould suddenly drop dead.","Ikiru"
"1032",7669409,7670808,"Listen here.","Ikiru"
"1033",7671879,7675610,"Hey, Section Chief.","Ikiru"
"1034",7678852,7684757,"I mean you, the newly appointedPublic Affairs Section Chief.","Ikiru"
"1035",7689129,7692155,"Don't you hear me?","Ikiru"
"1036",7693367,7696803,"I haven't been promoted yet.","Ikiru"
"1037",7704912,7706140,"Hey!","Ikiru"
"1038",7707181,7709445,"Ohno!- Cut it out.","Ikiru"
"1039",7709883,7713478,"What the hell did you just say?","Ikiru"
"1040",7714188,7718124,"""We would've done it, too?""","Ikiru"
"1041",7719993,7723895,"Don't make me laugh.- Hey, cut it out.","Ikiru"
"1042",7724131,7728659,"You couldn't have donewhat Watanabe-san did.","Ikiru"
"1043",7730070,7732766,"Make me laugh.","Ikiru"
"1044",7733340,7736138,"Say, Ohara-san...","Ikiru"
"1045",7737511,7739911,"The thing is...","Ikiru"
"1046",7742349,7744681,"I may look like this...","Ikiru"
"1047",7747054,7751252,"- I only graduated middle school...- Watanabe-san...","Ikiru"
"1048",7751491,7756485,"So I'll never make section chiefin my life...","Ikiru"
"1049",7767507,7771204,"Compared to Watanabe-san,we've all just...","Ikiru"
"1050",7773580,7776140,"We're just worthless scum.","Ikiru"
"1051",7777985,7780681,"Hey, you assholes, too...","Ikiru"
"1052",7780954,7782421,"Why, that's...","Ikiru"
"1053",7786393,7788623,"That's right, we're all scum.","Ikiru"
"1054",7789796,7794426,"But some of us were okaywhen we started out at City Hall.","Ikiru"
"1055",7794868,7799498,"But the longer you stay...Even I didn't used to be like...","Ikiru"
"1056",7802542,7806205,"You're not supposed to doanything there.","Ikiru"
"1057",7806413,7809712,"Doing anything but nothingis radical.","Ikiru"
"1058",7809917,7813512,"We have to act like we'redoing something but do nothing.","Ikiru"
"1059",7813687,7816554,"- That's right.- That's exactly right.","Ikiru"
"1060",7816757,7818782,"The thing is,","Ikiru"
"1061",7818992,7823190,"in order to clean up a garbage cansomewhere,","Ikiru"
"1062",7823430,7827594,"you need a garbage canfull of paperwork.","Ikiru"
"1063",7827801,7829325,"That's exactly right.","Ikiru"
"1064",7831672,7836200,"That's just an excuse.We're robbing people of valuable time.","Ikiru"
"1065",7836443,7840243,"The public's upset by bribesand 40,000 cars and so on,","Ikiru"
"1066",7840447,7845407,"but those are just farts next to thisinvisible, colossal waste of time.","Ikiru"
"1067",7849389,7851220,"Now you listen here.","Ikiru"
"1068",7851458,7853949,"I worry about these things, too.","Ikiru"
"1069",7854161,7858495,"But the thing is, inside thatcomplex system, it's impossible.","Ikiru"
"1070",7858699,7861668,"Besides, there's never timeto think in there.","Ikiru"
"1071",7861969,7863095,"Idiots!","Ikiru"
"1072",7872479,7875710,"No, but the thing is,","Ikiru"
"1073",7875916,7877349,"Ohara-san,","Ikiru"
"1074",7877584,7883079,"even within a systemwhere you can't get a thing done,","Ikiru"
"1075",7883523,7886390,"and battling stomach cancer at that,","Ikiru"
"1076",7886593,7890393,"Watanabe-san managedto accomplish so much.","Ikiru"
"1077",7892032,7895126,"That's it.That's what I'm trying to say.","Ikiru"
"1078",7895369,7898031,"That's why I get so angry.","Ikiru"
"1079",7898238,7899432,"That's what I'm saying.","Ikiru"
"1080",7899639,7903370,"That Watanabe-san,with no expectations...","Ikiru"
"1081",7903577,7909345,"Exactly. When you rememberhow Watanabe-san staked his life...","Ikiru"
"1082",7909516,7911780,"Who dares claim his achievements!","Ikiru"
"1083",7911985,7914146,"The deputy mayor.Spit it out!","Ikiru"
"1084",7918325,7921123,"That's going too far.","Ikiru"
"1085",7929669,7931034,"Listen.","Ikiru"
"1086",7931538,7936737,"How do you think he felt","Ikiru"
"1087",7938278,7941076,"dying all alone in that park?","Ikiru"
"1088",7941815,7944375,"Just thinking about it...","Ikiru"
"1089",7966606,7971373,"A policeman brought this.He said he'd found it in the park.","Ikiru"
"1090",7978452,7981979,"And he really wantsto light incense for the deceased.","Ikiru"
"1091",8000740,8004107,"Thank you for taking the trouble.Come in.","Ikiru"

"1086",4650732,4652234,"He volunteered.","Presumed Innocent"
"1087",4652317,4653610,"And I accepted.","Presumed Innocent"
"1088",4654027,4656530,"He promised to pursue it vigorously.","Presumed Innocent"
"1089",4656738,4657864,"Did he?","Presumed Innocent"
"1090",4657989,4660158,"Not to my way of thinking, no.","Presumed Innocent"
"1091",4661159,4663995,"I got the feeling he was stallingon the investigation.","Presumed Innocent"
"1092",4664079,4666998,"I let him know that I wasn't happyabout that.","Presumed Innocent"
"1093",4669376,4672587,"He brought in his own detectiveto replace Harold Greer.","Presumed Innocent"
"1094",4672796,4676299,"Then he gave his new partner instructionsto ignore evidence...","Presumed Innocent"
"1095",4676383,4679678,"...about telephone callsbetween his house and Carolyn's.","Presumed Innocent"
"1096",4681012,4685058,"He tried to limit the scope ofthe fingerprint search to exclude his own.","Presumed Innocent"
"1097",4687477,4691857,"He was more interested in whether I hadbeen intimate with Carolyn Polhemus...","Presumed Innocent"
"1098",4692107,4694359,"...than in the facts surrounding her murder.","Presumed Innocent"
"1099",4694442,4697028,"What did you tell himabout you and Ms. Polhemus?","Presumed Innocent"
"1100",4697112,4698697,"I told him the truth.","Presumed Innocent"
"1101",4699406,4701658,"That we'd been togetherfor about three months.","Presumed Innocent"
"1102",4701741,4703869,"This, of course, was after I was divorced.","Presumed Innocent"
"1103",4703952,4706121,"At that time, or any other time...","Presumed Innocent"
"1104",4706246,4709082,"...did he inform youof his personal relationship with her?","Presumed Innocent"
"1105",4709166,4713295,"There is no proof in the recordof any relationship between them.","Presumed Innocent"
"1106",4713712,4715714,"I'll let the question stand.","Presumed Innocent"
"1107",4716715,4721136,"But Mr. Della Guardia is asking a questionbased on his assumption...","Presumed Innocent"
"1108",4721761,4726057,"...that something was going onbetween Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus.","Presumed Innocent"
"1109",4726433,4728685,"Just because he thinks it's so...","Presumed Innocent"
"1110",4728935,4730604,"...doesn't make it so.","Presumed Innocent"
"1111",4731396,4732564,"Proceed.","Presumed Innocent"
"1112",4733356,4735901,"I never would've let him handlethe investigation...","Presumed Innocent"
"1113",4735984,4738987,"...if I thought he'd been intimatewith the victim.","Presumed Innocent"
"1114",4739446,4741114,"Nothing further.","Presumed Innocent"
"1115",4741740,4743283,"Have you any...","Presumed Innocent"
"1116",4743575,4745494,"...personal knowledge...","Presumed Innocent"
"1117",4745619,4749831,"...that there was ever a relationshipbetween Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus?","Presumed Innocent"
"1118",4750123,4751875,"That's the point. He didn't tell me.","Presumed Innocent"
"1119",4751958,4754336,"Please answer the question I asked you.","Presumed Innocent"
"1120",4755754,4757714,"Do you remember the question?","Presumed Innocent"
"1121",4757923,4758924,"I do.","Presumed Innocent"
"1122",4759466,4761551,"But you chose not to answer it.","Presumed Innocent"
"1123",4762427,4764221,"I apologize, Mr. Stern.","Presumed Innocent"
"1124",4764471,4768266,"I have no personal knowledgethat such a relationship ever existed.","Presumed Innocent"
"1125",4768517,4771144,"Assuming there was somethingto disclose...","Presumed Innocent"
"1126",4771269,4775649,"...you believe he should have informedanyone in a responsible position?","Presumed Innocent"
"1127",4775732,4776525,"I do.","Presumed Innocent"
"1128",4776608,4780111,"Certainly you would give any informationyou had on a case...","Presumed Innocent"
"1129",4780237,4782489,"...to your investigating staff?","Presumed Innocent"
"1130",4782656,4783949,"Certainly.","Presumed Innocent"
"1131",4784825,4786076,"Mr. Horgan...","Presumed Innocent"
"1132",4786535,4789621,"...you removed a file, a so-called B file...","Presumed Innocent"
"1133",4789955,4794167,"...from Ms. Polhemus's office afterthe investigation of her murder began?","Presumed Innocent"
"1134",4794584,4796336,"What's the relevance of this?","Presumed Innocent"
"1135",4796419,4799297,"The witness has testifiedon direct examination...","Presumed Innocent"
"1136",4799381,4803260,"...that Mr. Sabich did not bringto his attention information...","Presumed Innocent"
"1137",4803426,4805011,"...that he regarded as pertinent.","Presumed Innocent"
"1138",4805095,4809724,"The defense is entitled to exploreMr. Horgan's standards in this regard.","Presumed Innocent"
"1139",4810350,4813270,"Subject to a later connection, I'll allow it.","Presumed Innocent"
"1140",4814104,4815605,"Continue, Counselor.","Presumed Innocent"
"1141",4816106,4819025,"And you gave that B file to Mr. Sabich...","Presumed Innocent"
"1142",4819442,4823488,"...only after he informed you it was missingfrom Ms. Polhemus's office?","Presumed Innocent"
"1143",4824322,4825699,"That's true.","Presumed Innocent"
"1144",4826783,4829703,"You've told us that youand Carolyn were lovers.","Presumed Innocent"
"1145",4830287,4831913,"For a short time, yes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1146",4832956,4834499,"B-file cases...","Presumed Innocent"
"1147",4834958,4838044,"...cases involving briberyand official misconduct...","Presumed Innocent"
"1148",4838503,4841715,"...are normally assignedto the assistant deputy.","Presumed Innocent"
"1149",4842132,4844718,"At the time, Mr. Sabich. Is that not true?","Presumed Innocent"
"1150",4844801,4846595,"That was the usual practice, yes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1151",4846678,4850307,"You gave this highly sensitive matterin this B file...","Presumed Innocent"
"1152",4850515,4853518,"...to Carolyn Polhemuswhile you were sleeping with her?","Presumed Innocent"
"1153",4853602,4855729,"That appears to be the time frame.","Presumed Innocent"
"1154",4857939,4860108,"The answer to the question is yes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1155",4861526,4866239,"Weren't you concerned, in the midstof a nip-and-tuck election campaign...","Presumed Innocent"
"1156",4866656,4870076,"...about word leaking outthat you had secretly given a file...","Presumed Innocent"
"1157",4870160,4872537,"...that was in Mr. Sabich's areaof authority...","Presumed Innocent"
"1158",4872621,4875373,"...to an assistant with no experiencein such matters...","Presumed Innocent"
"1159",4875457,4878043,"...with whom you were sleepingat the time?","Presumed Innocent"
"1160",4879169,4881171,"It may have crossed my mind.","Presumed Innocent"
"1161",4882339,4885175,"Who knows? It was not an ideal situation.","Presumed Innocent"
"1162",4886676,4887928,"Far from it.","Presumed Innocent"
"1163",4889721,4890931,"And, sir...","Presumed Innocent"
"1164",4891473,4893475,"...you come to this courtroom...","Presumed Innocent"
"1165",4893558,4895519,"...where the life of a man...","Presumed Innocent"
"1166",4895644,4899815,"...who served you faithfully for 1 2 yearsnow hangs in the balance...","Presumed Innocent"
"1167",4899981,4902692,"...and you tell usyou withheld evidence from him...","Presumed Innocent"
"1168",4902776,4905862,"...that might have assistedin his investigation?","Presumed Innocent"
"1169",4917707,4918834,"All right.","Presumed Innocent"
"1170",4922420,4924047,"Is it fair to say...","Presumed Innocent"
"1171",4924548,4927592,"...that the chief deputy is the personin the office...","Presumed Innocent"
"1172",4927676,4930846,"...in whose judgement you placethe greatest confidence?","Presumed Innocent"
"1173",4932681,4935684,"I regarded him as the best lawyerfor the job, yes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1174",4935809,4938478,"And you gave Mr. Sabich the authority...","Presumed Innocent"
"1175",4938937,4942315,"...to decide when and whereto fire Mr. Della Guardia?","Presumed Innocent"
"1176",4942524,4943900,"Gentlemen...","Presumed Innocent"
"1177",4944484,4946319,"...let's stop right there.","Presumed Innocent"
"1178",4948321,4950824,"What is the relevance of who fired who?","Presumed Innocent"
"1179",4951032,4955370,"Judge, it's our theory that Mr. Sabichis being framed in this case.","Presumed Innocent"
"1180",4956830,4959791,"-I don't believe it.-Your response has been noted.","Presumed Innocent"
"1181",4960041,4963211,"If Mr. Stern is truly going to endeavorto prove...","Presumed Innocent"
"1182",4963336,4966798,"...that the case against Mr. Sabichhas been manufactured...","Presumed Innocent"
"1183",4966923,4970719,"...then this history of antagonismis relevant for those purposes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1184",4970844,4973138,"What about this missing B file?","Presumed Innocent"
"1185",4973221,4976266,"We believe it's being withheldbecause it contains evidence...","Presumed Innocent"
"1186",4976349,4978477,"...that is necessary to the defense.","Presumed Innocent"
"1187",4978560,4981313,"So, we intend to pursue this matter...","Presumed Innocent"
"1188",4981771,4985567,"...until we have a full understandingon how it bears on the truth.","Presumed Innocent"
"1189",4985901,4989654,"I don't know where this will lead us,but I'll tell you two things:","Presumed Innocent"
"1190",4989821,4992616,"You'd better be preparedfor the prosecution's response...","Presumed Innocent"
"1191",4992699,4997120,"...because he is going to be entitledto a great deal of latitude in answering.","Presumed Innocent"
"1192",4997454,4999748,"'Cause I am going to give him that.","Presumed Innocent"
"1193",5004669,5008757,"Do you recall we spoke about a B filethat you assigned to Ms. Polhemus?","Presumed Innocent"
"1194",5009508,5011593,"I'll remember it for quite some time.","Presumed Innocent"
"1195",5011676,5014846,"-Was Mr. Molto involved in this case?-Objection!","Presumed Innocent"
"1196",5014971,5016473,"Objection sustained.","Presumed Innocent"
"1197",5016640,5019267,"Mr. Stern, you're playing with fire.","Presumed Innocent"
"1198",5020894,5024439,"Do you know what investigation, if any,Mr. Molto pursued--","Presumed Innocent"
"1199",5024523,5026566,"I'll answer that! He took no action.","Presumed Innocent"
"1200",5026650,5029110,"He wasn't going to chaseSabich's red herrings.","Presumed Innocent"
"1201",5029194,5032656,"Mr. Della Guardia, you will rememberyou're the prosecutor...","Presumed Innocent"
"1202",5032739,5034324,"...not the witness.","Presumed Innocent"
"1203",5040205,5044459,"Perhaps we can all learn somethingabout red herrings and scapegoats.","Presumed Innocent"
"1204",5045460,5046878,"That is all.","Presumed Innocent"
"1205",5047295,5049881,"This court is adjourned for the weekend.","Presumed Innocent"
"1206",5051466,5053802,"I don't understand what you're doing.","Presumed Innocent"
"1207",5054219,5056221,"You're alienating the judge.","Presumed Innocent"
"1208",5056471,5060559,"When I said they manufactured a case,you wanted nothing to do with it.","Presumed Innocent"
"1209",5060976,5063019,"Clearly, I changed my mind.","Presumed Innocent"
"1210",5063311,5064938,"On the basis of what?","Presumed Innocent"
"1211",5065355,5066565,"Instinct.","Presumed Innocent"
"1212",5070694,5073113,"If you don't like it,you can always come home.","Presumed Innocent"
"1213",5073196,5074489,"I wanna go.","Presumed Innocent"
"1214",5074906,5076867,"All my friends will be there.","Presumed Innocent"
"1215",5077534,5078910,"I'll be okay.","Presumed Innocent"
"1216",5083165,5085041,"Come here. Sit down.","Presumed Innocent"
"1217",5087043,5089880,"Look, I'm accused of doing somethingI didn't do.","Presumed Innocent"
"1218",5090547,5094050,"This trial is gonna give me a chanceto clear myself.","Presumed Innocent"
"1219",5094759,5096970,"-That's what's gonna happen.-Of course.","Presumed Innocent"
"1220",5097053,5098263,"Of course.","Presumed Innocent"
"1221",5099473,5101975,"Here are the postcards. Use them.","Presumed Innocent"
"1222",5102100,5104436,"-Don't forget to write.-They make me.","Presumed Innocent"
"1223",5104936,5106354,"What about me?","Presumed Innocent"
"1224",5117073,5118658,"Did Mr. Sabich ever tell you...","Presumed Innocent"
"1225",5118742,5121828,"...he had a personal relationshipwith Ms. Polhemus?","Presumed Innocent"
"1226",5122370,5123371,"No.","Presumed Innocent"
"1227",5123830,5125499,"Did Mr. Sabich, at any time...","Presumed Innocent"
"1228",5125582,5129419,"...order you not to get phone recordsof calls from his home?","Presumed Innocent"
"1229",5129544,5131963,"He never ordered me. He asked me.","Presumed Innocent"
"1230",5132130,5134716,"He asked you not to get those records?","Presumed Innocent"
"1231",5135050,5136176,"Did you oblige him?","Presumed Innocent"
"1232",5136259,5139387,"I was taken off the casebefore I got to those records.","Presumed Innocent"
"1233",5139513,5142224,"-You did or did not get those records?-I did not.","Presumed Innocent"
"1234",5142307,5145435,"We had a lot of higher-priority itemson our mind.","Presumed Innocent"
"1235",5147187,5148647,"A high-priority item...","Presumed Innocent"
"1236",5148730,5153193,"...was the analysis of fingerprints foundin Ms. Polhemus's apartment.","Presumed Innocent"
"1237",5153485,5155529,"Who talked with the Fingerprint Lab?","Presumed Innocent"
"1238",5155612,5156738,"Mr. Sabich.","Presumed Innocent"
"1239",5156822,5158782,"Did you ask him to expedite the reports?","Presumed Innocent"
"1240",5158865,5159950,"Yes, sir, I did.","Presumed Innocent"
"1241",5160033,5162327,"What did he say, if anything?","Presumed Innocent"
"1242",5162994,5164371,"He said he forgot.","Presumed Innocent"
"1243",5164454,5165789,"He forgot?","Presumed Innocent"
"1244",5169042,5170544,"Rusty forgot.","Presumed Innocent"
"1245",5171628,5174840,"Would it be fair to say the two of you,by working together...","Presumed Innocent"
"1246",5174923,5177259,"...have formed a personal friendship?","Presumed Innocent"
"1247",5177843,5179427,"I suppose so, yes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1248",5179761,5181388,"Were you assigned initially?","Presumed Innocent"
"1249",5181471,5184141,"Harold Greer initially handled the case.","Presumed Innocent"
"1250",5185433,5187686,"Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you...","Presumed Innocent"
"1251",5187769,5190814,"...any reservations aboutHarold Greer's abilities?","Presumed Innocent"
"1252",5191064,5194693,"Everybody that I know thinksof Harold Greer as a top-grade cop.","Presumed Innocent"
"1253",5194943,5199072,"Do you know who decided to replaceHarold Greer and bring you on this case?","Presumed Innocent"
"1254",5199156,5200574,"Mr. Sabich.","Presumed Innocent"
"1255",5202993,5204286,"Do you feel....","Presumed Innocent"
"1256",5204369,5205453,"Withdrawn.","Presumed Innocent"
"1257",5205954,5209875,"To your knowledge, does the defendanthave a closer personal relationship...","Presumed Innocent"
"1258",5209958,5213420,"...with anyone on the police forcethan he does with you?","Presumed Innocent"
"1259",5213962,5215881,"Not that he's mentioned, no.","Presumed Innocent"
"1260",5216381,5218508,"So it's fair to say, Detective...","Presumed Innocent"
"1261",5218592,5223221,"...that you are the police officerleast likely to suspect him of murder.","Presumed Innocent"
"1262",5224097,5226683,"I would never believe that. Never.","Presumed Innocent"
"1263",5227184,5229394,"Thank you for your cooperationand answering...","Presumed Innocent"
"1264",5229478,5232939,"...what must have been painfuland difficult questions for you...","Presumed Innocent"

"1266",5235817,5237152,"Nothing further.","Presumed Innocent"
"1267",5240697,5243533,"You made reference to a theoryyou were developing that...","Presumed Innocent"
"1268",5243617,5246786,"...Ms. Polhemus might have beenthe victim of a revenge killer.","Presumed Innocent"
"1269",5246870,5248705,"Someone she had once sent to jail.","Presumed Innocent"
"1270",5248788,5252375,"Yes, sir. We thought of thatas our most likely case.","Presumed Innocent"
"1271",5252792,5255128,"To identify possible suspects...","Presumed Innocent"
"1272",5255587,5260217,"...you reviewed cases she had prosecuted,and was currently prosecuting...","Presumed Innocent"
"1273",5260383,5262302,"...going back several years? Correct?","Presumed Innocent"
"1274",5262385,5263512,"Yes, sir.","Presumed Innocent"
"1275",5263762,5265847,"Were you able to find all those files?","Presumed Innocent"
"1276",5265931,5267933,"No, sir. A file was missing.","Presumed Innocent"
"1277",5268517,5270894,"This is the so-called B file...","Presumed Innocent"
"1278",5271228,5273730,"...that was withheldfrom you and Mr. Sabich...","Presumed Innocent"
"1279",5273814,5277275,"...until Mr. Sabich requested it personallyfrom Mr. Horgan?","Presumed Innocent"
"1280",5277567,5278610,"Yes, sir.","Presumed Innocent"
"1281",5278693,5280403,"It involved allegations--","Presumed Innocent"

"1283",5282948,5286535,"You've been warned about riding offin all directions.","Presumed Innocent"
"1284",5286785,5288328,"No further questions.","Presumed Innocent"
"1285",5288954,5290789,"No redirect, Your Honor.","Presumed Innocent"
"1286",5291498,5294376,"We need subpoenas for Carolyn's doctors...","Presumed Innocent"
"1287",5294668,5296503,"...and for phone company records...","Presumed Innocent"
"1288",5296586,5298463,"...to check for errors.","Presumed Innocent"
"1289",5298797,5301341,"I don't think we need to bother with that.","Presumed Innocent"
"1290",5302217,5305428,"You said there was something wrongwith the phone records.","Presumed Innocent"
"1291",5305512,5308682,"That you never called Polhemusthe night of the murder.","Presumed Innocent"
"1292",5311309,5314437,"Jamie, I'd like a moment alonewith my client.","Presumed Innocent"
"1293",5317774,5319192,"-Sure.-Thanks.","Presumed Innocent"

"1521",6261259,6265972,"...that your evidence would disappearafter last being seen with Mr. Molto.","Presumed Innocent"
"1522",6266097,6268058,"I didn't know that Mr. Molto...","Presumed Innocent"
"1523",6268141,6271269,"...and the chief pathologistwould manufacture evidence...","Presumed Innocent"
"1524",6271353,6272938,"...and testimony.","Presumed Innocent"
"1525",6273021,6277067,"And I tell you, that is a fair interpretationof the day's events.","Presumed Innocent"
"1526",6277192,6280529,"I'm still considering the questionof what happens to Mr. Molto...","Presumed Innocent"
"1527",6280612,6282280,"...but what isn't gonna happen...","Presumed Innocent"

"1558",6413995,6416581,"...the prosecutors have suspicions.","Presumed Innocent"
"1559",6418291,6420961,"Perhaps Mr. Sabich was there that night.","Presumed Innocent"
"1560",6421461,6423672,"The State might be granted that.","Presumed Innocent"
"1561",6423880,6427175,"And if the prosecutorshad ever found that glass...","Presumed Innocent"
"1562",6427801,6429970,"...l might be more convinced.","Presumed Innocent"
"1563",6430303,6432139,"Maybe before yesterday...","Presumed Innocent"
"1564",6432764,6437018,"...l might have said there werereasonable grounds for those suspicions.","Presumed Innocent"
"1565",6437185,6439271,"But now, I'm not so sure.","Presumed Innocent"
"1566",6442315,6444151,"So after yesterday...","Presumed Innocent"

"1597",6566356,6568567,"With just cause, wouldn't you say?","Presumed Innocent"
"1598",6569025,6572612,"You knew that file didn't havea damn thing to do with my case.","Presumed Innocent"
"1599",6573029,6576741,"Yet you let Larren know you'd drag it inat any opportunity.","Presumed Innocent"
"1600",6577033,6579494,"That it would come outthat he was taking bribes.","Presumed Innocent"
"1601",6579578,6581705,"That Carolyn was the courier.","Presumed Innocent"
"1602",6584541,6586376,"You blackmailed him, Sandy.","Presumed Innocent"

"1605",6599055,6600098,"Agreed?","Presumed Innocent"
"1606",6604227,6607230,"Larren's divorce left himin a state of disorder.","Presumed Innocent"
"1607",6608231,6613111,"He was drinking too heavily and fellinto a relationship with a beautiful, but...","Presumed Innocent"
"1608",6613403,6615071,"...self-serving woman.","Presumed Innocent"

"1611",6622120,6624581,"He wanted to resign from the bench.","Presumed Innocent"

"1615",6634257,6637594,"Raymond cleaned up the Northside,as you recall...","Presumed Innocent"

"1631",6726141,6728894,"The idea was that I'll put it back in.","Presumed Innocent"
"1632",6729644,6732022,"Only I got nowhere to put it...","Presumed Innocent"
"1633",6732564,6735317,"...since it ain't my goddamn case anymore.","Presumed Innocent"
"1634",6737152,6739404,"So I tossed the thing in my drawer.","Presumed Innocent"
"1635",6740071,6743158,"I figured, sooner or latersomebody's got to ask me.","Presumed Innocent"
"1636",6744576,6745827,"Nobody did.","Presumed Innocent"

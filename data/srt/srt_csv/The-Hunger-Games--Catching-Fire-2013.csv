"62",427136,431641,"A problem that began the moment yourevealed those poison berries in the arena.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"63",431723,435853,"If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane,had had any brains at all,","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"75",465550,468427,"I mean, you can't know this,but in several of them,","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"76",468511,472848,"people viewed your little trickwith the berries as an act of defiance.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"77",473223,475100,"Not as an act of love.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"78",475183,481189,"And if a girl from District 12 of all places candefy The Capitol and walk away unharmed,","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"79",481274,483567,"what is to prevent themfrom doing the same?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"80",483651,487654,"What is to prevent, say, an uprising?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"81",488029,490699,"That can lead to revolution.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"82",491033,493995,"And then, in a fraction of time,the whole system collapses.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"83",494245,498124,"It must be a fragile system, if it can bebrought down by just a few berries.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"84",498206,499875,"Yes, it is, indeed.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"85",500625,502545,"But not in the way you imagine it.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"86",502627,504129,"How should I imagine?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"87",504213,507341,"You should imagine thousandsupon thousands of your people dead.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"88",507716,510302,"This town of yours reduced to ashes.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"89",510386,511470,"Imagine it gone.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"91",512763,516517,"Buried under dirt as if it had never existed,like District 13.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"92",519562,522440,"You fought very hard in The Games,Miss Everdeen.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"93",523732,525567,"But they were games.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"101",543586,549133,"At what point did he realizethe depth of your indifference towards him?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"102",549591,550717,"I'm not indifferent.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"103",550801,552094,"Don't lie!","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"104",552470,553678,"You promised.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"105",557182,559434,"Why don't you just kill me now?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"106",563105,564815,"I don't want to kill you.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"107",565982,567943,"I want us to be friends.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"108",568277,570321,"But if not friends, then allies.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"109",570528,571697,"What do I need to do?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"110",571780,577620,"When you and Peeta are on tour,you need to smile. You need to be grateful.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"111",578495,583125,"But, above all, you need to be madly,prepared-to-end-it-all in love.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"112",583209,585293,"- You think you can manage that?- Yes.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"113",585378,586461,"Yes, what?","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"114",587171,589130,"- I'll convince them.- No.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"115",589966,591299,"Convince me.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"183",836921,839255,"But it's mostly parties, celebrations,","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"184",839340,842467,"adoring fans to greet youat every stop along the way,","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"197",897855,898856,"Including me.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"198",900442,904404,"I know it's not fair of me to hold youto things you said in The Games.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"199",905364,908533,"You saved us. I know that.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"200",910326,915249,"But I can't go on acting for the cameras,and then just ignoring each other in real life.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"201",915957,920837,"So if you can stop looking at me likeI'm wounded, then I can quit acting like it.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"202",922005,926092,"And then maybewe have a shot at being friends.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"203",926342,928302,"I've never been very good at friends.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"208",941482,942900,"It's like I said, I'm...","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"209",942985,944570,"See, Katniss, the waythe whole friend thing works","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"450",1934099,1936810,"She just wants to save her own skin.It's as simple as that.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"451",1936978,1938479,"I think that's true.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"452",1938730,1941481,"But she's becomea beacon of hope for the rebellion.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"453",1942232,1943984,"And she has to be eliminated.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"499",2075907,2077827,"since the Reaping, is how afraid I am.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"500",2077909,2079579,"There's no room for anything else.","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"
"501",2080413,2082081,"But maybe, if we got away from here,","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"

"264",906543,909746,"Bin Laden might be the brains,but make no mistake about it,","12 Strong"
"265",909749,913182,"in Afghanistan,the Taliban is the muscle.","12 Strong"
"266",913183,915684,"If we remove themfrom power,","12 Strong"
"267",915687,917953,"he can't use themto make his attacks.","12 Strong"
"268",917956,919822,"Mazar-i-Sharif.","12 Strong"
"269",919825,922493,"Whoever controls that city,controls Afghanistan.","12 Strong"
"270",922495,924760,"If we take Mazarfrom the Taliban,","12 Strong"
"271",924763,927397,"then we cripple Bin Laden.","12 Strong"
"272",927399,929698,"Well, that's half-right.","12 Strong"
"273",929701,931033,"If you're gonna interrupt me,","12 Strong"

"280",946585,948518,"he does not carefor the Taliban.","12 Strong"
"281",948519,950322,"So this is about airstrikes?","12 Strong"
"282",951322,953054,"Sorry, sir.","12 Strong"
"283",953057,954556,"No, you nailed that one.","12 Strong"
"284",954557,957126,"Dostum cannot take outthe Taliban by himself.","12 Strong"
"285",957129,958561,"Here's the plan.","12 Strong"
"286",958562,960729,"We're gonna drop you intoNorthern Afghanistan.","12 Strong"
"287",960730,963299,"There, you will meet upwith a CIA operative","12 Strong"

"291",969072,970873,"embed with his militia,","12 Strong"
"292",970875,973910,"you fight alongside him while he makeshis way to Taliban strongholds.","12 Strong"
"293",973913,977379,"When you get there, you call infor close air support strikes.","12 Strong"
"294",977380,978713,"Dostum will do the rest.","12 Strong"
"295",978716,981183,"One by one,stronghold by stronghold,","12 Strong"
"296",981186,984220,"until he takes Mazar,and the Taliban falls.","12 Strong"
"297",984221,986388,"You got six weeks.","12 Strong"
"298",986389,988291,"I'd say three weeks, sir.","12 Strong"
"299",988293,990759,"- God damn it.- No, no.","12 Strong"
"300",990760,993061,"All right, I'll bite.","12 Strong"
"301",993062,994797,"Why three?","12 Strong"
"302",994798,997032,"The Russians have been here before, right?They've done this.","12 Strong"
"303",997033,998400,"And they wrote about it.","12 Strong"
"304",998403,999969,"They said the snowwas shutting down","12 Strong"
"305",999971,1002772,"all the mountain passesby mid-November.","12 Strong"
"306",1002774,1004740,"Every year, without fail.","12 Strong"
"307",1004743,1006542,"Now, if the Russians aretalking about a bad winter,","12 Strong"
"308",1006543,1008677,"it's usually worthpaying attention to, isn't it?","12 Strong"
"309",1008678,1011213,"After three weeks,we will not get into Mazar.","12 Strong"
"310",1011216,1015650,"That snow will hit, the Taliban willdig in, and my men won't come home.","12 Strong"
"311",1015653,1018421,"Your air support comesfrom B-52s at 35,000 feet.","12 Strong"
"312",1018423,1020756,"How do you think you're gonnaget close enough to be accurate","12 Strong"
"313",1020759,1022191,"without parking a bombin your lap?","12 Strong"
"314",1022192,1023692,"I'll have to getout of the way, sir.","12 Strong"
"315",1025262,1027462,"The extra three weeksis cushion for your fuck-ups.","12 Strong"
"316",1027464,1029365,"There won't be any fuck-ups.Three weeks is all we need.","12 Strong"
"317",1029366,1032536,"Pretty confident for a guywho's never done this before.","12 Strong"
"318",1032538,1033969,"Never been to war.","12 Strong"
"319",1033971,1036739,"I don't see thatas a disadvantage, sir.","12 Strong"
"320",1036740,1038708,"Well, maybe you shouldexplain that.","12 Strong"
"321",1038710,1041811,"We're teaming up with a warlordthat we know nothing about.","12 Strong"
"322",1041814,1044212,"We're not gonna be able to tellour enemies from our allies.","12 Strong"
"323",1044214,1048316,"Every step we take is gonna be on aminefield from a hundred different wars.","12 Strong"
"324",1048317,1051353,"And no one's ever called in asmart bomb airstrike from a B-52.","12 Strong"
"325",1051355,1053723,"So anyone who tells youthey've done this before","12 Strong"
"326",1053726,1055791,"or has experience in thisis lying, sir.","12 Strong"
"327",1055794,1059296,"There's no playbook here. We'regonna have to write it ourselves.","12 Strong"

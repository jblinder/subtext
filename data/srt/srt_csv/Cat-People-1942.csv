"561",3297952,3300502,"You disappoint me, Miss Moore.","Cat People"
"562",3302323,3304450,"Here is my robe.","Cat People"
"563",3308730,3311132,"To understand this,I should first have to hear...","Cat People"

"568",3322944,3326147,"Dr. Judd, I know you don't believe me,but you must be careful.","Cat People"
"569",3326247,3328850,"Oh, you want me to carrysome means of protection.","Cat People"
"570",3328950,3332454,"A gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet.Is that what you mean?","Cat People"
"571",3332554,3335614,"If you are lucky enough to have one.","Cat People"
"572",3336224,3338224,"Of course...","Cat People"

"580",3366287,3369524,"Do you sincerely believe thatif your husband were to kiss you...","Cat People"
"581",3369624,3372894,"...you would change into a catand rend him to bits?","Cat People"
"582",3372994,3375895,"I don't know. I am only afraid.","Cat People"
"583",3377866,3380129,"And if I were to kiss you?","Cat People"
"584",3381269,3385859,"I only know that I should not liketo be kissed by you.","Cat People"
"585",3388743,3391346,"My dear Mrs. Reed,sometimes in my profession...","Cat People"
"586",3391446,3395382,"...there comes a contest of willsbetween the doctor and his patient.","Cat People"
"587",3395482,3398679,"Patients are clever. Very clever.","Cat People"
"588",3398853,3402168,"And they can fool the doctor sometimes.","Cat People"
"589",3405193,3406694,"You are very clever.","Cat People"
"590",3406794,3410098,"And perhaps you enjoy this little gameyou are having with me.","Cat People"
"591",3410198,3412800,"But I shall discover your secret.","Cat People"
"592",3412900,3416237,"Dr. Judd, believe me.I beg you to believe me.","Cat People"
"593",3416337,3421041,"I have no secret. I told you everything.I have not lied to you.","Cat People"

"595",3423878,3425878,"I can't help you.","Cat People"
"596",3427015,3429040,"But I can warn you.","Cat People"
"597",3429217,3431853,"These hallucinations approach insanity.","Cat People"
"598",3431953,3435990,"This nonsense about Miss Mooreat the park and in the swimming pool...","Cat People"
"599",3436090,3439861,"...it's a deterioration of the mind,escape into fantasy.","Cat People"
"600",3439961,3441961,"And it's dangerous.","Cat People"
"601",3442930,3444666,"At this moment...","Cat People"
"602",3444766,3448837,"...I could go before a boardand have you put away for observation.","Cat People"
"603",3448937,3451997,"You are that close to real insanity.","Cat People"
"604",3456644,3458413,"I can't help you.","Cat People"
"605",3458513,3460415,"You can only help yourself.","Cat People"

"610",3473494,3476197,"You know, for the first timeyou've really helped me.","Cat People"
"611",3476297,3479272,"Maybe it's because you interest me.","Cat People"
"612",3502890,3504526,"Oliver.","Cat People"
"613",3504626,3507431,"I went back to Dr. Judd's office.","Cat People"

"615",3510864,3513902,"Believe me, Irena, I'd have beenthe happiest man in the world...","Cat People"
"616",3514002,3516337,"...if you told me that a little while ago.","Cat People"
"617",3516437,3518530,"But things have changed.","Cat People"
"618",3519873,3523845,"I had to learn, maybe throughthis marriage of ours.","Cat People"
"619",3523945,3526413,"I didn't want to tell you this...","Cat People"
"620",3526513,3529175,"...but now, you see, I have to.","Cat People"

"622",3532152,3534152,"Irena, it's too late.","Cat People"
"623",3534322,3536322,"Too late.","Cat People"
"624",3537524,3540862,"Well, there seems only one decent thingfor me to do.","Cat People"
"625",3540962,3543191,"I'll give you a divorce.","Cat People"
"626",3543998,3547268,"Believe me, it's better this way.- Better?","Cat People"
"627",3547368,3550804,"Better for whom?- Irena, I...","Cat People"
"628",3550972,3552972,"Speak.","Cat People"
"629",3552974,3554974,"You can't speak.","Cat People"
"630",3555143,3557523,"There's nothing you can say.","Cat People"
"631",3558713,3560977,"There's only silence.","Cat People"
"632",3565853,3568015,"But I love silence.","Cat People"

"635",3573027,3575656,"Their strength, warmth.","Cat People"
"636",3575829,3578957,"They're soft. They're soft.","Cat People"
"637",3579133,3583808,"Irena, you're talking like an insane woman.- Please go.","Cat People"
"638",3584072,3586403,"I want you to go, please.","Cat People"
"639",3586875,3588875,"Go.","Cat People"

"641",3615670,3617695,"Bavarian cream?","Cat People"
"642",3620974,3622974,"Roquefort?","Cat People"
"643",3624711,3627146,"And you get the apple pie.","Cat People"
"644",3628015,3631219,"I have pointed outtwo alternatives, Mr. Reed:","Cat People"
"645",3631319,3633988,"Either have her put awayfor observation and restraint...","Cat People"
"646",3634088,3636024,"...or have your marriage annulled.","Cat People"
"647",3636124,3638726,"It's tough for Oliver either way, doctor.","Cat People"
"648",3638826,3642262,"As a psychiatrist, I should recommendthat you have her put away.","Cat People"
"649",3642362,3645699,"As your friend, however, I havemuch more reasonable advice to offer.","Cat People"
"650",3645799,3648036,"I think you should haveyour marriage annulled.","Cat People"
"651",3648136,3650772,"In that way, you are free of responsibility.","Cat People"
"652",3650872,3654074,"You two could marry.- And if Irena's sent away?","Cat People"
"653",3654174,3657745,"The law is quite explicit.One cannot divorce an insane person.","Cat People"
"654",3657845,3660315,"If she's not well,I've got to take care of her.","Cat People"
"655",3660415,3662050,"It's the only right thing, Ollie.","Cat People"
"656",3662150,3664818,"As you will. I'll havethe commitment papers drawn up...","Cat People"
"657",3664918,3668122,"...and arrange an interviewwith Mrs. Reed at her apartment tonight.","Cat People"
"658",3668222,3670222,"Shall we say 6:00?","Cat People"
"659",3687909,3689909,"Let's not play that.","Cat People"
"660",3690812,3695049,"I don't think Irena's coming.We've waited an hour and a half.","Cat People"
"661",3695149,3697614,"Perhaps it's useless to wait.","Cat People"
"662",3698520,3701325,"I don't think she intends coming.","Cat People"
"663",3701356,3704331,"She's probably walking in the park.","Cat People"
"664",3708930,3711965,"Ollie, let's get back to the office.We've had a broken-up day...","Cat People"
"665",3712065,3716315,"...and there's lots of work to be done.- Suits me.","Cat People"
"666",3737692,3740461,"How stupid of me, I leftmy walking stick in the apartment.","Cat People"
"667",3740561,3742497,"I'll get it for you.- No, it's my fault.","Cat People"

"731",4887770,4889440,"Just don't fly away, all right?","Superman"
"732",4890520,4893480,"Sorry to drop in on you like this, but I've been thinking.","Superman"
"733",4893770,4897160,"There must be some questions people'd like to know the answers to.","Superman"

"738",4917840,4919430,"Would you like a glass of wine?","Superman"

"747",4943450,4945030,"Do you have a girlfriend?","Superman"
"748",4945120,4946410,"No, I don't. But...","Superman"
"749",4947200,4949540,"If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.","Superman"
"750",4955790,4956840,"How old are you?","Superman"
"751",4957340,4958260,"Over 21.","Superman"
"752",4958960,4961330,"I get it. You don't want anyone to know.","Superman"
"753",4961880,4964260,"And how big are you? How tall are you?","Superman"
"754",4964600,4965680,"About 6' 4''.","Superman"
"755",4965930,4969020,"6' 4''. And how much do you weigh?","Superman"

"757",4971810,4973690,"225?","Superman"
"758",4978380,4980350,"Well, ah...","Superman"

"760",4983910,4987620,"...the rest of your bodily functions are normal?","Superman"
"761",4988700,4989870,"I beg your pardon?","Superman"
"762",4991040,4992870,"Well, putting it delicately...","Superman"

"765",5003470,5006260,"Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.","Superman"
"766",5007100,5009640,"You do. Of course, you do.","Superman"
"767",5010520,5011210,"Well, then is it true...","Superman"
"768",5011410,5017730,"...that you can see through anything?","Superman"
"769",5017980,5019730,"Yes, I can, pretty much.","Superman"
"770",5020690,5023220,"And that you're totally impervious to pain?","Superman"
"771",5023420,5026390,"Well, so far.","Superman"
"772",5026430,5031390,"What color underwear am I wearing?","Superman"
"773",5033710,5035000,"I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you?","Superman"
"774",5035170,5036540,"- No. - I did.","Superman"
"775",5036960,5040410,"No, it's just that this planter must be made of lead.","Superman"
"776",5040750,5041920,"Yes, it is. So?","Superman"
"777",5042010,5045250,"I sort of have a problem seeing through lead.","Superman"
"778",5045450,5047250,"That's interesting.","Superman"
"779",5047450,5050420,"Problems with lead.","Superman"
"780",5051020,5053250,"- Do you have a first name? - Like Ralph, or something?","Superman"
"781",5053450,5055730,"- No, I mean like... - Pink.","Superman"
"782",5056460,5060420,"Pink!","Superman"
"783",5060460,5063320,"Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.","Superman"
"784",5064990,5066360,"You didn't embarrass me.","Superman"
"785",5067470,5071430,"What's your background? Where are you from?","Superman"
"786",5072120,5073270,"It's kind of hard to explain, actually.","Superman"
"787",5073470,5077580,"You see, I'm from... Well, from pretty far away.","Superman"
"788",5078210,5082450,"Another galaxy, as a matter of fact. I come from a planet called Krypton.","Superman"
"789",5083010,5084050,"Krypton.","Superman"
"790",5085470,5088760,"Cripton! With a C-r-i...","Superman"
"791",5090010,5093460,"No, actually it's Krypton, with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n.","Superman"
"792",5093490,5098810,"Do you like pink?","Superman"
"793",5104030,5105530,"I like pink very much.","Superman"
"794",5110160,5111160,"Why are you?","Superman"
"795",5111740,5112580,"Sorry?","Superman"
"796",5113290,5116830,"I mean, why are you here? There must be a reason for you to be here.","Superman"
"797",5117210,5121490,"Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice and the American way.","Superman"
"798",5122090,5124330,"You'll end up fighting every official in this country.","Superman"
"799",5124530,5126330,"You don't really mean that.","Superman"
"800",5126530,5129500,"- I don't believe this. - Lois?","Superman"
"801",5130220,5131260,"I never lie.","Superman"
"802",5139540,5142510,"How fast do you fly, by the way?","Superman"
"803",5142900,5145350,"I don't know. I've never actually bothered to time myself.","Superman"
"804",5145550,5149510,"Say?","Superman"
"805",5149860,5151200,"Why don't we find out?","Superman"
"806",5151780,5153350,"And how do you propose we do that?","Superman"
"807",5153550,5156360,"- Take a ride with me. - You mean I could fly?","Superman"
"808",5156560,5158360,"I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.","Superman"
"809",5158560,5163530,"- This is utterly fantastic. - Wait a minute. Where are you going?","Superman"
"810",5163750,5165630,"- Are you serious? - Sure.","Superman"
"811",5166340,5167370,"Don't you want to go?","Superman"
"812",5167570,5170630,"You won't need these.","Superman"
"813",5170760,5177530,"- I need a sweater. It must be kind of... - No, you'll be warm enough.","Superman"
"814",5180890,5181730,"Ready?","Superman"
"815",5182100,5186690,"Clark said that you were just a figment of somebody's imagination.","Superman"
"816",5187860,5188390,"Like Peter Pan.","Superman"
"817",5188590,5191390,"Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?","Superman"
"818",5191590,5195870,"- Clark? No, he's nothing. - Peter Pan?","Superman"
"819",5198370,5205560,"Peter Pan flew with children, Lois. In a fairy tale.","Superman"
"820",5398700,5400110,"Can you read my mind?","Superman"
"821",5405790,5408000,"Do you know what it is that you do to me?","Superman"
"822",5411380,5412880,"I don't know who you are.","Superman"
"823",5417820,5422780,"Just a friend from another star.","Superman"
"824",5425430,5427640,"Here I am, like a kid out of school.","Superman"
"825",5429600,5431230,"Holding hands with a god.","Superman"
"826",5433270,5434270,"I'm a fool.","Superman"
"827",5436400,5437650,"Will you look at me?","Superman"
"828",5438280,5439190,"Quivering.","Superman"
"829",5440320,5442160,"Like a little girl shivering.","Superman"
"830",5443570,5445450,"You can see right through me.","Superman"
"831",5449850,5454810,"Can you read my mind?","Superman"
"832",5456130,5458420,"Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?","Superman"
"833",5463260,5465100,"Wondering why you are...","Superman"
"834",5466970,5469600,"... all the wonderful things you are.","Superman"
"835",5472520,5473730,"You can fly.","Superman"
"836",5475310,5476860,"You belong in the sky.","Superman"
"837",5479150,5480110,"You and I...","Superman"
"838",5482110,5483780,"... could belong to each other.","Superman"
"839",5487280,5488700,"If you need a friend...","Superman"
"840",5492330,5494250,"... l'm the one to fly to.","Superman"
"841",5497900,5501860,"If you need to be loved...","Superman"
"842",5502630,5503630,"... here I am.","Superman"
"843",5505470,5506720,"Read my mind.","Superman"
"844",5529080,5530700,"We forgot to time ourselves.","Superman"
"845",5531930,5536890,"Maybe next time.","Superman"
"846",5544090,5544970,"You okay?","Superman"
"847",5547950,5550920,"Good night.","Superman"
"848",5551350,5552270,"Good night.","Superman"
"849",5558020,5559150,"What a super man!","Superman"

"854",5574980,5579940,"Lois.","Superman"
"855",5582500,5584380,"- Hi. Can I come in? - Oh, yeah.","Superman"
"856",5584990,5589350,"For goodness' sake, didn't you hear me knocking?","Superman"
"857",5590100,5594960,"We did have a date tonight, remember?","Superman"
"858",5595000,5597800,"You haven't been...?","Superman"
"859",5598000,5603970,"I should certainly hope not. Well, let's push off, shall we?","Superman"
"860",5604650,5607240,"I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.","Superman"
"861",5607450,5609810,"I mean, I need a purse, and I have to fix my hair...","Superman"
"862",5610010,5614970,"...put some blush on.","Superman"
"863",5630030,5632000,"Lois.","Superman"
"864",5632680,5637990,"There's something I have to tell you. I'm really...","Superman"
"865",5638520,5642270,"I was at first really nervous about tonight.","Superman"
"866",5643730,5646850,"But then I decided, darn it, I was going to show you the time of your life.","Superman"
"867",5647050,5652010,"That's Clark nice.","Superman"
"868",5652200,5655020,"We could go for a hamburger or whatever you want to do.","Superman"
"869",5661060,5664030,"Now then...","Superman"
"870",5664630,5667760,"...given the exact location of the galaxy that he mentions...","Superman"
"871",5668340,5671390,"...and the proximity to our own solar system...","Superman"
"872",5674140,5677730,"It's amazing. Amazing!","Superman"
"873",5677930,5679060,"Too good to be true.","Superman"
"874",5679140,5682400,"It's too good to be true. 6' 4"", black hair, blue eyes...","Superman"

"876",5684080,5685030,"Miss Teschmacher.","Superman"
"877",5685230,5688050,"Some people can read War and Peace...","Superman"
"878",5688360,5689890,"...and think it was an adventure story.","Superman"
"879",5690090,5692890,"Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper...","Superman"
"880",5693090,5697050,"...and unlock the secrets of the universe.","Superman"
"881",5697700,5704060,"Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe?","Superman"

"891",5729820,5731240,"I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"892",5732860,5736160,"In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton...","Superman"
"893",5737140,5740110,"...exploded in 1948.","Superman"
"894",5740660,5742460,"That ridiculous little freak...","Superman"
"895",5742920,5745380,"...took three years in a rocket to get to earth.","Superman"
"896",5746130,5747750,"- Ergo... - Ergo.","Superman"

"899",5752150,5758120,"Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me?","Superman"
"900",5758560,5758960,"It's your weight and my I.Q.","Superman"
"901",5759160,5762130,"Think, people, think.","Superman"
"902",5762160,5767120,"Deductive reasoning. That's the name of the game.","Superman"
"903",5767170,5770140,"Fragments from the Planet Krypton...","Superman"
"904",5770570,5772650,"...exploded and went into outer space.","Superman"
"905",5772820,5774610,"It is reasonable to assume...","Superman"
"906",5774740,5777740,"that some of those particles of debris drifted to Earth.","Superman"
"907",5780660,5781580,"Meteorites!","Superman"
"908",5796200,5800160,"A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?","Superman"
"909",5800930,5803390,"I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but...","Superman"
"910",5803480,5804640,"...so what?","Superman"
"911",5805270,5807940,"So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites.","Superman"
"912",5808860,5809820,"Fair enough.","Superman"
"913",5810770,5813280,"But the level of specific radioactivity...","Superman"
"914",5813360,5816030,"...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton...","Superman"
"915",5816450,5818030,"...this substance is lethal.","Superman"
"916",5818700,5820160,"Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"917",5820580,5822020,"Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...","Superman"
"918",5822220,5824790,"...but this stuff here...","Superman"
"919",5824870,5827040,"...will kill him.","Superman"
"920",5830540,5832500,"Doesn't it give you a kind of...","Superman"
"921",5832590,5836300,"...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me?","Superman"
"922",5837720,5840850,"Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him.","Superman"
"923",5840970,5844220,"He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his.","Superman"
"924",5844430,5848210,"O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see...","Superman"
"925",5848480,5850650,"...nor can Superman, through lead.","Superman"
"926",5852690,5854050,"He can't see through lead?","Superman"

"928",5860260,5863230,"Any questions, class?","Superman"
"929",5863830,5866120,"I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?","Superman"
"930",5866790,5868250,"Looks like a burnoose.","Superman"
"931",5868370,5870540,"It's just a wraparound.","Superman"
"932",5870670,5873070,"Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?","Superman"
"933",5873270,5876510,"Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.","Superman"

"937",5929600,5930640,"Look at this!","Superman"
"938",5931350,5932560,"Looks pretty bad.","Superman"
"939",5936340,5941300,"Take her pulse.","Superman"
"940",5948950,5950660,"Get an ambulance down here.","Superman"
"941",5950750,5954040,"I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to.","Superman"
"942",5954130,5956470,"She's having trouble breathing. What do you think?","Superman"
"943",5956670,5959670,"I suggest a vigorous chest massage.","Superman"
"944",5959760,5962260,"If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.","Superman"
"945",5962340,5963340,"Yes, sir!","Superman"
"946",5964970,5968330,"I won't have my men do anything I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.","Superman"

"948",5970020,5971100,"Gather around.","Superman"
"949",5972940,5974020,"Turn around!","Superman"
"950",6002220,6003220,"Hi.","Superman"
"951",6003970,6004970,"Somebody hurt?","Superman"
"952",6020420,6024390,"I did it, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"953",6024660,6026370,"Miss Teschmacher, I did it.","Superman"
"954",6026990,6028230,"- Just like you told me. - All right, Otis.","Superman"
"955",6028430,6032080,"It isn't that I don't trust you, but...","Superman"
"956",6032430,6035240,"I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?","Superman"
"957",6035440,6040400,"I set the first directional vector...","Superman"
"958",6040750,6042260,"...to 38.","Superman"
"959",6042510,6046390,"The second one to 67. And the third one to 117.","Superman"
"960",6046680,6048220,"What about the fourth one?","Superman"
"961",6048550,6049810,"What fourth one?","Superman"
"962",6050010,6052250,"Wait a minute. The third one to 117?","Superman"
"963",6052450,6057420,"- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor. - Otis!","Superman"
"964",6057460,6062420,"The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7.","Superman"
"965",6063490,6065650,"Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"966",6065990,6067270,"I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.","Superman"
"967",6067470,6070870,"Would you like to see a long arm?","Superman"
"968",6071200,6074660,"Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm?","Superman"
"969",6074750,6075960,"No, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"970",6089490,6095450,"- All right. Get it right. - Yes, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"971",6096100,6099020,"I thought you told me this road would be blocked off?","Superman"
"972",6099100,6103460,"- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you... - I didn't ask him, I asked you.","Superman"
"973",6103690,6105400,"All right. Follow me, men.","Superman"
"974",6107110,6110370,"Back that thing off the road. Back it off the road.","Superman"
"975",6120250,6123170,"You'll have to circle back. I don't have time to argue.","Superman"
"976",6123250,6124920,"It's a heck of a day, isn't it?","Superman"
"977",6130530,6131500,"Route 12.","Superman"
"978",6131530,6135500,"- Route 12? That's back there. - No, sir, it's up there.","Superman"
"979",6137540,6144500,"- Sergeant, we took the wrong road. - I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.","Superman"
"980",6148550,6153510,"Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.","Superman"
"981",6158960,6161080,"This man is a diabetic, you see.","Superman"
"982",6172300,6175380,"As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam...","Superman"
"983",6175580,6178140,"...but what I don't understand...","Superman"
"984",6178230,6181230,"...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met?","Superman"
"985",6181310,6182690,"You don't know his name.","Superman"
"986",6185590,6187390,"At the stupid high price he offered...","Superman"
"987",6187590,6190390,"...for this worthless piece of desert...","Superman"
"988",6190590,6194550,"...I hope it's Custer!","Superman"
"989",6194590,6197400,"Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.","Superman"
"990",6197600,6202570,"Reporting live from the launch site, ground zero.","Superman"
"991",6203170,6205410,"Today marks a historic occasion since...","Superman"
"992",6205610,6208410,"... two XK-101 rockets will be launched simultaneously.","Superman"
"993",6208610,6214310,"One by the Army, and one by the Navy.","Superman"
"994",6214510,6216890,"Hi, everybody. Has anybody seen Lois today?","Superman"
"995",6216970,6219180,"No, but the Chief wants to see you.","Superman"
"996",6219270,6221100,"You're blocking the set, Clark.","Superman"
"997",6221890,6223420,"Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?","Superman"
"998",6223620,6225590,"Good. Great.","Superman"
"999",6226360,6227650,"Excuse me, Mr. White.","Superman"
"1000",6227730,6230430,"You wanted to see me, sir? Have you seen Lois today?","Superman"
"1001",6230630,6233950,"She's out West, looking into a land-fraud deal.","Superman"
"1002",6234280,6236910,"I sent young Olsen with her on his first assignment.","Superman"
"1003",6236990,6240170,"Some unidentified clown is buying thousands of acres...","Superman"
"1004",6240370,6242580,"...of worthless desert at incredible prices.","Superman"
"1005",6242710,6243440,"That doesn't seem to make sense.","Superman"
"1006",6243640,6246450,"The world doesn't make sense. You ought to know that.","Superman"
"1007",6246650,6249800,"Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.","Superman"
"1008",6250170,6254130,"People break into a museum at night, kill two people, and what do they take?","Superman"
"1009",6254220,6256460,"A worthless piece of meteorite. How do you figure that?","Superman"
"1010",6256660,6257620,"Well, frankly...","Superman"
"1011",6257890,6260600,"I've never been able to understand violence.","Superman"
"1012",6261230,6262560,"I know that about you.","Superman"
"1013",6262730,6264650,"That's why I wanted to talk to you.","Superman"
"1014",6264660,6267470,"I've been in this news game 40 years man and boy...","Superman"
"1015",6267670,6272400,"...and I got where I am with guts, compassion...","Superman"
"1016",6272820,6275860,"...elbow grease and something you're sadly lacking in, son.","Superman"
"1017",6276820,6277620,"Humility?","Superman"
"1018",6277950,6280540,"Not humility, you've got bags of humility.","Superman"
"1019",6281040,6282480,"Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.","Superman"
"1020",6282680,6287640,"Take charge. Let people know who you are.","Superman"
"1021",6294300,6295880,"This is Lex Luthor.","Superman"
"1022",6296430,6300010,"Only one thing alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency.","Superman"
"1023",6300100,6301100,"That's you.","Superman"
"1024",6301600,6306660,"In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet containing propane lithium compound...","Superman"
"1025",6306850,6309940,"... will be released through thousands of air ducts in this city...","Superman"
"1026",6310020,6312510,"... effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis.","Superman"
"1027",6312710,6316660,"I was a reporter before most of my friends were copy boys.","Superman"
"1028",6317070,6319780,"I want you to get Lois to introduce you to Superman.","Superman"
"1029",6320080,6323250,"Find out who he is. Where did he get that blue suit?","Superman"
"1030",6323370,6325530,"Did he have it made? Is it silk? Is it plastic?","Superman"
"1031",6325730,6327530,"I know it all seems a bit much...","Superman"
"1032",6327730,6329530,"... but how else was I going to meet you, Superman?","Superman"
"1033",6329730,6334690,"I knew you'd never accept an invitation to tea.","Superman"
"1034",6334730,6340710,"But a disaster, with people in danger, people who need help...","Superman"
"1035",6340740,6345730,"I just knew you couldn't resist that chance to sort of pitch in.","Superman"
"1036",6346520,6347850,"You know what I mean?","Superman"
"1037",6381220,6384430,"There's a strong streak of good in you, Superman.","Superman"
"1038",6385560,6387270,"But then nobody's perfect.","Superman"
"1039",6390730,6392110,"Almost nobody.","Superman"
"1040",6401370,6402700,"- Oh, Superman! - Gee!","Superman"
"1041",6403120,6406040,"Stand back, please. Nothing to get worried about.","Superman"
"1042",6411880,6413840,"Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!","Superman"
"1043",6414200,6415780,"I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"1044",6434990,6436790,"He's definitely coming, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"1045",6448380,6449680,"It's open, come in.","Superman"
"1046",6452470,6455760,"My attorney will be in touch with you about the damage to the door.","Superman"
"1047",6455890,6461770,"Otis, take the gentleman's cape.","Superman"
"1048",6463480,6465270,"I don't think he wants me to, Mr. Luthor.","Superman"
"1049",6465360,6466780,"Where's the gas pellet?","Superman"
"1050",6467440,6468320,"Somewhere.","Superman"
"1051",6470570,6472570,"It's in the back of my mind, actually.","Superman"
"1052",6473700,6475580,"It's a little idea I was toying with.","Superman"
"1053",6475660,6478370,"Is that how a warped brain like yours gets its kicks?","Superman"
"1054",6478450,6480660,"By planning the death of innocent people?","Superman"
"1055",6481620,6483470,"By causing the death of innocent people.","Superman"
"1056",6483670,6484670,"Fire!","Superman"
"1057",6487550,6489970,"Navy Bird, we have a good launch.","Superman"
"1058",6490550,6492010,"Navy missile...","Superman"
"1059",6501270,6503770,"As you may or may not know, I am, as they say...","Superman"
"1060",6504610,6506440,"...very heavy into real estate.","Superman"
"1061",6507070,6511500,"To make money, you have to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?","Superman"
"1062",6511700,6512660,"Right.","Superman"
"1063",6514200,6515700,"So, the problem?","Superman"
"1064",6516950,6519960,"How to make the land more valuable between the time you buy it...","Superman"
"1065",6520160,6521750,"...and the time you sell it?","Superman"
"1066",6522620,6524540,"Now this is California.","Superman"
"1067",6525210,6527460,"The richest, most populous state in the Union.","Superman"
"1068",6527550,6529710,"I don't need a geography lesson from you.","Superman"
"1069",6530670,6534770,"Of course, you've been there. I do forget, you get around, don't you?","Superman"
"1070",6534970,6535970,"Where was I?","Superman"
"1071",6536510,6538140,"- California. - California, right.","Superman"
"1072",6538220,6540860,"The San Andreas Fault, maybe you've heard of it?","Superman"
"1073",6541060,6543240,"Yes. It's the joining together of two land masses.","Superman"
"1074",6543440,6547620,"The fault line is shifting, which is why you get earthquakes in California.","Superman"
"1075",6547820,6550870,"Wonderful! Couldn't have said it better myself.","Superman"
"1076",6551070,6555250,"Everything west of this line is the richest, most expensive real estate in the world.","Superman"
"1077",6555450,6558030,"San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.","Superman"
"1078",6558120,6560040,"Everything on this side of the line...","Superman"
"1079",6560160,6563050,"...is just hundreds of miles of worthless desert land...","Superman"
"1080",6563250,6565500,"...which just happens to be owned by...","Superman"
"1081",6565620,6568800,"Lex Luthor Incorporated.","Superman"
"1082",6569000,6573310,"Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.","Superman"
"1083",6573510,6576550,"It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...","Superman"
"1084",6576890,6579480,"...planted at just the proper point would...","Superman"
"1085",6579680,6581890,"Would destroy most of California.","Superman"
"1086",6583430,6586990,"Millions of people would be killed and the West Coast as we know it would...","Superman"
"1087",6587190,6591410,"Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.","Superman"
"1088",6591610,6594200,"Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.","Superman"
"1089",6596860,6598830,"Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.","Superman"

"1096",6612710,6615010,"I'll just wipe it off, that's all.","Superman"
"1097",6615130,6616730,"You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.","Superman"
"1098",6616930,6620350,"A sick, twisted dreamer. Your plan couldn't possibly work.","Superman"
"1099",6620550,6622640,"I'll admit there were a few problems.","Superman"
"1100",6623100,6626030,"Adjusting the precise trajectory of the missile.","Superman"
"1101",6626230,6629310,"Finding the optimum stress point for the fault line itself...","Superman"
"1102",6630060,6632780,"...which, by the way, is target zero. Right...","Superman"
"1103",6632980,6637940,"...here.","Superman"
"1104",6661260,6662930,"That's impossible!","Superman"
"1105",6664890,6666600,"What's happening, Lieutenant?","Superman"
"1106",6666680,6670360,"Trajectory malfunction, sir.","Superman"

"1111",6679910,6681240,"Can't you knock them down?","Superman"
"1112",6681320,6686000,"Absolutely impossible, sir. They have the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.","Superman"
"1113",6686040,6687500,"Get me the Pentagon.","Superman"
"1114",6694550,6697430,"What do you think, super baby? Interesting?","Superman"
"1115",6697630,6699760,"Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.","Superman"
"1116",6699840,6702140,"Would you go to the viewing room, please?","Superman"
"1117",6702970,6705770,"But as for the rest, it's nothing but a sick fantasy.","Superman"
"1118",6705970,6706850,"Fantasy?","Superman"
"1119",6707180,6708140,"No.","Superman"
"1120",6709190,6711520,"It's history. It's happening, Superman.","Superman"

"1122",6718740,6719990,"Yes, Lex?","Superman"
"1123",6720360,6721780,"Where's the rocket now?","Superman"
"1124",6721990,6725660,"It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon, so is the other one.","Superman"
"1125",6725780,6726830,"The other one?","Superman"
"1126",6727160,6728500,"There are two of them?","Superman"
"1127",6731540,6733830,"Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.","Superman"
"1128",6734500,6737550,"Even you, with your great speed, couldn't stop both of them.","Superman"
"1129",6737670,6741020,"While I, on the other hand, could stop them with my detonator.","Superman"
"1130",6741220,6743010,"All right, Luthor, where is it?","Superman"
"1131",6743720,6745140,"Where's the detonator?","Superman"
"1132",6758650,6760150,"Diseased maniac!","Superman"
"1133",6760690,6765080,"Do you think you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead?","Superman"
"1134",6765740,6768120,"I'll mold this box into your prison bars.","Superman"
"1135",6768200,6769370,"Don't touch that.","Superman"
"1136",6776210,6777250,"I told you.","Superman"
"1137",6778000,6779260,"It's Kryptonite.","Superman"
"1138",6779670,6781630,"A little souvenir from your hometown.","Superman"

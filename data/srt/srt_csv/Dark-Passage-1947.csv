"668",3233586,3235421,"What kind of a riddle is this?","Dark Passage"
"669",3235463,3238716,"Madge pestered him, kept afterhim till she had a hold on him.","Dark Passage"
"670",3238758,3241678,"That's why he killed his wife,to get her out of the way.","Dark Passage"
"671",3241761,3244305,"He killed Gertrude because he hated her.","Dark Passage"
"672",3244389,3247893,"- That's why he'll kill me! He hates me!- He doesn't hate you.","Dark Passage"

"678",3261407,3262700,"He's got nothing more to lose.","Dark Passage"
"679",3262783,3265828,"That's why he'll look for meuntil he finds me and kills me!","Dark Passage"
"680",3265911,3269498,"I never met Parry, but I knowpsychologically, he's no killer.","Dark Passage"
"681",3269582,3273127,"- He was just dumb.- What makes you think you're so smart?","Dark Passage"

"696",3322470,3323596,"I did not.","Dark Passage"
"697",3323679,3326474,"But I hired your little rat atdouble his price to watch you.","Dark Passage"
"698",3326516,3328393,"The very next day, he made good.","Dark Passage"
"699",3328476,3330353,"He told me a man named Vincent Parry...","Dark Passage"

"701",3333898,3336026,"I have his sworn statement.","Dark Passage"
"702",3336568,3339946,"Why didn't you give it to Parry'slawyer at the time of the trial?","Dark Passage"
"703",3340030,3343075,"Lt'd only have given the juryanother reason why he killed Gert.","Dark Passage"
"704",3343158,3347246,"- I knew Parry was guilty, anyway, so...- And besides, it would have involved you.","Dark Passage"
"705",3347329,3349498,"Sure. I didn't want any part of the mess.","Dark Passage"
"706",3349540,3353168,"That's all a vicious lie. He'sjust trying to make me look bad.","Dark Passage"
"707",3353210,3356422,"- You'd better go now, Madge.- I won't go home alone.","Dark Passage"
"708",3356505,3357673,"Bob will take you.","Dark Passage"

"746",3496734,3500321,"Just pick up the sofa and throw it ather. Maybe that'd make her catch on.","Dark Passage"

"786",3869745,3872373,"I may not hear it again for a long time.","Dark Passage"
"787",3892144,3893895,"When are you going?","Dark Passage"
"788",3895564,3897691,"- The quicker, the better.- Where?","Dark Passage"
"789",3897983,3900694,"To clear myself. To find out who killed them.","Dark Passage"
"790",3900778,3903906,"Are you curious enough tostart taking chances again?","Dark Passage"
"791",3903948,3905449,"Or angry enough?","Dark Passage"
"792",3905533,3908369,"No, I'm not angry.","Dark Passage"
"793",3908744,3912748,"Maybe curious, but not angry. Ishould be, I suppose, but I'm not.","Dark Passage"

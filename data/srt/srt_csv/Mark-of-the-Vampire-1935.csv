"420",2090665,2093225,"It is then they are powerless.","Mark of the Vampire"
"421",2093301,2096793,"Then we must leave at daybreak.It's our chance to get away from here.","Mark of the Vampire"
"422",2096871,2097963,"What?","Mark of the Vampire"
"423",2098039,2101805,"And leave these monsters hereto continue their work of destruction?","Mark of the Vampire"
"424",2101876,2105004,"- It would be cowardice.- What else is there to do?","Mark of the Vampire"
"425",2105079,2109106,"Search for them.Find their corpse-like bodies.","Mark of the Vampire"
"426",2109183,2112380,"It is in that state and that state only","Mark of the Vampire"
"427",2112453,2114318,"they can be destroyed.","Mark of the Vampire"
"428",2114589,2119185,"Their heads must be severedwith one clean stroke","Mark of the Vampire"
"429",2119260,2123993,"and a sprig of bat thornplaced within the gaping wound.","Mark of the Vampire"
"430",2124165,2126656,"We would be crazy to attemptwhat you're planning.","Mark of the Vampire"
"431",2126734,2130397,"I'll never do it, never.In the morning, we're leaving.","Mark of the Vampire"

"437",2146988,2150253,"Come, gentlemen,let's go to bed and get some rest.","Mark of the Vampire"
"438",2199440,2201601,"I had gone to bed as you said.","Mark of the Vampire"
"439",2202043,2204944,"I laid here for hours trying to go to sleep.","Mark of the Vampire"
"440",2205346,2207610,"But I was restless. I couldn't.","Mark of the Vampire"
"441",2208482,2210416,"Then I heard Maria leave the room.","Mark of the Vampire"
"442",2210484,2213544,"Why did you leave the room?You had your orders.","Mark of the Vampire"
"443",2213621,2216556,"To get some coffee to keep me awake.","Mark of the Vampire"
"444",2216624,2218489,"You fool.","Mark of the Vampire"
"445",2219393,2222726,"And after Maria left the room,then what happened?","Mark of the Vampire"
"446",2223364,2226162,"I heard a sound like wind at the casement.","Mark of the Vampire"
"447",2227068,2228535,"I felt a draft.","Mark of the Vampire"
"448",2229103,2232971,"Then I saw her,just as she was on the terrace.","Mark of the Vampire"
"449",2234108,2237134,"I fought to keep my eyes open,but they closed.","Mark of the Vampire"
"450",2238779,2241373,"I felt again that deadly, cold breath.","Mark of the Vampire"
"451",2242316,2246377,"The horror of it made me feel faint.","Mark of the Vampire"
"452",2247288,2249620,"There, there, my child.","Mark of the Vampire"
"453",2263604,2266732,"That young man, go to him. Hurry.","Mark of the Vampire"

"475",2359433,2361594,"Fortunately, he wasn't harmed.","Mark of the Vampire"
"476",2362069,2365004,"When the maid screamed out to us,","Mark of the Vampire"
"477",2365072,2367905,"it must have frightened the monster away.","Mark of the Vampire"

"491",2435676,2438907,"The dust lies thick and undisturbed.","Mark of the Vampire"
"492",2438979,2443678,"That's what makes it so difficultto find the vampire's hiding place.","Mark of the Vampire"
"493",2443751,2446481,"Well, don't let's stand here talking.Let's go on looking for them.","Mark of the Vampire"

"514",2611719,2613619,"Have you gone mad?","Mark of the Vampire"
"515",2613687,2616281,"One more stupid act and we'll be lost.","Mark of the Vampire"
"516",2616357,2618723,"Please, please don't leave him like this.","Mark of the Vampire"
"517",2618792,2622228,"And expose ourselves to the vengeanceof the others?","Mark of the Vampire"
"518",2622396,2625923,"Why, their fury would follow usto the ends of the earth.","Mark of the Vampire"
"519",2626433,2631370,"No, we must destroy them all together.Come.","Mark of the Vampire"

"584",3017457,3019584,"But you both said Baron Ottowould break down and confess","Mark of the Vampire"
"585",3019659,3023186,"if we confronted him with this gentlemanpretending to be my father.","Mark of the Vampire"
"586",3023263,3026323,"I know, we all thoughtour vampire scheme was so simple,","Mark of the Vampire"

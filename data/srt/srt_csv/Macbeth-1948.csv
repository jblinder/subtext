"135",1006850,1012400,"Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it;","Macbeth"
"136",1012410,1016020,"He died as one that had been studied in his death,","Macbeth"
"137",1016030,1022370,"to throw away the dearest thing he owed,as 'twere a careless trifle.","Macbeth"
"138",1022400,1028530,"There's no art to find the mind's constructionin the face: he was a gentleman,","Macbeth"

"143",1045270,1049360,"The service and the loyalty I owe in doing it,pays itself.","Macbeth"
"144",1049840,1054910,"Noble Banquo, thou hadst no less deserved,","Macbeth"
"145",1054920,1057450,"nor must be known no less to have done so.","Macbeth"
"146",1058210,1059640,"Give me your hand.","Macbeth"

"152",1113100,1119480,"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere wellit were done quickly.","Macbeth"
"153",1119490,1127010,"If the assassination could trammel up the consequenceand catch with his surcease success,","Macbeth"

"179",1269970,1270740,"Who's there?","Macbeth"
"180",1271400,1272210,"A friend.","Macbeth"
"181",1278070,1280110,"What, sir, not yet at rest?","Macbeth"
"182",1284000,1285250,"The king's a-bed.","Macbeth"
"183",1285990,1290520,"He hath been in unusual pleasure, andsent forth great largess to your offices.","Macbeth"
"184",1290890,1294100,"This diamond he greets your wife withal.","Macbeth"
"185",1304580,1307450,"I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:","Macbeth"
"186",1308720,1310440,"To you they have show'd some truth.","Macbeth"

"189",1320750,1324480,"Thanks, sir: the like to you!","Macbeth"
"190",1347600,1356270,"Now o'er the one halfworld nature seems dead,","Macbeth"
"191",1357450,1360980,"and wicked dreams abuse the curtain'd sleep.","Macbeth"
"192",1362130,1368200,"witchcraft celebrates pale Hecate's offerings,and wither'd murder,","Macbeth"
"193",1368890,1373210,"Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,whose howl's his watch,","Macbeth"
"194",1374370,1376230,"thus with his stealthy pace.","Macbeth"
"195",1376240,1385390,"with Tarquin's ravishing strides,towards his design moves like a ghost.","Macbeth"

"200",1407120,1410980,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight?","Macbeth"
"201",1410990,1418170,"or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation,proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?","Macbeth"
"202",1419560,1425280,"I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeongouts of blood,","Macbeth"
"203",1425290,1428680,"which was not so before.","Macbeth"
"204",1428690,1431360,"There's no such thing.","Macbeth"
"205",1446650,1447430,"What news?","Macbeth"
"206",1448900,1451380,"The doors are open;","Macbeth"
"207",1453530,1457460,"and the surfeited grooms do mocktheir charge with snores.","Macbeth"
"208",1464580,1467270,"We will proceed no further in this business.","Macbeth"
"209",1468500,1474000,"Was the hope drunk wherein you dress'd yourself?hath it slept since?","Macbeth"
"210",1474010,1478560,"and wakes it now, to look so green and paleon what it did so freely?","Macbeth"
"211",1479980,1483470,"From this time such I account thy love.","Macbeth"
"212",1484690,1490960,"Art thou afeard to be the same in thine own actand valour as thou art in desire?","Macbeth"

"215",1496150,1499440,"What beast was't, then, that made youbreak this enterprise to me?","Macbeth"
"216",1501100,1505510,"When you durst do it, then you were a man;","Macbeth"
"217",1507600,1513380,"And, to be more than what you were, you wouldbe so much more the man.","Macbeth"
"218",1514500,1524760,"I have given suck, and know how tender 'tisto love the babe that milks me.","Macbeth"
"219",1525720,1534760,"I would, while it was smiling in my face,have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,","Macbeth"

"222",1540850,1542030,"We fail!","Macbeth"
"223",1543670,1550330,"But screw your courage to the sticking-place,and we'll not fail.","Macbeth"
"224",1558230,1565130,"Thou sure and firm-set earth,hear not my steps, which way they walk,","Macbeth"
"225",1566760,1570150,"for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout.","Macbeth"
"226",1570160,1573670,"I go and it is done; the bell invites me.","Macbeth"
"227",1574400,1581080,"Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knellthat summons thee to heaven or to hell.","Macbeth"
"228",1590430,1595640,"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;","Macbeth"
"229",1596500,1602770,"What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.","Macbeth"
"230",1612200,1612920,"Hark!","Macbeth"
"231",1616840,1617680,"Peace!","Macbeth"
"232",1620700,1623940,"It was the owl that shriek'd.","Macbeth"
"233",1628090,1631170,"He is about it.","Macbeth"
"234",1631180,1632370,"Who's there? What, ho!","Macbeth"
"235",1633220,1633960,"Alack!","Macbeth"
"236",1636070,1639290,"I am afraid they have awaked,and 'tis not done.","Macbeth"
"237",1641620,1644610,"The attempt and not the deed confounds us.","Macbeth"
"238",1647860,1648690,"Hark!","Macbeth"
"239",1652320,1656860,"I laid their daggers ready; he could not miss 'em.","Macbeth"
"240",1667540,1674120,"I have done the deed.Didst thou not hear a noise?","Macbeth"
"241",1674400,1676480,"I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.","Macbeth"
"242",1676610,1677870,"Did not you speak? /When?/Now.","Macbeth"
"243",1677880,1679400,"As I descended?/ Ay./Hark!","Macbeth"
"244",1682800,1685140,"This is a sorry sight.","Macbeth"
"245",1685230,1687580,"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.","Macbeth"
"246",1688700,1695170,"There's one did laugh in's sleep,and one cried 'Murder!'","Macbeth"
"247",1695930,1698330,"That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them.","Macbeth"
"248",1699450,1703820,"But they did say their prayers, and address'd them again to sleep.","Macbeth"
"249",1703830,1705040,"There are two lodged together.","Macbeth"
"250",1705050,1710730,"One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other,","Macbeth"
"251",1712950,1716800,"as they had seen me with these hangman's hands.","Macbeth"
"252",1718250,1721460,"Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'","Macbeth"
"253",1723250,1724710,"when they did say 'God bless us!'","Macbeth"
"254",1724720,1726570,"Consider it not so deeply.","Macbeth"
"255",1726720,1729870,"But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?","Macbeth"
"256",1732100,1734660,"I had most need of blessing,","Macbeth"
"257",1737390,1740630,"and 'Amen' stuck in my throat.","Macbeth"
"258",1741100,1745230,"These deeds must not be thought after these ways;","Macbeth"
"259",1746810,1748290,"so, it will make us mad.","Macbeth"
"260",1749400,1752340,"Had I but died an hour before this chance,","Macbeth"
"261",1754630,1756180,"I had lived a blessed time","Macbeth"
"262",1756870,1760770,"for, from this instant, there 'snothing serious in mortality:","Macbeth"
"263",1761360,1765970,"All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;","Macbeth"
"264",1767100,1773360,"the wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees isleft this vault to brag of.","Macbeth"
"265",1775880,1778660,"Go get some water,","Macbeth"
"266",1778670,1782120,"and wash this filthy witness from your hand.","Macbeth"
"267",1785170,1788120,"Why did you bring these daggers from the place?","Macbeth"
"268",1788850,1789930,"They must lie there","Macbeth"
"269",1790570,1794150,"Go carry them; and smearthe sleepy grooms with blood.","Macbeth"
"270",1796640,1797990,"I'll go no more.","Macbeth"
"271",1800280,1802230,"I am afraid to think what I have done.","Macbeth"
"272",1804280,1806380,"Look on't again I dare not.","Macbeth"
"273",1807170,1809210,"Infirm of purpose!","Macbeth"
"274",1810940,1812960,"Give me the daggers.","Macbeth"
"275",1815700,1818320,"The sleeping and the dead are but as pictures","Macbeth"
"276",1818330,1822190,"'tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil.","Macbeth"
"277",1825010,1830370,"If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,","Macbeth"
"278",1831550,1833450,"for it must seem their guilt.","Macbeth"
"279",1836370,1837500,"Whence is that knocking?","Macbeth"
"280",1838550,1842350,"How is't with me, when every noise appals me?","Macbeth"
"281",1843090,1844550,"What hands are here?","Macbeth"
"282",1847300,1849730,"Ha! They pluck out mine eyes.","Macbeth"
"283",1852690,1855990,"Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this bloodclean from my hand?","Macbeth"
"284",1857240,1863750,"No, this my hand will ratherthe multitudinous seas in incarnadine,","Macbeth"
"285",1865830,1870680,"making the green one red.","Macbeth"
"286",1872190,1874890,"My hands are of your colour;","Macbeth"
"287",1875970,1879240,"but I shame to wear a heart so white.","Macbeth"
"288",1883720,1885520,"Retire we to our chamber;","Macbeth"
"289",1886630,1889850,"A little water clears us of this deed.","Macbeth"
"290",1890950,1893170,"How easy is it, then!","Macbeth"
"291",1896300,1898380,"Hark! More knocking.","Macbeth"

"293",1908000,1912050,"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.","Macbeth"
"294",1913690,1918090,"Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!","Macbeth"
"295",1925990,1927830,"Who's there?","Macbeth"

"297",1935270,1939340,"Knock, knock! Knock, knock! Knock!","Macbeth"
"298",1950200,1951780,"It is Macduff!","Macbeth"
"299",1951790,1954820,"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, that you do lie so late?","Macbeth"

"443",2631550,2635670,"when our actions do not,our fears do make us traitors.","Macbeth"
"444",2636840,2640860,"You know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear.","Macbeth"
"445",2641620,2642440,"Wisdom!","Macbeth"
"446",2643140,2650530,"to leave his wife, to leave his babes,all in a place from whence himself does fly?","Macbeth"
"447",2676600,2681970,"We hear, Macdoff and Malcolm are gone hence,not confessing their cruel murders,","Macbeth"
"448",2682110,2685120,"but filling their hearers with strange invention.","Macbeth"
"449",2688650,2692010,"But of that to-morrow, here's our chief guest.","Macbeth"
"450",2692400,2697390,"If he had been forgotten,it had been as a gap in our great feast,","Macbeth"
"451",2697400,2700120,"And all-thing unbecoming.","Macbeth"
"452",2700350,2705970,"To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,and I'll request your presence.","Macbeth"
"453",2706400,2709170,"Let your highness command upon me.","Macbeth"
"454",2709400,2710870,"Ride you this afternoon?","Macbeth"
"455",2711230,2712660,"Ay, my good lord.","Macbeth"
"456",2713000,2717370,"We should have else desired your good advice,in this day's council,","Macbeth"
"457",2717950,2719050,"but we'll take to-morrow.","Macbeth"
"458",2720590,2721730,"Is't far you ride?","Macbeth"
"459",2723360,2728610,"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time'twixt this and supper.","Macbeth"
"460",2733150,2734680,"Fail not our feast.","Macbeth"
"461",2735900,2737880,"My lord, I will not.","Macbeth"
"462",2738550,2739270,"Farewell.","Macbeth"
"463",2742260,2747290,"Let every man be master of his time till seven at night:","Macbeth"
"464",2747780,2753560,"To make society the sweeter welcome,we will keep ourself till supper-time alone.","Macbeth"
"465",2754570,2756470,"While then, God be with you!","Macbeth"
"466",2776870,2779390,"Our fears in Banquo stick deeper.","Macbeth"
"467",2782020,2785600,"and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd","Macbeth"
"468",2787350,2788550,"'tis much he dares;","Macbeth"
"469",2790540,2795950,"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety.","Macbeth"
"470",2798060,2800230,"There is none but he whose being I do fear;","Macbeth"
"471",2800240,2803090,"and, under him, my Genius is rebuked;","Macbeth"
"472",2804720,2808290,"as, it is said, Mark Antony's was by Caesar.","Macbeth"
"473",2813120,2816520,"Let the frame of things disjoint,","Macbeth"
"474",2817970,2819570,"both the worlds suffer,","Macbeth"
"475",2821910,2824290,"ere we will eat our meal in fear","Macbeth"
"476",2825050,2829880,"and sleep in the affliction of these terribledreams that shake us nightly.","Macbeth"
"477",2830350,2831640,"Better be with the dead,","Macbeth"
"478",2833510,2836810,"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,","Macbeth"
"479",2837080,2844530,"than on the torture of the mindto lie in restless ecstasy.","Macbeth"
"480",2846520,2847970,"Duncan is in his grave;","Macbeth"
"481",2850040,2854110,"After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;","Macbeth"
"482",2856030,2861280,"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,","Macbeth"
"483",2862570,2864950,"malice domestic, foreign levy,","Macbeth"
"484",2866790,2872090,"nothing can touch him further.","Macbeth"
"485",2876950,2878150,"Attend those men our pleasure?","Macbeth"
"486",2878890,2880420,"They are, my lord, without the palace gate.","Macbeth"
"487",2880800,2881690,"Bring them before us.","Macbeth"
"488",2919650,2923030,"Was it not yesterday we spoke together?","Macbeth"
"489",2923760,2927460,"It was, so please your highness.","Macbeth"
"490",2928610,2934980,"Well then, now have you consider'd of my speeches?","Macbeth"
"491",2937840,2944370,"Know that it was he in the times pastwhich held you so under fortune,","Macbeth"
"492",2945190,2947090,"which you thought had been our innocent self.","Macbeth"
"493",2947100,2949250,"You made it known to us.","Macbeth"
"494",2949560,2953880,"Do you find your patience so predominantin your nature that you can let this go?","Macbeth"
"495",2955350,2959950,"Are you so gospell'd to pray for this good manand for his issue,","Macbeth"
"496",2959960,2963180,"whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the graveand beggar'd yours for ever?","Macbeth"
"497",2963190,2964420,"We are men, my liege.","Macbeth"
"498",2964430,2967370,"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;","Macbeth"
"499",2967380,2971590,"as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,","Macbeth"
"500",2971600,2976610,"shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolvesare clept all by the name of dogs.","Macbeth"
"501",2977820,2982380,"But if you have a station in the file,not i' the worst rank of manhood.","Macbeth"
"502",2983800,2984190,"Say 't!","Macbeth"
"503",2984200,2985730,"I am one, my liege,","Macbeth"
"504",2985740,2990650,"whom the vile blows and buffets of the worldhave so incensed","Macbeth"
"505",2990660,2994610,"that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.","Macbeth"
"506",2994620,2995580,"And I another","Macbeth"
"507",2995760,2998370,"Both of you know Banquo was your enemy.","Macbeth"
"508",2999060,2999830,"True, my lord.","Macbeth"
"509",3000350,3001610,"So is he mine.","Macbeth"
"510",3003330,3008280,"and in such bloody distance that every minute ofhis being thrusts against my near'st of life.","Macbeth"
"511",3008600,3010960,"We shall, my lord, perform what you command us.","Macbeth"
"512",3011040,3013220,"Your spirits shine through you.","Macbeth"
"513",3013990,3018150,"Within this hour at most I will advise youwhere to plant yourselves;","Macbeth"
"514",3019900,3024230,"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,the moment on't","Macbeth"

"517",3031200,3033520,"and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work","Macbeth"
"518",3034010,3039030,"Fleance his son, that keeps him company,","Macbeth"
"519",3039040,3042850,"whose absence is no less material to methan is his father's","Macbeth"
"520",3043840,3046880,"Must embrace the fate of that dark hour.","Macbeth"
"521",3049110,3050510,"Resolve yourselves apart:","Macbeth"
"522",3052450,3053240,"I'll come to you anon.","Macbeth"
"523",3053250,3054720,"We are resolved, my lord.","Macbeth"
"524",3054900,3065320,"It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,if it find heaven, must find it out to-night.","Macbeth"
"525",3070160,3074590,"Gentle, my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks.","Macbeth"
"526",3075200,3079250,"Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.","Macbeth"
"527",3080340,3087640,"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!","Macbeth"
"528",3089180,3095460,"Yet be thou jocund:ere the bat hath flown his cloister'd flight,","Macbeth"

"531",3103480,3107250,"there shall be done a deed of dreadful note.","Macbeth"
"532",3107260,3109240,"What's to be done?","Macbeth"
"533",3109890,3115260,"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,","Macbeth"
"534",3116500,3118140,"till thou applaud the deed.","Macbeth"
"535",3120270,3123530,"Come, seeling night,","Macbeth"
"536",3124800,3129520,"scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;","Macbeth"
"537",3129530,3135280,"And with thy bloody and invisible handcancel and tear to pieces","Macbeth"
"538",3135290,3138150,"that great bond which keeps me pale!","Macbeth"
"539",3139500,3145410,"Light thickens; and the crow makeswing to the rooky wood.","Macbeth"
"540",3145690,3149250,"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,","Macbeth"
"541",3150380,3155900,"while night's black agents to their preys do rouse.","Macbeth"
"542",3164320,3168230,"The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:","Macbeth"
"543",3169460,3173940,"Now spurs the lated traveller apace to gain the timely inn;","Macbeth"
"544",3174820,3178190,"and near approaches the subject of our watch./Hark!","Macbeth"
"545",3180970,3182400,"Then 'tis he./Stand to't.","Macbeth"
"546",3183350,3184540,"It will be rain to-night.","Macbeth"
"547",3184870,3186080,"Let it come down.","Macbeth"
"548",3186740,3190340,"Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly!","Macbeth"
"549",3193510,3194480,"The son is fled.","Macbeth"
"550",3196190,3198200,"We have lost best half of our affair.","Macbeth"
"551",3202150,3206960,"Well, let's away, and say how much is done.","Macbeth"
"552",3218730,3220370,"There's blood on thy face.","Macbeth"
"553",3220380,3221680,"'Tis Banquo's then.","Macbeth"
"554",3226280,3227180,"Is he dispatch'd?","Macbeth"
"555",3227190,3230220,"My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.","Macbeth"
"556",3230230,3231960,"Thou art the best o' the cut-throats:","Macbeth"
"557",3231970,3234370,"yet he's good that did the like for Fleance","Macbeth"
"558",3234980,3238090,"Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.","Macbeth"
"559",3241330,3242560,"Then comes my fit again","Macbeth"
"560",3243200,3247050,"I had else been perfect, whole as the marble,founded as the rock,","Macbeth"
"561",3247060,3249430,"as broad and general as the casing air:","Macbeth"
"562",3249660,3256370,"But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,bound in to saucy doubts and fears.","Macbeth"
"563",3257110,3257850,"But Banquo's safe?","Macbeth"
"564",3257860,3263720,"Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,with twenty trenched gashes on his head,","Macbeth"
"565",3264010,3265690,"the least a death to nature.","Macbeth"
"566",3267560,3268320,"Thanks for that.","Macbeth"
"567",3286230,3292350,"Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all; all,","Macbeth"
"568",3293770,3295670,"as the weird women promised.","Macbeth"
"569",3296100,3299540,"And, I fear, thou play'dst most foully for't.","Macbeth"
"570",3300380,3303730,"Thou play'dst most foully for't:","Macbeth"
"571",3304570,3308610,"Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity,","Macbeth"
"572",3308970,3313090,"But that myself should be the root and fatherof many kings.","Macbeth"
"573",3314030,3315170,"Is't far you ride?","Macbeth"
"574",3316060,3320370,"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time'twixt this and supper","Macbeth"
"575",3321220,3323100,"Fail not our feast.","Macbeth"
"576",3323410,3325410,"My lord, I will not.","Macbeth"
"577",3326050,3326850,"I will not.","Macbeth"
"578",3327900,3328780,"I will not.","Macbeth"
"579",3329660,3330260,"I will not.","Macbeth"
"580",3331800,3336020,"I will not fail your feast.","Macbeth"

"582",3385820,3386380,"Sit down.","Macbeth"
"583",3394280,3397100,"And first and last the hearty welcome.","Macbeth"
"584",3403630,3406390,"Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,","Macbeth"
"585",3407850,3411120,"Were the graced person of our Banquo present;","Macbeth"
"586",3411220,3414250,"His absence, sir, lays blame upon his promise.","Macbeth"
"587",3417550,3421930,"My royal lord, you do not give the cheer.","Macbeth"
"588",3422940,3424120,"Sweet remembrancer!","Macbeth"
"589",3429330,3433640,"I drink to our good friend Banquowhom we miss!","Macbeth"
"590",3436270,3438000,"Would he were here!","Macbeth"
"591",3460590,3461980,"Which of you have done this?","Macbeth"
"592",3465300,3467640,"What is't that moves your highness?","Macbeth"
"593",3469730,3475490,"Thou canst not say I did it;Never shake thy gory locks at me.","Macbeth"
"594",3475500,3477810,"Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well.","Macbeth"
"595",3477820,3479640,"Sit, worthy friends.","Macbeth"
"596",3480100,3483450,"My lord is often thus, and hath been from his youth.","Macbeth"
"597",3484500,3485210,"Look!","Macbeth"
"598",3487400,3488150,"Lo!","Macbeth"
"599",3489900,3490880,"How say you?","Macbeth"
"600",3509890,3514480,"Think of this, good peers, but as a thing of custom:","Macbeth"
"601",3514740,3515800,"'tis no other.","Macbeth"
"602",3516470,3519120,"Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.","Macbeth"
"603",3521090,3522030,"Shame itself!","Macbeth"
"604",3522500,3524250,"Why do you make such faces?","Macbeth"
"605",3524800,3527210,"When all's done, you look but on a stool.","Macbeth"
"606",3527890,3531400,"Avaunt! and quit my sight!","Macbeth"
"607",3531630,3533540,"Let the earth hide thee!","Macbeth"
"608",3533550,3537340,"Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold.","Macbeth"
"609",3537690,3540860,"Thou hast no speculation in those eyeswhich thou dost glare with!","Macbeth"
"610",3541090,3545570,"The fit is momentary;upon a thought he will again be well.","Macbeth"
"611",3545580,3548550,"What man dare, I dare:","Macbeth"
"612",3549500,3555080,"Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,the arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger.","Macbeth"
"613",3555090,3561430,"Take any shape but that, and my firm nervesshall never tremble;","Macbeth"
"614",3562020,3565030,"or be alive again, and dare me to the desertwith thy sword.","Macbeth"
"615",3565390,3569040,"If trembling I inhabit then,protest me the baby of a girl.","Macbeth"
"616",3570200,3572620,"Hence, horrible shadow!","Macbeth"
"617",3573320,3576330,"This is the very painting of your fear.","Macbeth"
"618",3577130,3582070,"This is the air-drawn daggerwhich, you said, led you to Duncan.","Macbeth"
"619",3583850,3584930,"Duncan!","Macbeth"
"620",3588550,3592270,"Why, what care I?","Macbeth"
"621",3593260,3598020,"If thou canst nod, speak too.","Macbeth"
"622",3598950,3607190,"If charnel-houses and our graves mustsend those that we bury back,","Macbeth"
"623",3607420,3611490,"our monuments shall be the maws of kites.","Macbeth"
"624",3613850,3615570,"Fie, for shame!","Macbeth"
"625",3617080,3621450,"Blood hath been shed ere now,","Macbeth"
"626",3622380,3626570,"i' the olden time, ere human statute purged the gentle weal","Macbeth"
"627",3626580,3634200,"Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'dtoo terrible for the ear.","Macbeth"
"628",3635810,3640550,"The times have been, that, when the brains were out,the man would die,","Macbeth"
"629",3641730,3644690,"and there an end; but now they rise again,","Macbeth"
"630",3644890,3652010,"with twenty mortal murders on their crowns,and push us from our stools.","Macbeth"
"631",3653090,3657730,"This is more strange than such a murder is.","Macbeth"
"632",3660770,3666120,"You make me strange even tothe disposition that I owe,","Macbeth"
"633",3668300,3674090,"when now I think you can behold such sights,","Macbeth"
"634",3675250,3682880,"and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,when mine is blanched with fear.","Macbeth"
"635",3683170,3684300,"What sights, my lord?","Macbeth"
"636",3685220,3689730,"I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse.","Macbeth"
"637",3690330,3694050,"Question enrages him. At once, good night.","Macbeth"
"638",3697700,3703610,"Stand not upon the order of your going,but go at once.","Macbeth"
"639",3704340,3706660,"Good night; and better health attend his majesty!","Macbeth"
"640",3706670,3709660,"A kind good night to all!","Macbeth"
"641",3727920,3733940,"It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood.","Macbeth"
"642",3737090,3742620,"Stones have been known to move and trees to speak.","Macbeth"
"643",3744590,3751160,"Augurs and understood relations have bymagot-pies and choughs and rooks","Macbeth"
"644",3752100,3755690,"brought forth the secret'st man of blood.","Macbeth"
"645",3759090,3760230,"What is the night?","Macbeth"
"646",3760780,3765370,"Almost at odds with morning, which is which.","Macbeth"
"647",3765830,3771050,"How say'st thou, that Macduff denieshis person at our great bidding?","Macbeth"
"648",3772310,3774240,"Did you send to him, sir?","Macbeth"
"649",3774750,3780530,"I hear it by the way; but I will send.","Macbeth"
"650",3782700,3787080,"There's not a one of them but in his houseI keep a servant fee'd.","Macbeth"
"651",3806400,3808310,"More shall they speak;","Macbeth"
"652",3812500,3820920,"for now I am bent to know, by the worst means, the worst.","Macbeth"
"653",3823500,3830740,"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!","Macbeth"
"654",3831420,3833680,"I conjure you, by that which you profess.","Macbeth"
"655",3834250,3836920,"Howe'er you come to know it, answer me.","Macbeth"

"870",5109550,5114490,"I have two nights watched with you,but can perceive no truth in your report.","Macbeth"
"871",5114500,5120420,"Doctor, I have seen her rise from her bed,throw her night-gown upon her,","Macbeth"
"872",5120430,5127630,"unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it,","Macbeth"
"873",5127640,5134190,"and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.","Macbeth"
"874",5134200,5138230,"what, at any time, have you heard her say?","Macbeth"
"875",5138240,5140870,"That, doctor, which I will not report after her.","Macbeth"
"876",5140880,5144060,"You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.","Macbeth"
"877",5144070,5150210,"Lo you, here she comes!And, upon my life, fast asleep.","Macbeth"
"878",5154700,5155880,"How came she by that light?","Macbeth"
"879",5155890,5158460,"She has light by her continually;'tis her command.","Macbeth"
"880",5165720,5171090,"You see, her eyes are open./Ay, but their sense is shut.","Macbeth"
"881",5180010,5183030,"Yet here's a spot.","Macbeth"
"882",5186560,5189010,"Look, how she rubs her hands.","Macbeth"
"883",5189020,5196390,"It is an accustomed action with her,to seem thus washing her hands.","Macbeth"
"884",5196400,5202970,"Out, damned spot! out, I say!","Macbeth"
"885",5208150,5215610,"One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.","Macbeth"
"886",5219290,5222500,"Hell is murky!","Macbeth"
"887",5227590,5231260,"Fie, my lord, fie!","Macbeth"
"888",5232990,5234080,"Do you mark that?","Macbeth"
"889",5235140,5242250,"Yet who would have thought the old manto have had so much blood in him.","Macbeth"
"890",5246330,5259970,"The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?","Macbeth"
"891",5262500,5268140,"What, will these hands ne'er be clean?","Macbeth"
"892",5270450,5274190,"No more o' that, my lord, no more o'that,you mar all with this starting.","Macbeth"
"893",5275360,5279580,"Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.","Macbeth"
"894",5279900,5282930,"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.","Macbeth"
"895",5286450,5289670,"Here's the smell of the blood still.","Macbeth"
"896",5292550,5304500,"All the perfumes of Arabia will notsweeten this little hand.","Macbeth"
"897",5320650,5324070,"The heart is sorely charged.","Macbeth"
"898",5324080,5330370,"I would not have such a heart in my bosomfor the dignity of the whole body.","Macbeth"
"899",5332290,5335800,"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown;","Macbeth"
"900",5337000,5338810,"Look not so pale.","Macbeth"
"901",5340000,5348060,"I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried;he cannot come out on's grave.","Macbeth"
"902",5354430,5356940,"There's knocking at the gate:","Macbeth"
"903",5366650,5370480,"To bed, to bed!","Macbeth"
"904",5372040,5380420,"Come, come, come, come, give me your hand.","Macbeth"
"905",5383000,5387160,"What's done cannot be undone.","Macbeth"
"906",5390300,5394730,"To bed, to bed!","Macbeth"
"907",5422550,5423740,"God forgive us all!","Macbeth"
"908",5529950,5531000,"What is that noise?","Macbeth"
"909",5531440,5533650,"It is the cry of women, my good lord.","Macbeth"
"910",5534460,5536970,"I have almost forgot the taste of fears;","Macbeth"
"911",5538890,5544300,"The time has been, my senses would havecool'd to hear a night-shriek.","Macbeth"
"912",5545850,5552530,"and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatiserouse and stir as life were in't.","Macbeth"
"913",5553820,5559410,"I have supp'd full with horrors.","Macbeth"
"914",5560200,5567810,"Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughtscannot once start me.","Macbeth"
"915",5569900,5571190,"Wherefore was that cry?","Macbeth"
"916",5571200,5574320,"The queen, my lord, is dead.","Macbeth"
"917",5584550,5586310,"She should have died hereafter.","Macbeth"
"918",5586810,5589320,"There would have been a time for such a word.","Macbeth"
"919",5594000,5610020,"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,creeps in this petty pace from day to day","Macbeth"
"920",5610030,5614110,"to the last syllable of recorded time,","Macbeth"
"921",5615700,5622760,"And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsthe way to dusty death.","Macbeth"
"922",5624030,5634270,"Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow,","Macbeth"
"923",5634410,5639900,"a poor player that struts and frets his hourupon the stage","Macbeth"
"924",5640490,5643290,"then is heard no more.","Macbeth"
"925",5644390,5654680,"It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,signifying nothing.","Macbeth"
"926",5658300,5659780,"Gracious my lord!","Macbeth"
"927",5663160,5668840,"I should report that which I say I saw,but know not how to do it.","Macbeth"
"928",5669910,5673730,"Well, say, sir.","Macbeth"
"929",5674790,5682380,"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,","Macbeth"
"930",5682390,5685420,"the wood began to move.","Macbeth"
"931",5687710,5692960,"If thou speak'st false, upon the next treeshalt thou hang alive,","Macbeth"
"932",5692970,5694310,"till famine cling thee.","Macbeth"
"933",5696540,5702240,"if thy speech be sooth, I care notif thou dost for me as much.","Macbeth"
"934",5705960,5715900,"I pull in resolution, and begin to doubtthe equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth.","Macbeth"
"935",5718730,5721510,"'Fear not, till Birnam wood do come to Dunsinane;'","Macbeth"
"936",5722930,5729530,"and now a wood comes toward Dunsinane.","Macbeth"
"937",5732910,5738770,"Arm, arm, and out! There is nor flying hencenor tarrying here.","Macbeth"
"938",5738980,5742090,"I gin to be aweary of the sun,","Macbeth"
"939",5742700,5747220,"and wish the estate o' the world were now undone.","Macbeth"
"940",5748040,5749520,"Ring the alarum-bell!","Macbeth"
"941",5757460,5758110,"Seyton!","Macbeth"
"942",5770960,5773820,"Blow, wind! come, wrack!","Macbeth"
"943",5774660,5778280,"At least we'll die with harness on our back.","Macbeth"
"944",5817600,5822470,"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose armsare hired to bear their staves","Macbeth"
"945",5824890,5830050,"Either thou, Macbeth, or else my swordwith an unbatter'd edge","Macbeth"
"946",5830060,5831740,"I sheathe again undeeded.","Macbeth"
"947",5831750,5837400,"Our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn.","Macbeth"
"948",5839400,5844160,"Here let you lie till famine and the ague eat you up.","Macbeth"
"949",5845150,5848960,"Were you not forced with those that should be ours,","Macbeth"
"950",5849650,5856120,"We might have met you dareful, beard to beard,and beat you backward home.","Macbeth"
"951",5888980,5891330,"This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.","Macbeth"
"952",5891930,5894170,"We have met with foes that strike beside us.","Macbeth"
"953",5894190,5896800,"What's he that was not born of woman?","Macbeth"
"954",5898330,5901650,"Such a one am I to fear, or none.","Macbeth"
"955",5901660,5903200,"Poor a child(?)","Macbeth"
"956",5907450,5913990,"Thou wast born of woman; but swords I smile at,weapons laugh to scorn,","Macbeth"
"957",5914700,5917480,"Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.","Macbeth"
"958",5917900,5921720,"Tyrant, show thy face!","Macbeth"
"959",5922130,5925670,"If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,","Macbeth"
"960",5925680,5928780,"my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.","Macbeth"
"961",5929080,5931790,"Turn, hell-hound, turn!","Macbeth"
"962",5934060,5938600,"Of all men else I have avoided thee; but get thee back.","Macbeth"
"963",5940070,5944520,"My soul is too much charged withblood of thine already.","Macbeth"
"964",5944700,5948770,"I have no words; my voice is in my sword.","Macbeth"
"965",5961690,5966570,"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,to one of woman born.","Macbeth"
"966",5966580,5968610,"Despair thy charm.","Macbeth"

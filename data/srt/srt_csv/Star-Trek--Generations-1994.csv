"502",2927592,2931177,"and it's a place I've tried very,very hard to forget.","Star Trek: Generations"
"503",2938769,2940437,"What happened to you?","Star Trek: Generations"
"504",2945026,2948028,"It was like being inside joy.","Star Trek: Generations"

"510",2968716,2970550,"None of us wanted to go,","Star Trek: Generations"

"512",2979268,2981186,"And once I realized that wasn'tpossible,","Star Trek: Generations"
"513",2981270,2983063,"I learned to live with that.","Star Trek: Generations"
"514",2983147,2984397,"What about Soran?","Star Trek: Generations"
"515",2984482,2988151,"If he's still obsessed,he could be a very, very dangerous man.","Star Trek: Generations"

"524",3042790,3046126,"This is a remarkablepiece of equipment.","Star Trek: Generations"
"525",3046293,3051965,"-Glad you approve.-It's not very stylish, though, is it?","Star Trek: Generations"
"526",3055136,3060306,"Have you ever considered a prosthesisthat would make you look a little more...","Star Trek: Generations"
"527",3060975,3064144,"How can I say? More normal?","Star Trek: Generations"
"528",3064478,3067480,"-What's normal?-What's normal?","Star Trek: Generations"
"529",3067815,3070150,"Well, that's a good question.","Star Trek: Generations"
"530",3070985,3074821,"Normal is what everyone else isand you are not.","Star Trek: Generations"
"531",3078159,3082203,"Can we just get down to it, please?What do you want?","Star Trek: Generations"

"535",3098721,3103183,"I want to listen to everythingyou know about trilithium.","Star Trek: Generations"
"536",3107605,3112650,"Captain's Log, Stardate 48632.4.Dr. Crusher has informed me","Star Trek: Generations"
"537",3112735,3115820,"that Data's emotion chip has been fusedinto his neural net","Star Trek: Generations"
"538",3115905,3117447,"and cannot be removed.","Star Trek: Generations"
"539",3117531,3119365,"However, she believes he is fit for duty,","Star Trek: Generations"
"540",3119450,3122786,"so I've asked him to join mein Stellar Cartography.","Star Trek: Generations"
"541",3123704,3128041,"According to our information, the ribbonis a conflux of temporal energy","Star Trek: Generations"

"543",3132546,3136216,"It will pass through this sectorin approximately 42 hours.","Star Trek: Generations"
"544",3136383,3138301,"Yes. Guinan was right.","Star Trek: Generations"
"545",3138385,3140720,"She said that Soran was tryingto get back to the ribbon.","Star Trek: Generations"
"546",3140805,3142472,"Now, if that's true,","Star Trek: Generations"
"547",3142556,3145725,"there has to be some connectionwith the Amargosa star.","Star Trek: Generations"
"548",3145810,3149395,"Data, give me a list of anything thatwas affected by the star's destruction,","Star Trek: Generations"
"549",3149480,3151105,"no matter how insignificant.","Star Trek: Generations"
"550",3152441,3155068,"-Data?-Sorry, sir.","Star Trek: Generations"
"551",3158739,3162408,"It will take the computer a few momentsto compile the information.","Star Trek: Generations"

"553",3171794,3177340,"No, sir.I am finding it difficult to concentrate.","Star Trek: Generations"
"554",3178759,3184097,"I believe I am overwhelmedwith feelings of remorse","Star Trek: Generations"

"556",3188602,3189936,"What do you mean?","Star Trek: Generations"
"557",3190646,3193273,"I wanted to save Geordi,","Star Trek: Generations"
"558",3194775,3197986,"but I experiencedsomething I did not expect.","Star Trek: Generations"
"559",3200823,3202198,"Fear.","Star Trek: Generations"
"560",3203492,3205118,"I was afraid.","Star Trek: Generations"
"561",3209290,3212750,"According to our current information,the destruction of the Amargosa star","Star Trek: Generations"
"562",3212835,3215587,"has had the following effectsin this sector.","Star Trek: Generations"
"563",3215671,3219799,"Gamma emissionshave increased by .05%.","Star Trek: Generations"
"564",3220009,3223803,"The Starship Bozeman was forcedto make a course correction.","Star Trek: Generations"
"565",3223971,3225263,"Ambient magnetic fields...","Star Trek: Generations"
"566",3225347,3229309,"Wait. The Bozeman,why would it make a course correction?","Star Trek: Generations"
"567",3229476,3231102,"The destruction of the Amargosa star","Star Trek: Generations"
"568",3231186,3234439,"has altered the gravitational forcesthroughout this sector.","Star Trek: Generations"
"569",3234523,3236733,"As a result,any ship passing through this region","Star Trek: Generations"
"570",3236817,3239360,"would have to makea minor course correction.","Star Trek: Generations"
"571",3239486,3243489,"A minor course correction.Where's the ribbon now?","Star Trek: Generations"
"572",3253500,3257337,"-This is its current position.-Can you project its course?","Star Trek: Generations"
"573",3262551,3264010,"Captain.","Star Trek: Generations"
"574",3268182,3272644,"I cannot continue with this investigation.I wish to be deactivated","Star Trek: Generations"
"575",3272728,3275647,"until Dr. Crusher can removethe emotion chip.","Star Trek: Generations"
"576",3275731,3277649,"Are you having some kindof malfunction?","Star Trek: Generations"
"577",3277733,3282445,"No, sir. I simply do not have the abilityto control these emotions.","Star Trek: Generations"
"578",3283364,3286532,"Data, I have nothing but sympathyfor what you are feeling,","Star Trek: Generations"
"579",3287034,3288785,"but right now, I need you to...","Star Trek: Generations"
"580",3288869,3291704,"Sir, I no longer want these emotions!","Star Trek: Generations"
"581",3292039,3295375,"Deactivating meis the only viable solution.","Star Trek: Generations"
"582",3295459,3300380,"Part of having feelings is learningto integrate them into your life, Data,","Star Trek: Generations"
"583",3300589,3301881,"learning to live with them","Star Trek: Generations"
"584",3302049,3303716,"-no matter what the circumstances.-Sir, I cannot!","Star Trek: Generations"
"585",3303801,3305760,"You will not be deactivated.","Star Trek: Generations"
"586",3306387,3307804,"You're an officer on board this ship,","Star Trek: Generations"

"588",3312059,3313309,"Yes, sir.","Star Trek: Generations"
"589",3317231,3318898,"I will try, sir.","Star Trek: Generations"
"590",3323320,3326406,"Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data,","Star Trek: Generations"
"591",3327408,3329909,"and courage can be an emotion, too.","Star Trek: Generations"
"592",3330953,3333913,"Now, can you project the courseof the ribbon?","Star Trek: Generations"
"593",3334665,3336249,"I believe so.","Star Trek: Generations"
"594",3341171,3342922,"Enhance grid 9-A.","Star Trek: Generations"
"595",3346260,3348678,"Where was the Amargosa star?","Star Trek: Generations"
"596",3352307,3354726,"Now, you said that whenthe Amargosa star was destroyed,","Star Trek: Generations"
"597",3354810,3357061,"it affected the gravitational forcesin this sector.","Star Trek: Generations"
"598",3357146,3359313,"Now, did the computertake that into account","Star Trek: Generations"
"599",3359481,3361274,"when it projectedthe course of the ribbon?","Star Trek: Generations"
"600",3361358,3364318,"No, sir.I will make the appropriate adjustments.","Star Trek: Generations"
"601",3367781,3371451,"That's what Soran's doing.He's changing the course of the ribbon.","Star Trek: Generations"
"602",3372286,3377290,"But why?Why would he try to change its path?","Star Trek: Generations"
"603",3377958,3380460,"Why doesn't he just fly into itwith a ship?","Star Trek: Generations"
"604",3380627,3383087,"Our records show that every shipwhich has approached the ribbon","Star Trek: Generations"
"605",3383172,3386507,"has either been destroyedor severely damaged.","Star Trek: Generations"
"606",3389136,3393139,"He can't get to the ribbon, so he's tryingto make the ribbon come to him.","Star Trek: Generations"
"607",3393348,3397685,"Data, does it pass nearto any M-Class planets?","Star Trek: Generations"
"608",3398228,3401647,"Yes, sir.There are two in the Veridian system.","Star Trek: Generations"
"609",3402399,3406527,"Well, it gets close to Veridian III,but not close enough.","Star Trek: Generations"
"610",3407029,3411657,"Data, what would happento the ribbon's course","Star Trek: Generations"
"611",3411825,3414911,"if Soran destroyedthe Veridian star itself?","Star Trek: Generations"
"612",3419833,3421501,"That's where he's going.","Star Trek: Generations"
"613",3422669,3424504,"It should be noted, sir,","Star Trek: Generations"
"614",3424880,3427840,"that the collapse of the Veridian starwould produce a shock wave","Star Trek: Generations"
"615",3428008,3430676,"similar to the one we observedat Amargosa.","Star Trek: Generations"
"616",3430928,3433596,"Destroying all the planets in this system.","Star Trek: Generations"
"617",3436225,3438518,"Veridian III is uninhabited.","Star Trek: Generations"

"622",3455202,3458204,"Set a course for the Veridian system,maximum warp.","Star Trek: Generations"
"623",3484231,3487233,"Did you get anything from the human?","Star Trek: Generations"
"624",3487317,3490653,"No. His heart just wasn't in it.","Star Trek: Generations"
"625",3492239,3495241,"We have entered orbit of Veridian III.","Star Trek: Generations"

"630",3523812,3526898,"I'll transmitthe decryption sequence to you.","Star Trek: Generations"

"930",5682510,5684011,"Not this time.","Star Trek: Generations"
"931",5685805,5690267,"This time I'm gonna walk upthese stairs, march into that bedroom","Star Trek: Generations"

"944",5872200,5873992,"She isn't real either, is she?","Star Trek: Generations"
"945",5874619,5878455,"Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.","Star Trek: Generations"
"946",5880291,5883126,"You know,maybe this isn't about an empty house.","Star Trek: Generations"
"947",5883211,5887130,"Maybe it's about that empty chairon the Bridge of the Enterprise.","Star Trek: Generations"
"948",5888466,5893470,"Ever since I left Starfleet,I haven't made a difference.","Star Trek: Generations"
"949",5904649,5907359,"-Captain of the Enterprise?-That's right.","Star Trek: Generations"

"961",5954073,5955741,"You could say that.","Star Trek: Generations"
"962",5957702,5958785,"You know, if Spock were here,","Star Trek: Generations"
"963",5958870,5963206,"he'd say that I was an irrational,illogical human being","Star Trek: Generations"
"964",5963291,5965709,"for taking on a mission like that.","Star Trek: Generations"
"965",5968379,5970047,"Sounds like fun.","Star Trek: Generations"
"966",5984395,5988023,"I have re-routed auxiliary powerto the lateral thrusters.","Star Trek: Generations"

"973",6092670,6095338,"Actually, I am familiar with history,Captain,","Star Trek: Generations"
"974",6095423,6098550,"and if I'm not too much mistaken,you're dead.","Star Trek: Generations"
"975",6142011,6143303,"I thought you were headingfor the launcher.","Star Trek: Generations"
"976",6143387,6146389,"I changed my mind.Captain's prerogative.","Star Trek: Generations"
"977",6170665,6172666,"We need that control pad.","Star Trek: Generations"

"997",6608394,6609852,"Our casualties were light,","Star Trek: Generations"
"998",6609937,6614190,"but unfortunately, the Enterprise herselfcannot be salvaged.","Star Trek: Generations"
"999",6614692,6617235,"It has been extremely difficult,Counselor.","Star Trek: Generations"
"1000",6617319,6621197,"Well, then, why did you decidenot to remove the emotion chip?","Star Trek: Generations"
"1001",6621282,6625952,"At first, I was unprepared forthe unpredictable nature of emotions.","Star Trek: Generations"
"1002",6626704,6631457,"However, having experienced261 distinct emotional states,","Star Trek: Generations"
"1003",6631917,6634794,"I believe I have learnedto control my feelings.","Star Trek: Generations"

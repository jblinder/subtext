"2",314896,318899,"there's very little of the midbrainthat we can actually see.","Young Frankenstein"
"3",318985,322069,"Yet, as I demonstratedin my lecture last week,","Young Frankenstein"
"4",322154,329036,"if the under aspects of the temporal lobesare gently pulled apart,","Young Frankenstein"
"5",329120,333831,"the upper portion of the stemof the brain can be seen.","Young Frankenstein"
"6",333915,340129,"This so-called brainstemconsists of the midbrain,","Young Frankenstein"
"7",340213,345343,"a rounded protrusion called the pons,","Young Frankenstein"

"10",353269,357439,"and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.","Young Frankenstein"
"11",357523,360192,"Are there any questionsbefore we proceed?","Young Frankenstein"
"12",360276,362610,"I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.","Young Frankenstein"
"13",365156,367449,"That's Fronkonsteen.","Young Frankenstein"
"14",367533,369742,"I beg your pardon?","Young Frankenstein"
"15",369826,373579,"My name. It's pronounced ""Fronkonsteen"".","Young Frankenstein"
"16",373663,376540,"But aren't you the grandsonof the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,","Young Frankenstein"
"17",376625,382547,"who dug up freshly buried corpsesand transformed dead components into...","Young Frankenstein"
"18",382632,385384,"Yes, yes. Yes.","Young Frankenstein"
"19",385468,388512,"We all know what he did.","Young Frankenstein"
"20",388596,394058,"But I'd rather be rememberedfor my own small contributions to science","Young Frankenstein"
"21",394143,397728,"and not because of my accidentalrelationship","Young Frankenstein"
"22",397814,401733,"to a famous... cuckoo.","Young Frankenstein"
"23",405112,407781,"Now, if you don't mind,can we have your question?","Young Frankenstein"
"24",407865,411492,"Well, sir, I'm not sureI understand the distinction between","Young Frankenstein"
"25",411576,414495,"reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.","Young Frankenstein"
"26",414579,418290,"Good. Since our lab work todayis a demonstration of just that distinction,","Young Frankenstein"
"27",418375,420877,"why don't we proceed?","Young Frankenstein"
"28",430637,434557,"Mr Hilltop here,with whom I have never worked","Young Frankenstein"

"31",441606,446026,"Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feetand stand beside this table?","Young Frankenstein"
"32",455913,457997,"Nice hopping.","Young Frankenstein"
"33",460084,462461,"Mr Hilltop,","Young Frankenstein"
"34",462545,467382,"would you raise your left knee, please?","Young Frankenstein"
"35",470386,473805,"You have just witnesseda voluntary nerve impulse.","Young Frankenstein"
"36",473889,476975,"It begins as a stimulusfrom the cerebral cortex,","Young Frankenstein"
"37",477058,480312,"passes through the brainstemand to the muscles involved.","Young Frankenstein"
"38",480396,483273,"Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.","Young Frankenstein"
"39",483357,488778,"Reflex movements are thosewhich are made independently of the will,","Young Frankenstein"
"40",488862,491363,"but are carried out along pathwayswhich pass between","Young Frankenstein"
"41",491449,495117,"the peripheral nervous systemand the central nervous system.","Young Frankenstein"
"42",495202,498454,"You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch.","Young Frankenstein"
"43",498538,501540,"We are not aware of these impulses.","Young Frankenstein"
"44",501625,505252,"Neither do we intend themto carry out our contraction of muscles.","Young Frankenstein"
"45",505338,508005,"Yet, as you can see,they work by themselves.","Young Frankenstein"
"46",508089,512469,"But what if we block the nerve impulseby simply applying local pressure,","Young Frankenstein"
"47",512552,515471,"which can be donewith any ordinary metal clamp","Young Frankenstein"
"48",515556,521477,"just at the swellingon the posterior nerve roots","Young Frankenstein"
"49",521562,524730,"for, say... five or six seconds?","Young Frankenstein"
"50",529986,533697,"Why, you mother-grabbing bastard.","Young Frankenstein"
"51",533783,536784,"As you can see,all communication is shut off.","Young Frankenstein"
"52",539913,543457,"In spite of our mechanical magnificence,","Young Frankenstein"
"53",543543,548712,"if it were not for this continuous streamof motor impulses,","Young Frankenstein"
"54",548798,554302,"we would collapselike a bunch of broccoli.","Young Frankenstein"
"55",559767,562561,"In conclusion, it should be noted...","Young Frankenstein"
"56",562644,565437,"- Give him an extra dollar.- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.","Young Frankenstein"
"57",565523,571903,"..that any more than common injuryto the nerve root is always serious.","Young Frankenstein"
"58",571988,575115,"Because once a nerve fibre is severed,","Young Frankenstein"
"59",575198,579911,"there is no way, in heaven or on earth,","Young Frankenstein"
"60",579995,582831,"to regenerate life back into it.","Young Frankenstein"

"63",588421,590462,"- Fronkonsteen...- Yes?","Young Frankenstein"
"64",590548,595509,"Isn't it true that Darwin preserveda piece of vermicelli in a glass case","Young Frankenstein"
"65",595595,597636,"until, by some extraordinary means,","Young Frankenstein"
"66",597721,601557,"it actually began to movewith a voluntary motion?","Young Frankenstein"
"67",601642,605352,"Are you speaking of the wormor the spaghetti?","Young Frankenstein"
"68",606855,608940,"Why, the worm, sir.","Young Frankenstein"
"69",609024,613445,"Yes. It seems to me I did read somethingof that incident when I was a student.","Young Frankenstein"
"70",613528,617323,"But you have to remember that a worm,with very few exceptions,","Young Frankenstein"
"71",617408,620951,"is not a human being.","Young Frankenstein"
"72",621037,624288,"But wasn't that the basisof your grandfather's work, sir?","Young Frankenstein"
"73",624373,626791,"The reanimation of dead tissue?","Young Frankenstein"
"74",626875,630211,"My grandfather was a very sick man.","Young Frankenstein"
"75",630296,634758,"But as a Fronkonsteen,aren't you the least bit curious about it?","Young Frankenstein"
"76",634841,639261,"Doesn't bringing back to life what wasonce dead hold any intrigue for you?","Young Frankenstein"
"77",639346,644267,"You are talking aboutthe nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind.","Young Frankenstein"
"78",644351,646144,"Dead is dead.","Young Frankenstein"
"79",646227,648980,"But look at what has been donewith hearts and kidneys.","Young Frankenstein"
"80",649065,651941,"Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys.","Young Frankenstein"
"81",652025,654360,"I'm talking aboutthe central nervous system.","Young Frankenstein"
"82",654445,658239,"- But, sir...- I am a scientist, not a philosopher!","Young Frankenstein"
"83",658323,660825,"You have more chanceof reanimating this scalpel","Young Frankenstein"
"84",660909,663202,"than of mending a broken nervous system.","Young Frankenstein"
"85",663287,668249,"- But what about your grandfather's work?- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!","Young Frankenstein"
"86",669960,672211,"I am not interested in death.","Young Frankenstein"

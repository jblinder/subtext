"281",1939859,1942611,"It didn't go down too good.It's the main event for him.","Bullitt"
"282",1942695,1944902,"You know,the Senate Subcommittee hearing.","Bullitt"
"283",1944989,1947611,"He can't produce the big surprisehe promised everyone.","Bullitt"
"284",1947700,1950867,"He may try to make up some mileageby laying it on us.","Bullitt"
"285",1952497,1954573,"Play it by the book from now on.","Bullitt"
"286",1956334,1958576,"Does Chalmers run the case, or do I?","Bullitt"

"296",2045717,2047045,"I'm Walter Chalmers.","Bullitt"
"297",2047135,2050919,"Is there any possibility of my gettinga deposition from Ross before Monday?","Bullitt"
"298",2051014,2055011,"That's impossible to say at this time.He may remain in shock.","Bullitt"
"299",2056227,2059264,"I thank you for doing all you can, Doctor.","Bullitt"
"300",2062025,2063519,"Get the supervisor.","Bullitt"

"303",2081253,2083079,"Who else knew where he was?","Bullitt"
"304",2084089,2085713,"What are you implying?","Bullitt"
"305",2086049,2089750,"They knew where to look for himand they used your name to get in.","Bullitt"
"306",2092514,2095432,"Are you suggestingI disclosed his whereabouts?","Bullitt"
"307",2095851,2097049,"Somebody did.","Bullitt"
"308",2097728,2099555,"And it didn't come from us.","Bullitt"
"309",2100189,2101849,"That's hardly the issue.","Bullitt"
"310",2103734,2105358,"Well, it certainly is.","Bullitt"
"311",2107154,2109823,"I've got an officer with a family.","Bullitt"
"312",2111367,2113276,"And he's shot up pretty bad.","Bullitt"
"313",2113702,2114865,"Mm hmm.","Bullitt"
"314",2114954,2117326,"And I've got a witness who can't talk.","Bullitt"
"315",2118624,2121993,"I want to know about Ross.What was the deal you made with him?","Bullitt"
"316",2122086,2123082,"Deal?","Bullitt"
"317",2125631,2128549,"Lieutenant, don't tryto evade the responsibility.","Bullitt"
"318",2129510,2132179,"In your parlance, you blew it.","Bullitt"
"319",2132763,2135433,"You knew the significanceof his testimony.","Bullitt"
"320",2135516,2138719,"Yet you failed to takeadequate measures to protect him.","Bullitt"
"321",2139187,2141808,"So to you it was a job. No more.","Bullitt"
"322",2142940,2147483,"Were it more, and you had the dedicationI was led to believe...","Bullitt"
"323",2148196,2149987,"You believe what you want.","Bullitt"
"324",2150323,2153490,"You work your side of the streetand I'll work mine.","Bullitt"
"325",2158206,2162038,"Lieutenant, I shall personallyofficiate at your public crucifixion...","Bullitt"
"326",2162126,2164796,"...if Ross doesn't recoverduring the course of the hearing...","Bullitt"
"327",2164879,2167335,"...so I can at least present his deposition.","Bullitt"
"328",2167424,2169132,"And, I assure you...","Bullitt"
"329",2169217,2172218,"...I shall not suffer the consequenceof your incompetence.","Bullitt"
"330",2172304,2174343,"And even if there wasn't any...","Bullitt"
"331",2175348,2178682,"...I'm rather certainI can prove negligence on your part.","Bullitt"
"332",2184024,2186016,"There may be another attempt on his life.","Bullitt"
"333",2186109,2189525,"I'll be back in the morning,with my people.","Bullitt"
"334",2192699,2194608,"Thank you, Doctor.","Bullitt"
"335",2203210,2205582,"I'd like to have Dr. Willard replaced.","Bullitt"
"336",2205671,2207829,"I think he's too young and inexperienced.","Bullitt"
"337",2207923,2209334,"I'd prefer my surgeon.","Bullitt"
"338",2209425,2210705,"Inform the administrator.","Bullitt"
"339",2210801,2212794,"But Dr. Willard is one of our...","Bullitt"

"345",2265190,2267182,"Could you please tell mewhere I can find him?","Bullitt"
"346",2267275,2269481,"Why don't you try at the reception desk?","Bullitt"
"347",2269569,2271063,"There's no one there.","Bullitt"
"348",2271154,2274321,"He could be up onthe second floor in the emergency room.","Bullitt"
"349",2274407,2276483,"Thanks, Doctor.","Bullitt"
"350",2283041,2284500,"Yes?","Bullitt"

"352",2294428,2295507,"Thank you.","Bullitt"
"353",2296930,2297712,"Yes?","Bullitt"
"354",2297806,2300475,"Dr. Kenner. This probably isn't important...","Bullitt"
"355",2300767,2302890,"...but a man asked mewhether a relative of his...","Bullitt"
"356",2302978,2304603,"...with a gunshot woundwas in the hospital.","Bullitt"
"357",2304688,2306894,"I thought you should know about it.","Bullitt"
"358",2307983,2310189,"Was he about 5 foot 10? Gray hair?","Bullitt"
"359",2310444,2313231,"I'm afraid I told himthat he was on the second floor.","Bullitt"

"434",3104835,3107077,"...some medical complicationas regard to my witness.","Bullitt"
"435",3107170,3110006,"I'm afraid I'll have to foregothat bedside picture...","Bullitt"
"436",3110090,3113126,"...as much as it would've compensatedfor his inability to testify tomorrow.","Bullitt"
"437",3113218,3116136,"But, in all decency,I can hardly force the issue.","Bullitt"
"438",3117139,3119381,"Does this meanyour surprise witness...","Bullitt"

"1363",4548793,4550502,"- The guy with the broom?- Mmm-hmm.","Date Night"
"1364",4550587,4554173,"The Tripplehorns may have stolenthe flash drive from Miletto,","Date Night"
"1365",4554257,4555759,"but they were blackmailing the DA.","Date Night"
"1366",4555842,4558220,"That's ambitious for those two dirtbags.","Date Night"
"1367",4558845,4559887,"Doesn't even matter now, though,","Date Night"
"1368",4559971,4563057,"because the computer sticky thingis at the bottom of the East River,","Date Night"
"1369",4563141,4566310,"which is where we'll beif those cops catch up with us.","Date Night"
"1370",4566561,4569146,"Okay, you knowI'm not so good with complicated plots,","Date Night"

"1378",4586498,4589833,"Okay. Let me... Okay,let me break it down for you, all righty?","Date Night"
"1379",4589918,4593212,"That guy over there.Let's just say that guy is Crenshaw.","Date Night"
"1380",4593296,4595422,"He's a DA. He's a good guy.","Date Night"
"1381",4595507,4599051,"He should be bustingpeople like Joe Miletto.","Date Night"
"1382",4599136,4602346,"He's a gangster. He's a bad guy.He's very bad.","Date Night"
"1383",4602430,4604849,"But Crenshaw can't bust Miletto,","Date Night"
"1384",4604934,4609270,"because Crenshaw goes to Miletto's clubsto get hookers.","Date Night"
"1385",4609854,4613733,"Oh, boy, I hope she's really a hooker.That would be amazing.","Date Night"
"1386",4613818,4617444,"Now, Miletto makesa flash drive implicating Crenshaw.","Date Night"
"1387",4617529,4619488,"Which Taste and Whippit steal","Date Night"
"1388",4619573,4621365,"from The Peppermint Hippo,where she works.","Date Night"
"1389",4621449,4625119,"Right, they steal itso they can blackmail the DA.","Date Night"
"1390",4625621,4628081,"So, those two cops don't work for Miletto.They work for Crenshaw.","Date Night"
"1391",4628164,4629164,"Right.","Date Night"
"1392",4629250,4632293,"And that's why Taste was acting so weirdwhen you mentioned Miletto's name.","Date Night"
"1393",4632377,4635130,"- Right.- Oh, my God, Phil, I totally got this.","Date Night"
"1394",4635213,4637798,"- It has something to do with Crenshaw?- It has...","Date Night"
"1395",4637882,4639967,"Yes, honey, it haseverything to do with Crenshaw.","Date Night"
"1396",4640051,4641552,"That's the key.","Date Night"
"1397",4641636,4643721,"We have to find a way to get to Crenshaw.","Date Night"
"1398",4643805,4647934,"Well, the Tripplehorns got to himat The Peppermint Hippo.","Date Night"
"1399",4648019,4650811,"And we're the Tripplehorns.","Date Night"

"1408",4675796,4679341,"and is probablyin need of significant repair,","Date Night"
"1409",4679425,4681676,"for which I'm sureI'll be able to pay you back","Date Night"

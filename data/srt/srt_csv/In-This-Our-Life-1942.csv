"215",821499,823490,"I'm terribly silly because I'm in love.","In This Our Life"
"216",823668,826967,"I guess you can't be so in lovewithout being silly about it.","In This Our Life"

"233",882226,884990,"Maybe if we'd done it a long time agoin the very beginning.","In This Our Life"
"234",885163,888655,"It was my fault. It seemed likeletting the family down. It's different now.","In This Our Life"

"261",1019497,1023957,"You mean Stanley. The only thing he evergives me is a lecture on my radical views.","In This Our Life"
"262",1024135,1026433,"- How was the meeting?- Oh, dry as dust.","In This Our Life"
"263",1026604,1030973,"It's pretty hard to concentrate on slumclearance and Stanley at the same time.","In This Our Life"

"276",1113724,1115919,"What is it? What's the matter?","In This Our Life"
"277",1116360,1117759,"I thought she might be here.","In This Our Life"
"278",1117928,1120328,"- Who? Who is it you're looking for?- Stanley.","In This Our Life"
"279",1120498,1123399,"But Stanley's never here this earlyunless she stays overnight.","In This Our Life"
"280",1123567,1126297,"I thought that's what she'd done.Spent the night here.","In This Our Life"
"281",1126470,1128233,"But her car is still in the garage.","In This Our Life"
"282",1128406,1129430,"What car, Asa?","In This Our Life"
"283",1130141,1132336,"- What's happened?- I don't know what's happened.","In This Our Life"

"294",1158769,1161897,"- Lf anything's happened to that girl...- William, nothing's happened.","In This Our Life"
"295",1162073,1163802,"You know how impulsive Stanley is.","In This Our Life"
"296",1163974,1168001,"She probably thought of someone to visit,and everyone was asleep when she left.","In This Our Life"
"297",1168179,1171342,"Good gracious, she's ableto take care of herself, isn't she, Asa?","In This Our Life"
"298",1171649,1173617,"What about Craig? Maybe she's with him.","In This Our Life"
"299",1173784,1176844,"No, no. Craig drove me over here.He's waiting outside in his car.","In This Our Life"
"300",1177021,1179114,"This beats anything I ever heard.","In This Our Life"
"301",1179290,1181383,"Poor Lavinia,she must be in a dreadful state.","In This Our Life"
"302",1181559,1184255,"We've got her under drugs.I'm not worried about Lavinia.","In This Our Life"
"303",1184428,1187625,"I'm not even worried about Stanley.It's Roy I'm thinking about.","In This Our Life"
"304",1187798,1189698,"Roy? What's she got to do with it?","In This Our Life"
"305",1189867,1192529,"There's something you're not telling us.I knew that.","In This Our Life"
"306",1192703,1196139,"Yes, that's true.I didn't even want to say it to myself.","In This Our Life"
"307",1196307,1197638,"Peter left last night too.","In This Our Life"
"308",1197808,1199901,"What's that? What do you mean?","In This Our Life"
"309",1200077,1204309,"He said that he had to go to the hospitalat Lynchburg, for a consultation.","In This Our Life"
"310",1204482,1207349,"We called the hospitaland they knew nothing at all about it.","In This Our Life"
"311",1208152,1210916,"Oh, so that's how it is.","In This Our Life"
"312",1211088,1213352,"But... But you can't think they're together.","In This Our Life"
"313",1213524,1217324,"You... You can't thinkthat she's gone off with Peter.","In This Our Life"
"314",1217495,1218689,"I've stopped thinking.","In This Our Life"
"315",1218863,1222355,"But Stanley couldn't.She... She isn't like that.","In This Our Life"
"316",1222533,1225866,"I don't know what she's like.I don't know what anybody's like.","In This Our Life"
"317",1226036,1229563,"She's like all the others, I suppose.The rest of her generation.","In This Our Life"
"318",1229740,1234871,"No scruples, no religion, nothing.By heaven, Charlotte, if a niece of mine...","In This Our Life"
"319",1235045,1237377,"You mustn't get excited,you'll make yourself sick.","In This Our Life"
"320",1237548,1240517,"After what I've done for that girl.After what I've done.","In This Our Life"
"321",1240684,1242675,"It doesn't make much difference,does it...","In This Our Life"
"322",1242853,1244616,"...when a person wants something else.","In This Our Life"
"323",1250895,1254888,"She's not there.They don't know anything.","In This Our Life"
"324",1259103,1263403,"We'd better drive straight home.It's almost an hour since we left.","In This Our Life"
"325",1263574,1265940,"She may be back by now.","In This Our Life"
"326",1267545,1269604,"You know,anything could have happened.","In This Our Life"
"327",1269780,1273341,"She might suddenly have taken itinto her mind to visit somebody.","In This Our Life"
"328",1273517,1276077,"Peter may have gone someplace else.","In This Our Life"
"329",1276253,1279814,"It's conceivable that two peoplecould leave a house on the same night...","In This Our Life"
"330",1279990,1282584,"...and not necessarily go together.","In This Our Life"
"331",1293003,1295494,"- Aren't you coming in?- What for?","In This Our Life"
"332",1295673,1296901,"I guess you're right.","In This Our Life"
"333",1297074,1298905,"But don't do anything foolish, Craig.","In This Our Life"

"339",1326270,1331367,"- I guess I've just been hoping that...- You can stop hoping. Mother got a letter.","In This Our Life"
"340",1331542,1336241,"- Oh, then they... They...- Yes, they did.","In This Our Life"
"341",1336413,1339246,"You didn't expect anything else, did you?","In This Our Life"
"342",1339516,1343043,"- What did Stanley say?- Just what they say in books.","In This Our Life"
"343",1343220,1346280,"""I'm sorry to hurt Roy and Craig.Peter and I had to be together.","In This Our Life"

"350",1363407,1366342,"What are you going to do?Are you going to let them...?","In This Our Life"
"351",1366510,1369377,"I'll never stand in their way.Craig's a lawyer.","In This Our Life"
"352",1369546,1371411,"He may be glad to arrange it.","In This Our Life"
"353",1371582,1373777,"Oh, I can't bear to hear you talk like that.","In This Our Life"
"354",1373951,1376476,"We have to talk the way we feel.That's the way I feel.","In This Our Life"

"359",1389600,1391966,"Father, I don't like this hat anymore.","In This Our Life"
"360",1392136,1394969,"I saw one yesterdayin a show window downtown.","In This Our Life"

"364",1404415,1410320,"Be soft, like you?No. I'll go out and get what I want.","In This Our Life"
"365",1410487,1412216,"The way Stanley gets what she wants.","In This Our Life"

"1146",4294179,4296306,"I know it's awful, but it isn't your fault.","In This Our Life"
"1147",4296481,4298210,"But it was. I mean, in a way it was.","In This Our Life"
"1148",4298383,4300476,"Because, you see,I'd come in from a drive...","In This Our Life"
"1149",4300652,4304179,"...and instead of taking the carto the garage as I usually do...","In This Our Life"

"1177",4378163,4381724,"But it was my carand that makes it my responsibility.","In This Our Life"
"1178",4381900,4386132,"- You don't have to do anything about it.- I think, first of all, I'll go to Parry's mother.","In This Our Life"

"1185",4410662,4413358,"Child, this seems hard to say.","In This Our Life"

"1196",4442594,4444892,"Why didn't he tell the police?I don't understand.","In This Our Life"
"1197",4445730,4448130,"The police just come and took him off.","In This Our Life"

"1199",4455674,4457505,"Minerva, you wouldn't say that unless...","In This Our Life"

"1202",4464516,4466143,"Not even Parry.","In This Our Life"
"1203",4466851,4469012,"Oh, Minerva, I believe you.","In This Our Life"
"1204",4469187,4471655,"I'll go and get Mr. Craig right away.","In This Our Life"
"1205",4471823,4472983,"We'll do all we can.","In This Our Life"
"1206",4474025,4475754,"Yes, ma'am.","In This Our Life"
"1207",4491343,4493971,"- Craig, I've just been to see Minerva.- Yes? What about?","In This Our Life"
"1208",4494145,4497273,"- Parry had nothing to do with the accident.- What do you mean?","In This Our Life"
"1209",4497449,4499440,"Just that.He was at home when it happened.","In This Our Life"
"1210",4499617,4501710,"Minerva told me and I believe her.","In This Our Life"
"1211",4501886,4504548,"Craig, you're his lawyer.Parry's put his trust in you.","In This Our Life"
"1212",4504723,4508250,"- You've got to get him out of this.- No, I'm not his lawyer.","In This Our Life"
"1213",4509260,4511820,"I'm not gonna handle the case.I couldn't get him off.","In This Our Life"
"1214",4511997,4516661,"Yes, the evidence would be bad if Stanleywere telling the truth but she isn't.","In This Our Life"
"1215",4516901,4519734,"- She wouldn't lie?- She has before.","In This Our Life"
"1216",4520005,4524032,"Oh, but not about a thing like this.She may be wild, but she has feelings.","In This Our Life"
"1217",4524209,4526143,"She wouldn't set out to hurt anybody.","In This Our Life"
"1218",4526311,4528279,"No, all she wants is to be happy.","In This Our Life"
"1219",4528446,4530380,"No matter what it costs somebody else.","In This Our Life"
"1220",4530949,4532974,"- She's young.- So is Parry.","In This Our Life"
"1221",4533151,4536382,"Just because of what Stanley did to us,you mustn't misjudge her now.","In This Our Life"
"1222",4536554,4539022,"Letting a boy sufferfor something he didn't do.","In This Our Life"
"1223",4539190,4541715,"You mustn't accuse Stanleyof anything so terrible.","In This Our Life"
"1224",4541893,4545192,"After all, she is your own sister.You mustn't forget that.","In This Our Life"
"1225",4545363,4547194,"I mustn't let you forget it.","In This Our Life"
"1226",4547365,4552325,"Is all this defense because Stanley'smy sister or because she's Stanley?","In This Our Life"
"1227",4552904,4554895,"No, don't answer that.","In This Our Life"
"1228",4555073,4556836,"I don't want to know.","In This Our Life"
"1229",4614666,4617464,"Oh, Roy. How about a Scotch?I've got a new bottle.","In This Our Life"
"1230",4619370,4622430,"- No.- No? Why not?","In This Our Life"
"1231",4632383,4634442,"I could dance all day and all night.","In This Our Life"
"1232",4634619,4636917,"Then you wouldn't need to drive fast,would you?","In This Our Life"
"1233",4637222,4639850,"- It's the same thing, isn't it?- Why do you say that?","In This Our Life"
"1234",4640024,4641753,"You do drive fast, don't you?","In This Our Life"
"1235",4641926,4644394,"Peter said I was the best driverhe ever saw.","In This Our Life"
"1236",4644562,4647087,"- Peter said?- Yes.","In This Our Life"
"1237",4652504,4654699,"What do you thinkis going to happen to Parry?","In This Our Life"
"1238",4655106,4657301,"Craig will get him offwith a light sentence.","In This Our Life"
"1239",4657475,4660410,"Then you're certain it was Parrywho was in the accident?","In This Our Life"
"1240",4660578,4662512,"Naturally. Who else would it be?","In This Our Life"
"1241",4668786,4671619,"Stanley, what time last eveningdid Parry pick up the car?","In This Our Life"
"1242",4672023,4676050,"Oh, I got home about 7:00.It must have been some time after that.","In This Our Life"
"1243",4676227,4678024,"Where had you been?","In This Our Life"
"1244",4678396,4679829,"What business is it of yours?","In This Our Life"
"1245",4679998,4684230,"Why do you keep asking me questions?I've told you all I know about it.","In This Our Life"
"1246",4684569,4687436,"Stanley. Stanley.","In This Our Life"
"1247",4688273,4690173,"We can't always help what we do.","In This Our Life"
"1248",4690341,4693902,"The awful thing is not to face whatwe've done, to make someone else face it.","In This Our Life"
"1249",4694279,4695974,"What has that got to do with me?","In This Our Life"
"1250",4696147,4698638,"For your own sake,please tell me the truth.","In This Our Life"
"1251",4698816,4701182,"What truth? What are you talking about?","In This Our Life"
"1252",4701352,4703946,"I'm talking about a womanin the hospital badly hurt...","In This Our Life"
"1253",4704122,4706181,"...to be told her little girl is dead.","In This Our Life"
"1254",4706357,4709087,"Well, it wasn't my fault.You said it wasn't my fault.","In This Our Life"
"1255",4709260,4712093,"I can't help what...What someone else does.","In This Our Life"
"1256",4712530,4716022,"Minerva says that Parry wasn't outof the house last evening after 6:00.","In This Our Life"
"1257",4716201,4718829,"Whenever they're in a tight spotthey lie for each other.","In This Our Life"
"1258",4719003,4720334,"She says you called Parry...","In This Our Life"
"1259",4720505,4723201,"...and told him you didn'twant the car washed.","In This Our Life"
"1260",4723374,4724534,"She lied.","In This Our Life"
"1261",4725310,4727778,"- Parry says the same thing.- I know that.","In This Our Life"
"1262",4727946,4730005,"He told Craig that.Craig didn't believe him.","In This Our Life"
"1263",4730181,4732172,"- Nobody believes him.- I believe him.","In This Our Life"
"1264",4733351,4735216,"Oh, you do?","In This Our Life"
"1265",4735720,4738314,"If you believe him,it's because you want to believe him.","In This Our Life"
"1266",4738489,4741117,"You hate me and that's your wayof getting back at me.","In This Our Life"
"1267",4741292,4744591,"You wanted the truth. All right,here it is and I hope you like it.","In This Our Life"
"1268",4744762,4747196,"You hated me ever since... Since Peter.","In This Our Life"
"1269",4747365,4751301,"You put on the forgiveness act but youweren't fooling me. You were jealous.","In This Our Life"
"1270",4751469,4754336,"You can't stand the sight of mebecause you couldn't hold him.","In This Our Life"
"1271",4754505,4756996,"- Stanley.- And it's not only Peter. It's Craig too.","In This Our Life"
"1272",4757175,4760110,"You're afraid I could get him back,and I could if I wanted him.","In This Our Life"
"1273",4760278,4763736,"All I have to do is lift my little finger.That's why you're tormenting me.","In This Our Life"
"1274",4763915,4766941,"Because you're jealousand you're getting revenge.","In This Our Life"
"1275",4777895,4779988,"Hello, Roy. Stanley here?","In This Our Life"
"1276",4780164,4781927,"She's in there.","In This Our Life"

"1278",4786404,4789464,"We'd better get your story on paperwhile it's fresh in your mind.","In This Our Life"
"1279",4789641,4792735,"Suppose we go down to my officeand make out an affidavit.","In This Our Life"
"1280",4792977,4795411,"- Right now?- Yes, right now.","In This Our Life"
"1281",4795880,4799782,"Well, whatever you say.","In This Our Life"
"1282",4800351,4805084,"Anyway, it'll be nice to get outof this house. It's so gloomy here.","In This Our Life"
"1283",4805957,4809620,"- See you later, Roy, if you're here.- I'll be here.","In This Our Life"
"1284",4816034,4818002,"But, Craig, this isn't your office.","In This Our Life"

"1290",4834919,4837387,"Well, I thought we'd stopand see Parry on the way.","In This Our Life"
"1291",4837555,4841355,"If I brought him face to face with you,he might break down and tell the truth.","In This Our Life"
"1292",4843428,4844452,"All right, then.","In This Our Life"
"1293",4845129,4846653,"Come on.","In This Our Life"

"1313",4914899,4916594,"It ain't no use.","In This Our Life"
"1314",4916768,4919601,"It ain't no use in this world.","In This Our Life"

"1317",4927178,4929339,"Just say you took the car.","In This Our Life"
"1318",4929514,4934076,"That it was a lovely evening and you wentfor a drive and that there was an accident.","In This Our Life"
"1319",4934252,4936152,"That's all you've got to say.","In This Our Life"
"1320",4936821,4940222,"And we'll do everything,everything we can to get you out.","In This Our Life"
"1321",4940391,4944418,"My Uncle William. He's got moneyand influence and I'll go to him.","In This Our Life"
"1322",4944595,4948463,"And then when you get out,why, we'll all give you a fresh start.","In This Our Life"
"1323",4948633,4951295,"But, Parry, if you go on lying like this...","In This Our Life"

"1328",4969187,4971348,"It ain't no use.","In This Our Life"
"1329",4971522,4974355,"It ain't no use in this world.","In This Our Life"
"1330",4974859,4978192,"My telling the truth ain't gonna help me.","In This Our Life"
"1331",4978463,4980624,"There ain't nothing gonna help me.","In This Our Life"
"1332",4985937,4989168,"Wouldn't you think the sensible thingto do is to say he took the car?","In This Our Life"
"1333",4989340,4991069,"Then we could help him.","In This Our Life"
"1334",5009227,5010626,"Stanley.","In This Our Life"
"1335",5010795,5013286,"I'd like to make one more stop.","In This Our Life"
"1336",5013631,5015724,"Well, what for?","In This Our Life"

"1338",5020938,5023634,"They must have been flowers she liked...","In This Our Life"
"1339",5023875,5026673,"...so I think you should leave somebefore the funeral.","In This Our Life"
"1340",5027144,5029476,"All right, Craig.I'll order some this afternoon.","In This Our Life"
"1341",5029647,5032115,"No. It would be better if you left them.","In This Our Life"
"1342",5032283,5033375,"More fitting.","In This Our Life"
"1343",5033551,5036019,"But I can't go there, Craig.Why should you ask me to?","In This Our Life"
"1344",5036187,5039520,"- What are you trying to do?- I'm trying to get you to tell the truth.","In This Our Life"
"1345",5039924,5042017,"I've told you I don't knowanything about it.","In This Our Life"
"1346",5042193,5045822,"You were driving. It was dusk.You didn't see the woman and the little girl.","In This Our Life"

"1353",5060578,5063547,"- You've gotta help. Tell the truth.- The truth. The truth.","In This Our Life"

"1356",5069887,5072412,"Why are you persecuting her?Who said Stanley...","In This Our Life"
"1357",5072590,5076253,"...had anything to do with the accident?- I did. Or if I didn't, I say it now.","In This Our Life"
"1358",5076427,5079521,"That's a lie. I was right herein this house when it happened.","In This Our Life"
"1359",5079697,5081927,"- I don't believe that.- Tell them, you remember.","In This Our Life"
"1360",5082099,5084033,"Of course, I do. She was up in my room.","In This Our Life"
"1361",5084201,5085998,"- What time was it?- Time? Well...","In This Our Life"
"1362",5086170,5087660,"It was about 7:00, wasn't it?","In This Our Life"
"1363",5087838,5090932,"Yes. I'm sure it was 7because Stanley brought me my medicine.","In This Our Life"
"1364",5091442,5095435,"Mr. Timberlake,was Stanley here at 7:00 last evening?","In This Our Life"
"1365",5098082,5099413,"No, she wasn't.","In This Our Life"
"1366",5099584,5102519,"- It was after 7 when she telephoned in.- That isn't true.","In This Our Life"
"1367",5102687,5105383,"You're taking Roy's side.You're both against me.","In This Our Life"
"1368",5105556,5107956,"Don't you dare say a thing like that.William will...","In This Our Life"
"1369",5108125,5109990,"I don't care about William.","In This Our Life"
"1370",5110161,5111321,"That's the fact.","In This Our Life"
"1371",5112430,5115558,"All right. It's your word against ours.","In This Our Life"
"1372",5115733,5117860,"Go ahead, tell them I wasn't here.","In This Our Life"
"1373",5118035,5122802,"Tell them I was out in the car instead.Tell the police and see who they'll believe.","In This Our Life"
"1374",5123608,5125303,"Stanley.","In This Our Life"
"1375",5132483,5135509,"You remember this pagefrom my desk calendar?","In This Our Life"

"1383",5158776,5160676,"The bartender remembers you.","In This Our Life"
"1384",5160845,5164713,"Because he wanted to listen to the radioand you kept running the jukebox.","In This Our Life"
"1385",5165750,5167809,"Then you asked what time it was.","In This Our Life"
"1386",5167985,5169043,"And then you left.","In This Our Life"

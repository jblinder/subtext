"468",2254519,2257523,"When she volunteeredfor her sister at the Reaping.","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"

"485",2299400,2301561,"She's still a girl.You made her look 35.","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"

"494",2321760,2323364,"It has to come from her.","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"
"495",2323440,2325407,"That's what people respond to.","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"

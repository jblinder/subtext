"441",2049147,2050375,"What's funny?","Kings Row"

"450",2076941,2079466,"All the time he comes in, then he goes out.","Kings Row"
"451",2079544,2084379,"He wanders all over the place,absentminded and just looks at things.","Kings Row"
"452",2085083,2088450,"- Maybe there is a girl.- It's something more than a girl, madam.","Kings Row"
"453",2088519,2090783,"He's in love with here, with this place.","Kings Row"
"454",2090855,2093483,"I have no idea what you're talking about.","Kings Row"
"455",2093558,2096083,"Madam, I've watched him growevery day of his life.","Kings Row"
"456",2096160,2099186,"I feel, in here,sometimes just what he feels.","Kings Row"
"457",2099464,2103696,"It's this, I think he feels change.","Kings Row"
"458",2104602,2109062,"I think he's afraid something is to happenand he doesn't understand.","Kings Row"
"459",2109140,2112200,"- Anna, you haven't told him.- No, madam.","Kings Row"
"460",2112844,2114471,"He mustn't know, Anna.","Kings Row"
"461",2114545,2116945,"Oh, no, madam, when I think...","Kings Row"
"462",2120518,2122509,"Don't cry, Anna, for me.","Kings Row"
"463",2123454,2125547,"It will be worse for him.","Kings Row"
"464",2129460,2133897,"My troubles are almost overand his are just beginning.","Kings Row"
"465",2135099,2137863,"Growing up is so difficult, Anna.","Kings Row"

"467",2142473,2144634,"The frightening problems.","Kings Row"
"468",2144709,2147678,"The meannessesand the cruelties of the world.","Kings Row"
"469",2148913,2152815,"How often I have wishedthat his mother be lived,","Kings Row"
"470",2153151,2154743,"or his father.","Kings Row"
"471",2155153,2157314,"Or that I were his mother.","Kings Row"
"472",2158589,2163356,"It isn't fair that a young boyshould be brought up by an old woman","Kings Row"
"473",2163861,2167024,"who will leave himwhen he needs her most.","Kings Row"
"474",2169167,2171431,"What's going to happen to him?","Kings Row"

"481",2208239,2210833,"- Digging in?- Oh, hello, Drake.","Kings Row"
"482",2210908,2213342,"Something like that, I guess.What are you doing way out here?","Kings Row"

"488",2229994,2232986,"It's just a feeling I've had lately.Something I can't stop happening,","Kings Row"
"489",2233064,2236124,"that maybe I'm even responsible forin some way.","Kings Row"
"490",2242173,2244266,"She wants to see meat your house again tonight.","Kings Row"
"491",2244342,2246310,"Well, don't you want to?","Kings Row"
"492",2246377,2249278,"I wouldn't say this to anyone else, Drake.","Kings Row"
"493",2249347,2252714,"Ever since we were kids,there's been no one but her.","Kings Row"
"494",2253351,2255842,"Gee, I had no idea.","Kings Row"
"495",2257455,2260481,"Well, then everythingought to be hunky-dory.","Kings Row"
"496",2261158,2262989,"Oh, I get it. Her old man.","Kings Row"
"497",2263060,2264755,"No, no,there's something more to it than that.","Kings Row"
"498",2264829,2267195,"Some mystery about Cassie herself.","Kings Row"
"499",2267265,2269495,"Dr. Tower said something once,","Kings Row"
"500",2270201,2273432,"""Each of us live in multiple worlds.""","Kings Row"
"501",2274105,2275663,"It's like that with her.","Kings Row"
"502",2275740,2277332,"Say, you're getting to bea regular philosopher.","Kings Row"
"503",2277408,2280172,"No, I'm not.I've learnt a lot from Dr. Tower, though.","Kings Row"
"504",2280244,2282508,"- Not enough yet, I guess.- He's crazy, isn't he?","Kings Row"
"505",2282580,2286277,"No, he's brainier than the rest of menin this town put together.","Kings Row"
"506",2286350,2289046,"Well, there's something crazyabout that house.","Kings Row"
"507",2289120,2292681,"I feel like a dog when I go there now.I like him, Drake.","Kings Row"
"508",2293524,2297324,"Yet, when I think about Cassieand the way he makes her live...","Kings Row"
"509",2298396,2300296,"Gosh, I'm all mixed up.","Kings Row"
"510",2312677,2315305,"- Come in, Parris.- Good afternoon, sir.","Kings Row"
"511",2322753,2324687,"Something on your mind?","Kings Row"
"512",2325823,2330419,"Dr. Tower, I'm going to ask you a questionperhaps you won't like answering.","Kings Row"
"513",2330494,2334294,"- Then I shan't answer it.- Is Dr. Gordon a good doctor?","Kings Row"
"514",2335733,2337701,"Not a very a tactful question, young man,","Kings Row"
"515",2337768,2341226,"nor a very ethical onefor a young doctor-to-be to ask.","Kings Row"
"516",2342540,2344508,"Ever since I can rememberI've noticed things.","Kings Row"
"517",2344575,2346634,"When I was just a kid,there was Willy MacIntosh's father","Kings Row"
"518",2346711,2349407,"who died from shockduring an operation without anesthetic.","Kings Row"
"519",2349480,2352244,"There have been other cases,Ludie Simms.","Kings Row"
"520",2352316,2354011,"You know the widowthe men all wink about?","Kings Row"
"521",2354085,2355279,"Dr. Gordon operated on her,","Kings Row"
"522",2355353,2357947,"now one whole side of her faceis horribly paralyzed.","Kings Row"
"523",2358022,2359819,"There've been others.","Kings Row"
"524",2359990,2362458,"Now he's attending my grandmother.","Kings Row"
"525",2363461,2365725,"I can assure youthat in your grandmother's case","Kings Row"
"526",2365796,2367559,"he knows his business.","Kings Row"
"527",2367631,2369963,"I'm glad to hear you say that, sir.","Kings Row"
"528",2370034,2373003,"- Trust my judgment, do you?- I know you know.","Kings Row"
"529",2374472,2376906,"Maybe you're a fool, Parris Mitchell.","Kings Row"
"530",2376974,2379738,"- Like a cup of coffee, my boy?- Yes, sir.","Kings Row"
"531",2380811,2384542,"Parris, I began this work with youwith decided misgivings.","Kings Row"
"532",2384882,2388215,"It's only fair to tell you nowthat I've enjoyed it.","Kings Row"
"533",2388552,2391817,"- Let the devil take the hindmost, eh?- I guess I'll have to, sir.","Kings Row"
"534",2391889,2394687,"Oh, it's not too bada philosophy sometimes.","Kings Row"
"535",2394759,2397728,"- Hope you like your coffee black.- Thank you.","Kings Row"
"536",2399830,2403129,"- Oh, have you read this?- Yes, sir.","Kings Row"
"537",2403200,2405600,"I didn't understand it entirely, I'm afraid.","Kings Row"
"538",2405669,2407296,"Well, it's a new field.","Kings Row"
"539",2407371,2410306,"They've even a new word for it:psychiatry.","Kings Row"
"540",2411375,2412774,"It's something I never thought about.","Kings Row"
"541",2412843,2414708,"I mean, for a doctorto want to cure diseases","Kings Row"
"542",2414779,2416644,"of people's minds instead of their bodies.","Kings Row"
"543",2416714,2419581,"- I suppose it a pretty big field, sir.- Maybe too big.","Kings Row"
"544",2419650,2421709,"Maybe a hundred years off.","Kings Row"
"545",2422386,2425947,"Of course, one never knows.There's a stir in Vienna now.","Kings Row"
"546",2426824,2428655,"I don't want to push youone way or the other,","Kings Row"
"547",2428726,2432162,"but if you are interested,I have some other material.","Kings Row"
"548",2432663,2435393,"You had medieval historyin school this year, didn't you, Parris?","Kings Row"
"549",2435466,2436728,"Yes, sir.","Kings Row"
"550",2437001,2440129,"You should pay some attentionto 12th and 13th centuries.","Kings Row"
"551",2440204,2443640,"A man's discomfort, his real discomfortin this world began not long after then.","Kings Row"
"552",2443707,2445902,"- But I always...- Oh, I know, soap.","Kings Row"
"553",2445976,2448877,"Macadamized roads,dentistry and freedom of speech.","Kings Row"
"554",2448946,2451380,"- Yes, yes, sir.- Negligible factors.","Kings Row"
"555",2451449,2453246,"In the 13th century, man was happier","Kings Row"
"556",2453317,2455615,"and more comfortable in his worldthan he is now.","Kings Row"
"557",2455686,2459178,"I'm speaking of psychic manand his relation with his whole universe.","Kings Row"
"558",2459256,2462350,"I get it, sir. Everything was so simple then.","Kings Row"
"559",2462426,2464656,"That was it, Parris. That was it.","Kings Row"
"560",2464728,2466559,"But now, in this modern,complicated world,","Kings Row"
"561",2466630,2468689,"man breaks down under the strain,the bewilderment,","Kings Row"
"562",2468766,2470597,"disappointment and disillusionment.","Kings Row"
"563",2470668,2473535,"He gets lost, goes crazy, commits suicide.","Kings Row"
"564",2474271,2475898,"I don't know what's going to happento this world","Kings Row"
"565",2475973,2477270,"in the next hundred years or so,","Kings Row"
"566",2477341,2480504,"but I can guarantee youlife isn't going to get any simpler.","Kings Row"
"567",2480578,2483172,"Worry and doubt bring on a belly-ache.","Kings Row"
"568",2483247,2487274,"Mankind's building upthe biggest psychic belly-ache in history.","Kings Row"
"569",2488519,2490248,"I'd better stop this.","Kings Row"
"570",2490321,2493722,"I seem to be in a vein ofepigrammatic sententiousness today.","Kings Row"
"571",2493791,2496282,"I was thinking, as you were talking...","Kings Row"
"572",2496794,2498557,"No, I don't guess I better say it.","Kings Row"
"573",2498629,2500654,"Go ahead, there's no one listening but me.","Kings Row"
"574",2500731,2502528,"Well, you were saying that man gets lost.","Kings Row"
"575",2502600,2505194,"It seems to me that these lost peoplehave kind of fooled themselves","Kings Row"
"576",2505269,2506702,"clear out of the world of reality.","Kings Row"
"577",2506770,2508704,"And the right wayis to fool them right back in again,","Kings Row"
"578",2508772,2510706,"like catching a rabbitthat's strayed out of its pen.","Kings Row"
"579",2510774,2513402,"You get his attention on something elseand he doesn't see the gate","Kings Row"
"580",2513477,2516139,"and the first thing he knowshe's back home again.","Kings Row"
"581",2516213,2519341,"Did you read that phrase somewhere?""Back home again in the pen""?","Kings Row"
"582",2519416,2521782,"No, sir. I must have made it up.","Kings Row"
"583",2523187,2525815,"It won't surprise me, young man,if you become a good doctor.","Kings Row"
"584",2525890,2528552,"Maybe even a brilliant one.Now, you run along home","Kings Row"
"585",2528626,2531959,"and I'll get these entrance applicationsoff to Vienna.","Kings Row"
"586",2533898,2536799,"I've enjoyed this afternoon very much, sir.","Kings Row"
"587",2537001,2539333,"I like your politeness, Parris.","Kings Row"
"588",2539537,2543496,"You're a credit to your grandmother.And you're going to be a credit to me, too.","Kings Row"
"589",2543574,2545337,"I'll try to be, sir.","Kings Row"
"590",2546911,2551007,"If I had a son, I'd want him to beas nearly like you as possible.","Kings Row"
"591",2565029,2567156,"Yeah, yeah, that is good.","Kings Row"
"592",2567231,2569563,"That is better than you know, Parris.","Kings Row"
"593",2569633,2572932,"Such a waste of talentfor you to become a doctor.","Kings Row"
"594",2576040,2577405,"Excuse me.","Kings Row"
"595",2579743,2582712,"- Anna, how is she today?- The same.","Kings Row"
"596",2583714,2585409,"The weather will be cooler soon.","Kings Row"
"597",2585482,2586915,"If you'll excuse me, Professor Berdorff,","Kings Row"
"598",2586984,2589509,"- I don't feel like finishing.- Yeah.","Kings Row"
"599",2593757,2596248,"Dr. Gordon came here twice today.","Kings Row"
"600",2623854,2624980,"Anna.","Kings Row"
"601",2630094,2632961,"- How long has this been necessary?- How stupid, I left it.","Kings Row"
"602",2633030,2634156,"Anna?","Kings Row"
"603",2639403,2641462,"For several weeks, Parris.","Kings Row"
"604",2643841,2646605,"- Cancer?- Yes, Parris.","Kings Row"
"605",2647911,2650812,"Why wasn't I told? Why have I beenkept out of this like a child?","Kings Row"
"606",2650881,2652246,"Madam wished it.","Kings Row"
"607",2652316,2655114,"She wanted you to finish your studieswithout worrying.","Kings Row"
"608",2655185,2656948,"She made me promise.","Kings Row"
"609",2657388,2660357,"She thoughtshe would live through September.","Kings Row"
"610",2661792,2664556,"And she won't? Is that what you mean?","Kings Row"
"611",2665462,2669057,"It's impossible that she could livemore than a few days.","Kings Row"
"612",2670734,2673168,"- Only a few days?- Yes, Parris.","Kings Row"
"613",2705869,2707268,"Parris.","Kings Row"
"614",2709339,2711466,"Oh, Parris, I had to see you.","Kings Row"
"615",2711542,2713271,"Weren't you scared herein the dark by yourself?","Kings Row"
"616",2713343,2715436,"A little. You know I wouldn't havetelephoned just now","Kings Row"
"617",2715512,2717707,"- if it wasn't important.- Well, let's go back to your house?","Kings Row"
"618",2717781,2720375,"No, I had to get out of the house tonight,I couldn't stand it.","Kings Row"
"619",2720451,2724547,"- Cassie, what's the matter?- Can't we just walk here in the trees?","Kings Row"
"620",2728192,2730490,"I never realize how little you aretill I walk with you.","Kings Row"
"621",2730561,2733428,"Oh, you've just gotten to be awfully tall.","Kings Row"
"622",2735566,2739696,"It seems a long time ago sincewe walked home this way from school.","Kings Row"
"623",2740738,2743138,"Look, Parris, the pond.","Kings Row"
"624",2745042,2747374,"I'd forgotten how lovely it was.","Kings Row"
"625",2748145,2751876,"You know something?I used to think of this as our secret lake.","Kings Row"
"626",2751949,2753246,"So did I.","Kings Row"
"627",2754051,2758215,"How odd it is that we should both...Or perhaps it isn't odd at all.","Kings Row"
"628",2761325,2763953,"You'll be going away pretty soon now.","Kings Row"
"629",2765195,2766924,"Yes, I guess so.","Kings Row"
"630",2767598,2769088,"I'll miss you.","Kings Row"
"631",2769833,2771733,"Will you really, Cassie?","Kings Row"
"632",2771802,2775568,"So much I don't knowwhat will become of me.","Kings Row"

"634",2777808,2780675,"Even now,don't say anything you don't mean.","Kings Row"
"635",2780744,2783338,"I don't even know how I feel about you.","Kings Row"
"636",2783413,2785540,"I haven't knownsince the day you came to our house","Kings Row"

"648",2821385,2824912,"Parris, your grandmother is dyingand they don't tell you.","Kings Row"
"649",2824988,2826250,"I thought you ought to know.","Kings Row"
"650",2826323,2829815,"I was afraid of what the sudden shockmight've done to you.","Kings Row"
"651",2829893,2831417,"Oh, darling!","Kings Row"
"652",2831962,2834089,"I guess it's just as badthe way I've told you.","Kings Row"
"653",2834164,2836632,"No, no. It's all right, Cassie.","Kings Row"
"654",2836700,2839328,"I knew.I'm glad you wanted to tell me, though.","Kings Row"
"655",2839403,2842497,"I just won't have anyone at all,Cassie, when...","Kings Row"
"656",2843173,2846574,"- I forget sometimes, how pretty you are.- Oh, Parris.","Kings Row"
"657",2847010,2849274,"- You're crying.- Just a little bit, never mind.","Kings Row"
"658",2849346,2852076,"But I do mind. I mind awfully.","Kings Row"
"659",2852950,2854918,"Oh, why do you have thingshappen to you?","Kings Row"
"660",2854985,2856577,"Why do you have to cry?","Kings Row"
"661",2856653,2858644,"You're the nicest, best.","Kings Row"
"662",2858856,2862451,"Why do any of us have to cry?You or me, what have we done?","Kings Row"
"663",2862526,2864926,"Oh, I hate it. I hate everything.","Kings Row"
"664",2864995,2867589,"I'd hate God if I could.But there's nothing you can reach.","Kings Row"

"666",2869900,2872460,"I want you to hate it, too,whatever hurts us.","Kings Row"

"673",2901765,2905462,"When I come back, maybe somehowthe time will pass quickly.","Kings Row"
"674",2906203,2909138,"When I come back, will you marry me?","Kings Row"
"675",2911108,2915135,"- Cassie, don't you want to marry me?- If I can let you understand.","Kings Row"
"676",2915212,2917339,"- Maybe I do.- No, you don't.","Kings Row"
"677",2917848,2920510,"Not at all. You couldn't.","Kings Row"

"686",2950180,2953149,"Dr. Gordon saidhe couldn't do anything more.","Kings Row"
"687",2953717,2955617,"I thought maybe,","Kings Row"
"688",2955686,2958587,"I hoped it would be overbefore you came in.","Kings Row"
"689",2959423,2960913,"You come now.","Kings Row"

"694",3046276,3049268,"I guess the old barn is big enoughto hold them.","Kings Row"
"695",3049346,3053077,"It's been awfully good of you, Drake,to take me in just now.","Kings Row"
"696",3053150,3057109,"- I can't be any fun to be with.- Well, it's like I always said,","Kings Row"

"701",3086416,3089647,"- It's more fun anyways.- You wouldn't do a thing like that.","Kings Row"
"702",3089719,3091311,"No, I guess not.","Kings Row"

"717",3134931,3138389,"- I asked you if, when I came back, you'd...- Never mind.","Kings Row"
"718",3138468,3139696,"Cassie, if you'd rather, I...","Kings Row"

"732",3180810,3182004,"We'll move out to my place.","Kings Row"
"733",3182078,3184069,"You a farmer? You're gonna be a doctor.","Kings Row"
"734",3184147,3186377,"It's what you've always wantedand what your grandma planned.","Kings Row"
"735",3186449,3189543,"- Kid, if I have to slug you...- Let loose, Drake. I...","Kings Row"
"736",3209673,3211698,"There.Does that look like anything's happened?","Kings Row"
"737",3211775,3214471,"Old Cass was just having a fitabout you going away, that's all.","Kings Row"
"738",3214544,3216375,"All women and girlsact like that sometimes.","Kings Row"
"739",3216446,3218437,"It doesn't mean a thing.","Kings Row"
"740",3219482,3222007,"Just the same, Drake, I'm scared.I don't know why.","Kings Row"
"741",3222085,3225145,"What you need is some sleep.You're worn out and nervous.","Kings Row"
"742",3225222,3228055,"Come on home.You can see Cassie tomorrow.","Kings Row"
"743",3236366,3238766,"Just don't say anything to him about it.","Kings Row"
"744",3238835,3241201,"Here, maybe I better take it up.","Kings Row"
"745",3247510,3248943,"Are you awake, kid?","Kings Row"
"746",3254384,3256409,"Here. Eat your breakfast.","Kings Row"

"749",3264995,3269056,"I've got something to tell you,but you gotta drink your coffee first.","Kings Row"
"750",3269132,3270531,"Tell me now.","Kings Row"
"751",3271434,3273561,"It's something about Cassie.","Kings Row"
"752",3273903,3275461,"Cassie's dead.","Kings Row"
"753",3276039,3280203,"She was killed early last night.I guess shortly after we were there.","Kings Row"
"754",3280277,3281369,"Who?","Kings Row"
"755",3281444,3284413,"Her father killed herand committed suicide.","Kings Row"
"756",3284714,3287205,"- I don't believe it. You...- Now, get a hold of yourself, kid.","Kings Row"
"757",3287284,3288546,"I'll tell you everything I know.","Kings Row"
"758",3288618,3291018,"I heard it first from Esterwhen she came in early this morning","Kings Row"
"759",3291087,3293112,"and I telephoned the Gazetteand confirmed it.","Kings Row"
"760",3293189,3294884,"Cassie was poisoned.","Kings Row"
"761",3294958,3297654,"Quite a bit later, Dr. Tower shot himself.","Kings Row"
"762",3297727,3300389,"He hadn't been dead very longwhen the cook came in and found them.","Kings Row"
"763",3300463,3304661,"He left some kind of letter or letters.I don't know which, the Gazette said.","Kings Row"
"764",3304734,3307703,"I'm going over nowand see what I can find out.","Kings Row"
"765",3307771,3310137,"Yes, that's it, Drake. We've got to go.","Kings Row"
"766",3310206,3312140,"You're not goingif I have to tie you in the cellar.","Kings Row"
"767",3312208,3313641,"- I've got to.- Listen, you fool.","Kings Row"
"768",3313710,3314904,"Cassie was here last night.","Kings Row"
"769",3314978,3317071,"We were probably the last peoplewho saw her alive.","Kings Row"
"770",3317147,3318273,"If you won't think about yourself","Kings Row"
"771",3318348,3319906,"I should thinkyou'd at least want to protect her.","Kings Row"
"772",3319983,3321746,"- Protect her, Drake? I think I've killed her...- Yeah.","Kings Row"
"773",3321818,3323979,"You say that out loud a few timesand somebody'll believe you.","Kings Row"
"774",3324054,3325578,"Then where'll your future in this townbe shot to?","Kings Row"
"775",3325655,3328055,"- I don't care.- Listen, kid, I know how you feel.","Kings Row"
"776",3328124,3331719,"I know what you'd like to do,but just let me go first. That's all I ask.","Kings Row"
"777",3331795,3333695,"I'll come back and tell you everything.","Kings Row"
"778",3333763,3336596,"Then you can dowhatever you feel is right.","Kings Row"
"779",3343606,3346097,"- Hey, McHugh.- Friend of the family.","Kings Row"
"780",3349612,3351910,"- Find anything more?- Not yet.","Kings Row"
"781",3351981,3353676,"Darndest mystery.","Kings Row"
"782",3354484,3356884,"Hello, Sam.Good afternoon, Colonel Skeffington.","Kings Row"
"783",3356953,3359148,"Well, what do you want here, Drake?This is no time...","Kings Row"
"784",3359222,3360849,"Wait a minute, Sam.","Kings Row"
"785",3360924,3362949,"Just as well you came by.","Kings Row"
"786",3363159,3366219,"Where's Parris Mitchell?Still at your house?","Kings Row"
"787",3366296,3367490,"Yes, sir.","Kings Row"
"788",3367564,3371159,"Ask him to be kind enough to wait theretill I can see him.","Kings Row"
"789",3371234,3374829,"- May I ask why, sir?- I want to talk to him.","Kings Row"
"790",3377173,3379004,"He isn't the one you want to talk to.","Kings Row"
"791",3379075,3380508,"What's that?","Kings Row"
"792",3382245,3383735,"Anything new?","Kings Row"
"793",3384381,3386372,"Just something about the girl.","Kings Row"
"794",3386449,3389418,"You mean her having her things packedready to skedaddle.","Kings Row"
"795",3389486,3391078,"Tell you later.","Kings Row"
"796",3393323,3395450,"What were you about to say?","Kings Row"
"797",3395892,3398656,"When you say that Parris is not the onewe should talk to,","Kings Row"
"798",3398728,3401060,"you imply there's someone else.","Kings Row"
"799",3401698,3403393,"I guess I mean me.","Kings Row"
"800",3403600,3406899,"- Do you know something about this affair?- I knew Cassie Tower.","Kings Row"
"801",3406970,3409632,"I just heard you sayher things were packed.","Kings Row"
"802",3409706,3412072,"Well, we were going to run away.","Kings Row"
"803",3412142,3415339,"She'd been getting out to meet mefor a long time.","Kings Row"
"804",3415478,3419938,"- Do I have to say anything more?- Did Dr. Tower know anything about this?","Kings Row"
"805",3420016,3423315,"I guess I wouldn't be here today if he had.Pretty lucky.","Kings Row"
"806",3424320,3427187,"But I don't know anything about this crimeor whatever you call it.","Kings Row"
"807",3427257,3431284,"And if you want to put me on the standI'll even lie about what I just told you.","Kings Row"
"808",3431361,3434819,"- Is it all right if I go now?- I guess it is. Nothing to hold you on.","Kings Row"
"809",3434898,3437560,"Why did you come here to tell us this?","Kings Row"
"810",3437634,3440398,"I just wanted to relieve your mind, sir.","Kings Row"
"811",3441404,3444498,"You won't need to talk to Parris now,will you?","Kings Row"
"812",3445074,3447634,"Looks like you jumpedto the wrong conclusion, Drake.","Kings Row"
"813",3447710,3449337,"All I wanted to see Parris for","Kings Row"
"814",3449412,3452313,"was to tell him about this letterthat Dr. Tower wrote.","Kings Row"
"815",3452382,3455909,"He left his property,everything he owned to Parris.","Kings Row"
"816",3456419,3457477,"He what?","Kings Row"
"817",3457554,3459818,"Well, it appears you weren't so luckyas you thought you were.","Kings Row"
"818",3459889,3461413,"If he'd know abouthis prospective son-in-law","Kings Row"
"819",3461491,3463721,"he might have left it to you.","Kings Row"
"820",3465094,3467119,"I guess I'll go now, sir.","Kings Row"
"821",3471434,3475564,"Funny thing. I sort of like that boy.Bold as brass.","Kings Row"
"822",3476239,3479265,"But he is the only young man in townbeside Parris Mitchell","Kings Row"
"823",3479342,3482402,"who has grace enoughto say sir to his elders.","Kings Row"
"824",3486649,3489277,"- Now, for Pete's sake, please...- Why, Drake? Why did it happen?","Kings Row"
"825",3489352,3491820,"Why did Cassie come here last night?What was she afraid of?","Kings Row"
"826",3491888,3493480,"What happened since the other nightwhen I saw her?","Kings Row"
"827",3493556,3495319,"What reason could her father have hadfor killing her?","Kings Row"
"828",3495391,3496915,"What reason could he have hadfor killing himself?","Kings Row"
"829",3496993,3499052,"Why didn't Cassie explain thingslast night?","Kings Row"
"830",3499128,3501528,"Why did Dr. Tower leave me his property?","Kings Row"
"831",3501631,3504361,"Why should anyone wanna kill Cassie,who never did any harm to anyone?","Kings Row"
"832",3510240,3511537,"Why?","Kings Row"
"833",3595992,3598517,"Say, do you know it'sthe middle of the night?","Kings Row"
"834",3598995,3600360,"Sit down, Drake.","Kings Row"
"835",3601631,3603030,"Sure, what's up?","Kings Row"
"836",3604934,3606629,"I think I know...","Kings Row"
"837",3606869,3609235,"I do know why Dr. Towerkilled Cassie and himself.","Kings Row"
"838",3609305,3610704,"Sure enough?","Kings Row"
"839",3610773,3613139,"You've got to promise methis'll be a secret between us, Drake.","Kings Row"
"840",3613209,3614335,"Of course.","Kings Row"
"841",3614644,3617044,"Drake, do you rememberMrs. Tower very well?","Kings Row"
"842",3617113,3619513,"Cassie's mother?A little, when we were kids.","Kings Row"
"843",3619582,3622483,"How she used to stay inside all the timejust up in her window looking out?","Kings Row"
"844",3622552,3624110,"Sure. Everybody thought she was loco.","Kings Row"
"845",3624187,3626621,"How do you feelabout people like that, Drake?","Kings Row"
"846",3626689,3628520,"Do we have to talk about it now?","Kings Row"
"847",3628691,3631023,"How do you feelabout somebody who gets a bad heart,","Kings Row"
"848",3631094,3633392,"or something wrong with their legsor their hands or their eyes?","Kings Row"
"849",3633463,3636296,"Well, things like that,that aren't their fault...","Kings Row"
"850",3637233,3640066,"That's the way I feel about people whoget something wrong with their brains.","Kings Row"
"851",3640136,3642661,"Say, are you trying to tell me Dr. Tower...","Kings Row"
"852",3643006,3646772,"- You know, kid, I always did tell you...- There's a note here near the beginning","Kings Row"
"853",3646843,3650779,"that says, ""Today, I noticedthe first sign in Cassandra.""","Kings Row"
"854",3653950,3656714,"- Do you mean that she... That Cassie...- Not so you could notice it.","Kings Row"
"855",3656786,3658083,"No more, I suppose,when Mrs. Tower was","Kings Row"
"856",3658154,3660315,"when D. Tower fell in love with herand married her.","Kings Row"
"857",3660390,3662722,"- Our own Cassie?- They were just the first indications,","Kings Row"
"858",3662792,3665317,"the early maladjustmentsof dementia praecox.","Kings Row"
"859",3666095,3668359,"Hey, you sound like a doctor already.","Kings Row"
"860",3669165,3670928,"I certainly don't feel like one.","Kings Row"
"861",3671000,3673867,"- Well, we won't talk about it anymore...- No, I'd rather.","Kings Row"
"862",3674170,3678004,"- Drake, I think Dr. Tower knew about us.- About you and Cassie?","Kings Row"
"863",3679409,3682037,"But, do you think that she knew?About herself, I mean.","Kings Row"
"864",3682111,3683738,"Yes, I'm sure she did.","Kings Row"
"865",3683946,3685538,"That's why whenever I asked herquestions about us","Kings Row"
"866",3685615,3687014,"I could never pin her down.","Kings Row"
"867",3687083,3689074,"What about the nightshe came to ask you to take her away?","Kings Row"
"868",3689152,3690779,"She wasn't pinned down then.","Kings Row"
"869",3691921,3694082,"A kind of final desperation, I guess.","Kings Row"
"870",3695291,3698852,"I don't know what Dr. Tower knewabout that night. Maybe nothing.","Kings Row"
"871",3698961,3700292,"Maybe he guessed.","Kings Row"
"872",3702265,3704665,"Maybe he was just looking into my future.","Kings Row"
"873",3704834,3707496,"- I don't quite follow you, kid.- He was a brilliant doctor, Drake.","Kings Row"
"874",3707570,3709435,"Why did he cometo a little town here like Kings Row","Kings Row"
"875",3709505,3712201,"and bury himselfwhile he was still pretty young?","Kings Row"
"876",3712275,3713936,"You mean Mrs. Tower?","Kings Row"

"1356",5456484,5459317,"Well, I've heard there are homesthat you can get into.","Kings Row"
"1357",5459387,5460911,"Drake McHugh.","Kings Row"
"1358",5460988,5463183,"Don't do that, Randy, I'd be all right.","Kings Row"
"1359",5463257,5465452,"I'm going to see to it that you are.","Kings Row"
"1360",5465526,5468859,"Listen, Drake,I didn't ask to come into your life, did I?","Kings Row"
"1361",5468930,5470022,"No.","Kings Row"
"1362",5470097,5472258,"All right, but then you owe me something.","Kings Row"

"1364",5476137,5479072,"- Drake, are you all right?- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1365",5480074,5482702,"I guess I don't get it through my headjust what you want.","Kings Row"

"1371",5512340,5515776,"Then you can talk if you want to,but I want my say first.","Kings Row"
"1372",5515843,5518710,"It's first of all, what Parris said therein the cablegram.","Kings Row"

"1374",5521682,5524480,"We're going to do that,but I'd made up my mind about it","Kings Row"
"1375",5524552,5526486,"a long time before this happened.","Kings Row"
"1376",5526554,5530422,"Then after you got hurt,I just had to figure out how, that was all.","Kings Row"
"1377",5530491,5533324,"Remember once you said somethingabout marrying me?","Kings Row"
"1378",5533394,5536363,"Well, I got madbecause I guess I'd been a little hurt.","Kings Row"
"1379",5536464,5539126,"I knew you'd never thought about ituntil just then.","Kings Row"
"1380",5539200,5541395,"Then I shouldn't be blaming youeven that much.","Kings Row"
"1381",5541469,5544802,"You never thought about much of anythingin those days until you had to.","Kings Row"
"1382",5544872,5547204,"Then, later on you came down here.","Kings Row"
"1383",5547275,5550733,"Remember the morningyou came to ask Pa to help you get a job?","Kings Row"
"1384",5550811,5553075,"Well, I made up my mind that daythat I'd marry you,","Kings Row"
"1385",5553147,5555081,"as soon as the right time came around.","Kings Row"
"1386",5555149,5558778,"I guess I was convinced inside by thenthat you did wanna marry me.","Kings Row"
"1387",5558853,5560377,"I knew I wanted to marry you...","Kings Row"
"1388",5560454,5563821,"- Randy, for Pete's sake, I...- Hush, you were to listen.","Kings Row"
"1389",5563891,5565688,"So, now the right time has come.","Kings Row"
"1390",5565760,5567557,"We'll get married,and then we'll work out some way","Kings Row"
"1391",5567628,5568652,"what we'll do afterwards.","Kings Row"
"1392",5568729,5570697,"- Randy.- I won't listen.","Kings Row"
"1393",5571399,5575392,"I'm going to cable Parris now and tell him.He'll be glad, Drake.","Kings Row"
"1394",5584512,5587811,"Of course, Randy,it is a ghastly and terrible tragedy,","Kings Row"
"1395",5588316,5590750,"particularly to have happened to Drake.","Kings Row"
"1396",5590818,5593082,"He lived by his freedom and independence.","Kings Row"
"1397",5593154,5597147,"He will feel, probably already feels,that he's lost both.","Kings Row"
"1398",5597224,5600125,"It'll be your problemto restore them to him.","Kings Row"
"1399",5600194,5603595,"Repairs to the body can sometimesbe made in a short space of time.","Kings Row"
"1400",5603664,5605325,"The injury to the mind,","Kings Row"
"1401",5605399,5608630,"to what is called the psyche,this takes longer.","Kings Row"
"1402",5608703,5611399,"The psychic injuries strike at his pride,his initiative,","Kings Row"
"1403",5611472,5614441,"and we shall have to save themif we're to save Drake.","Kings Row"
"1404",5614508,5616772,"Never when I decidedto become a psychiatrist","Kings Row"
"1405",5616844,5619711,"did I imagine I'd be writingmy first prescription","Kings Row"
"1406",5619780,5621338,"for my dearest friend.","Kings Row"
"1407",5621415,5622643,"As soon as he's well enough,","Kings Row"
"1408",5622717,5624685,"he must find an interestoutside of himself.","Kings Row"
"1409",5624752,5626879,"Some job to do that will force himto depend upon himself","Kings Row"
"1410",5626954,5628444,"and make his own decisions.","Kings Row"
"1411",5628522,5631889,"The helpless invalid complexmust be avoided at all cost.","Kings Row"
"1412",5631959,5635486,"In fact, he must be made to feel thatsince he was making a living for himself","Kings Row"
"1413",5635563,5637622,"he will, of course, go on making a living.","Kings Row"
"1414",5637698,5639893,"I've written to the bankinstructing them to turn over to you","Kings Row"
"1415",5639967,5642162,"the small Tower estate that was left me.","Kings Row"
"1416",5642236,5644636,"Use it to make some sortof a new beginning for you.","Kings Row"
"1417",5644705,5647003,"I don't care if it's real estateor chicken farming,","Kings Row"
"1418",5647074,5649440,"so long as it is somethingthat will take his mind off himself","Kings Row"
"1419",5649510,5652707,"and make him realizethat he's still some use in this world.","Kings Row"
"1420",5652780,5654839,"I feel so helpless being way over here.","Kings Row"
"1421",5654915,5658646,"I rely on you.You must obey my instructions faithfully.","Kings Row"
"1422",5662590,5664217,"Dear friend, Parris,","Kings Row"
"1423",5664291,5667454,"I don't know what I'd dowithout your daily letters.","Kings Row"
"1424",5667528,5671055,"I think I'm just beginning to seewhat you're trying to accomplish.","Kings Row"
"1425",5671132,5673259,"I had a terrible time about the money.","Kings Row"
"1426",5673334,5677134,"I tried to remember what you said,to make him decide for himself.","Kings Row"
"1427",5677538,5680200,"But you know Drake, how proud he is.","Kings Row"
"1428",5680274,5683072,"If you could have seen himjutting out his chin and saying...","Kings Row"
"1429",5683144,5684668,"I won't take charity.","Kings Row"
"1430",5684812,5687576,"- Very well, dear.- Do you want me to take it?","Kings Row"
"1431",5687648,5690139,"You'll have to decide thatfor yourself, Drake.","Kings Row"
"1432",5690217,5692481,"Women haven't got any senseabout money.","Kings Row"
"1433",5692553,5694612,"Of course, I'd hate to see youhurt Parris' feelings.","Kings Row"
"1434",5694689,5695713,"What do you mean?","Kings Row"
"1435",5695790,5697758,"Oh, he's gone to all that trouble.","Kings Row"
"1436",5697825,5700123,"You'd do the same for him, mind you.","Kings Row"
"1437",5700194,5702924,"I guess you'd feel pretty bad, tooif he just took some of your money","Kings Row"
"1438",5702997,5705363,"without any intention of ever returning it.","Kings Row"
"1439",5705433,5708561,"But that's just the point.How could I ever pay him back?","Kings Row"
"1440",5709170,5712401,"- You think I can learn needlework, honey?- Don't joke like that.","Kings Row"
"1441",5712473,5714873,"Well, if there was anything at allI could do...","Kings Row"
"1442",5714942,5717433,"You still got your brains, Drake.","Kings Row"
"1443",5717511,5720776,"No, don't turn your face to the wall.Look at me.","Kings Row"
"1444",5720848,5724682,"You're my man and I love you.And you're a better man than a lot I know.","Kings Row"
"1445",5724752,5727550,"Take Peyton Graves, for instance,puffed up like a pouter pigeon","Kings Row"
"1446",5727621,5731421,"because he went aheadwith that real estate deal all by himself.","Kings Row"
"1447",5731492,5732857,"Say...","Kings Row"
"1448",5735996,5737725,"No, I guess, we couldn't.","Kings Row"
"1449",5738666,5740031,"Couldn't what?","Kings Row"
"1450",5740101,5743366,"That land down by the creekyou're so crazy about.","Kings Row"

"1452",5747208,5748539,"You've got brains.","Kings Row"
"1453",5748609,5751942,"Of course, you'd have to tell meeverything to do, I'm only a woman.","Kings Row"
"1454",5752012,5754776,"- Do you think we should try it?- You're the boss.","Kings Row"
"1455",5755316,5757784,"Oh, let's, Drake.We can do anything together.","Kings Row"
"1456",5757852,5759183,"We're just a young couple starting out.","Kings Row"
"1457",5759253,5760880,"Others have started on borrowed money.","Kings Row"
"1458",5760955,5762820,"Wouldn't old Parris be surprisedif he came home","Kings Row"
"1459",5762890,5764551,"and found us all set up in business?","Kings Row"

"1461",5766160,5767218,"Hey, go easy.","Kings Row"
"1462",5767294,5768761,"He wouldn't be ashamed of me then,would he?","Kings Row"
"1463",5768829,5770820,"- Parris?- He'd be proud of me, wouldn't he, Randy?","Kings Row"
"1464",5770898,5772661,"Sure, he'd be.","Kings Row"

"1486",5872867,5874459,"Mary, blessed Mother of God.","Kings Row"
"1487",5880107,5882507,"Well, how does the old town look?","Kings Row"
"1488",5882576,5884407,"Oh, I don't know, all right.","Kings Row"
"1489",5884612,5886705,"Of course, after Vienna and Paris,it's a little strange.","Kings Row"
"1490",5886780,5888008,"I'll bet.","Kings Row"
"1491",5888082,5890414,"Well, it's the same old provincial hole.","Kings Row"

"1496",5901395,5903659,"Did you notice anythingas you came along the hall?","Kings Row"
"1497",5903731,5906097,"Something new or anything like that?","Kings Row"
"1498",5906166,5908134,"- Don't believe I did.- Not a thing, eh?","Kings Row"
"1499",5908202,5910432,"Then I got a surprise for you.","Kings Row"
"1500",5911238,5913365,"Yes, sir, you wait and see.","Kings Row"
"1501",5921849,5925717,"Fixed it up to set you off on the right footand make you feel at home.","Kings Row"

"1509",5939300,5941165,"Not in Kings Row? Why not?","Kings Row"
"1510",5941235,5943931,"For one thing, I've been offered a positionin the school in Vienna,","Kings Row"
"1511",5944004,5945369,"an invaluable opportunity.","Kings Row"
"1512",5945439,5948636,"I secured a leave of absenceand came home here","Kings Row"
"1513",5948709,5949767,"because of Drake.","Kings Row"
"1514",5949843,5952038,"As soon as I'm sure he's all right,I expect I'll go back.","Kings Row"
"1515",5952112,5955104,"Oh, this is a terrible shock, Parris,I'd counted on...","Kings Row"
"1516",5955182,5958310,"Well, we need a new man here,now that Dr. Gordon's dead.","Kings Row"
"1517",5958385,5959579,"Dr. Gordon's dead?","Kings Row"
"1518",5959653,5962713,"Yeah, hadn't you heard?Passed on last month, like that.","Kings Row"
"1519",5962790,5963882,"Heart, I guess.","Kings Row"
"1520",5963958,5965585,"Newspapers must have passed meon the way home.","Kings Row"
"1521",5965659,5968184,"Yes, sir, him is deader than a doornail.","Kings Row"
"1522",5968262,5970355,"Is either one of you gentlemenDr. Mitchell?","Kings Row"
"1523",5970431,5974128,"'Cause you ain't, Colonel Skeffington,then this letter must be for you.","Kings Row"
"1524",5974201,5976396,"- Amazing deduction, Daisy.- Thank you, Daisy.","Kings Row"
"1525",5976470,5978836,"You's welcome. You's the doctor now.","Kings Row"
"1526",5979340,5982639,"Little Parris Mitchell,what do you think of that?","Kings Row"
"1527",5985346,5987974,"- Mrs. Henry Gordon.- Imagine that.","Kings Row"
"1528",5988615,5992415,"Haven't seen much of the Gordons lately.Louise, not at all.","Kings Row"
"1529",5993520,5995613,"She wasn't even at her father's funeral.","Kings Row"
"1530",5995689,5997156,"- She...- Well, I'll run along.","Kings Row"
"1531",5997224,6000250,"Come up to the house when you can.We'll have a chin.","Kings Row"
"1532",6000327,6001851,"Thanks, I will.","Kings Row"
"1533",6011305,6014638,"Dr. Mitchell, I'm sure you were surprisedto hear from me.","Kings Row"
"1534",6015642,6019043,"Somehow, I felt thatI could trust your discretion","Kings Row"
"1535",6019113,6021946,"since you used to be a friend of Louise's.","Kings Row"
"1536",6023817,6027719,"I've been through a very trying experiencesince my husband passed away.","Kings Row"
"1537",6027955,6030185,"Is Louise ill?","Kings Row"
"1538",6031992,6034790,"I'm afraid her mind has become affected.","Kings Row"
"1539",6036997,6039465,"After Drake McHughmet with his accident,","Kings Row"
"1540",6039533,6042468,"Louise had a terrible scene with her father.","Kings Row"
"1541",6043637,6045468,"A little while after,","Kings Row"
"1542",6046106,6049303,"we heard a strange reportthat he'd actually married...","Kings Row"
"1543",6049376,6052243,"A Miss Monaghan, who's takingmarvelous care of him, Mrs. Gordon.","Kings Row"
"1544",6052312,6054143,"- Really?- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1545",6054214,6056341,"That seems remarkable, doesn't it?","Kings Row"
"1546",6057451,6061012,"But from that day on,Louise refused to leave her room.","Kings Row"
"1547",6061255,6064691,"She wouldn't speak.She did nothing but sit in her room.","Kings Row"
"1548",6066560,6068687,"Then Dr. Gordon passed away.","Kings Row"
"1549",6070664,6074065,"And now I have to tell you a terrible thing.","Kings Row"
"1550",6075569,6076866,"When...","Kings Row"
"1551",6078172,6082370,"When my dear husbandwas lying here in this room,","Kings Row"
"1552",6087414,6089314,"Louise came downstairs.","Kings Row"
"1553",6089650,6092847,"I followed her after a few minutes,and I found her...","Kings Row"
"1554",6092920,6095946,"Yes, Mrs. Gordon?Just try to tell me quietly.","Kings Row"
"1555",6100060,6104997,"I found her standing over her dead fatherand cursing him.","Kings Row"
"1556",6107134,6109159,"Dr. Mitchell, I'm a desperate mother.","Kings Row"
"1557",6109236,6113639,"I cannot bear that my daughter shouldso defame the memory of a great man.","Kings Row"
"1558",6113707,6116005,"I know that you've been studying therein Vienna.","Kings Row"
"1559",6116076,6118169,"There's no doctor herewho understands these things.","Kings Row"
"1560",6118245,6120042,"No one at all I can turn to.","Kings Row"
"1561",6120114,6123413,"Can you help me with her?To keep her quiet.","Kings Row"
"1562",6125119,6127986,"- Where is she?- I'll take you to her.","Kings Row"
"1563",6139633,6143501,"I've brought an old friend to see you.Parris Mitchell, daughter.","Kings Row"
"1564",6143570,6146539,"Dr. Mitchell now,and he's come to see you.","Kings Row"
"1565",6146607,6148131,"Hello, Louise.","Kings Row"
"1566",6148408,6150239,"- Parris?- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1567",6151311,6152778,"Parris Mitchell.","Kings Row"
"1568",6152846,6156407,"I'm awfully glad to see you again.It's been a long time.","Kings Row"
"1569",6156717,6158878,"Yes, it's been a long time.","Kings Row"
"1570",6160988,6162216,"Go away.","Kings Row"
"1571",6171965,6174991,"- You're Dr. Mitchell now.- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1572",6180174,6182768,"- I'm not crazy, Parris.- Of course not.","Kings Row"
"1573",6182843,6184572,"She thinks I am.","Kings Row"
"1574",6185679,6189137,"- It's a wonder I'm not, but I'm not.- I know that, Louise.","Kings Row"
"1575",6190751,6192776,"- Have you seen Drake?- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1576",6193387,6194752,"How is he?","Kings Row"
"1577",6195422,6197652,"- As well as he can be.- She married him.","Kings Row"
"1578",6197724,6200022,"She was the kind he liked.He never went with any other kind.","Kings Row"
"1579",6200093,6203028,"She takes good care of him, Louise.He had to have care, you understand.","Kings Row"
"1580",6203096,6205656,"- My father cut his legs off, Parris.- Yes, I know.","Kings Row"
"1581",6205732,6207222,"I was there.","Kings Row"
"1582",6208202,6212036,"- You were where?- I was too late. If I hadn't been too late...","Kings Row"
"1583",6213440,6215340,"I'm not crazy, Parris.","Kings Row"
"1584",6215776,6217300,"I know, Louise.","Kings Row"
"1585",6217878,6219971,"You must find out about it.","Kings Row"
"1586",6220881,6223850,"There was a man who helped my father,maybe he'd know.","Kings Row"
"1587",6223917,6227114,"I don't believe it was necessary.My father did it on my account.","Kings Row"
"1588",6228589,6231080,"You see? You think I'm crazy, too.","Kings Row"
"1589",6231158,6233388,"Do you realize what you're saying?A horrible accusation.","Kings Row"
"1590",6233460,6235724,"You've got to believe me, I kept a list.","Kings Row"
"1591",6235796,6238890,"He always talked about his operations,other doctors don't do that.","Kings Row"
"1592",6238966,6241833,"He thought it was his duty to punishwickedness wherever he found it.","Kings Row"
"1593",6241902,6244427,"He was a fanatic like my mother,he used to talk to her.","Kings Row"
"1594",6244504,6246199,"- I think she knew, too.- But your own father!","Kings Row"
"1595",6246273,6247638,"My father.","Kings Row"
"1596",6248308,6251573,"Nearly always he'd say their heartswere too weak for chloroform.","Kings Row"
"1597",6251645,6254136,"But their hearts were not too weakto be cut to pieces.","Kings Row"
"1598",6254214,6257377,"And with Drake, he had a double purpose.He hated him because of me.","Kings Row"
"1599",6260053,6262886,"Parris, do you think I'm crazy?","Kings Row"
"1600",6264291,6266623,"No, Louise, I'm sure you're not.","Kings Row"
"1601",6267828,6269955,"I want you to begin quietly.","Kings Row"
"1602",6270330,6271922,"I want you to gather all the evidence...","Kings Row"
"1603",6271999,6274024,"But your father's dead,it's all over and done with.","Kings Row"
"1604",6274101,6275568,"I want to tell. I want them all to know.","Kings Row"
"1605",6275636,6277467,"- But, Louise...- I want to destroy his memory!","Kings Row"
"1606",6277537,6279402,"Have you thoughtwhat terrible harm you would do?","Kings Row"
"1607",6279473,6282533,"Perhaps someone you love.You used to love Drake.","Kings Row"
"1608",6282609,6283837,"To be crippled is terrible enough,","Kings Row"
"1609",6283910,6285138,"but to find out it was unnecessary...","Kings Row"
"1610",6285212,6287476,"- She married him!- You must try to be calm.","Kings Row"
"1611",6292452,6296718,"Parris, will you help me?","Kings Row"
"1612",6297591,6300219,"Yes, Louise, I'll help you all I can.","Kings Row"
"1613",6301595,6304689,"- What will we do first?- First?","Kings Row"
"1614",6306466,6310266,"We'll not say a word about this to anyone.For a little while.","Kings Row"
"1615",6310470,6313200,"We'll keep it a secret between us,you know, until we're sure.","Kings Row"
"1616",6313273,6316003,"I'll come and talk to you every day,whenever you want.","Kings Row"
"1617",6316276,6320178,"If you want me to help you, you mustput yourself entirely in my hands.","Kings Row"
"1618",6320247,6322579,"Will you do that for me, Louise?","Kings Row"
"1619",6324117,6325550,"Maybe I will.","Kings Row"
"1620",6326887,6329321,"- For a little while.- That's better.","Kings Row"
"1621",6329389,6332381,"Now, let's begin thinking aboutother things.","Kings Row"
"1622",6332526,6334357,"There's a book I've been readingyou might like.","Kings Row"
"1623",6336063,6338122,"Do you think there could bethe slightest possible ground","Kings Row"
"1624",6338198,6340928,"for Louise's charges against her father?","Kings Row"
"1625",6341034,6343059,"- Yes.- But a man, a doctor...","Kings Row"
"1626",6343136,6346105,"I don't say it's true. I say it's possible.","Kings Row"
"1627",6346673,6349870,"Sadistic surgeons are not unknownin medical history.","Kings Row"
"1628",6349943,6352844,"They're scarce, thank heaven.One in millions.","Kings Row"
"1629",6353280,6356977,"You're startled to think that such a thingcould happen right here in Kings Row.","Kings Row"
"1630",6357050,6358984,"You wouldn't be shockedif you heard of it happening","Kings Row"
"1631",6359052,6361350,"in some remote townin Europe somewhere.","Kings Row"
"1632",6361421,6363616,"I'm shocked because of Drake.","Kings Row"
"1633",6364057,6368391,"Son, men have often killed other menwho are after their daughters.","Kings Row"
"1634",6369863,6371057,"Murder.","Kings Row"
"1635",6371998,6375957,"Parris, I think you better get yourself freeof this Gordon case.","Kings Row"
"1636",6376036,6377901,"- I can't.- Why not?","Kings Row"
"1637",6377971,6381236,"- Well, Louise isn't insane.- Then she doesn't need your help.","Kings Row"
"1638",6381308,6382798,"If I don't help her, she'll become insane.","Kings Row"
"1639",6382876,6384867,"I've tried everything I know.Talk, books, music.","Kings Row"
"1640",6385245,6387509,"I tell you, she'll go insaneunless I relieve her obsession","Kings Row"
"1641",6387581,6388946,"by letting her tell everything she knows.","Kings Row"
"1642",6389015,6392382,"You think it'll do any good to have a thinglike that noised around?","Kings Row"
"1643",6394321,6397620,"- Then do you want some real advice, son?- Yes, sir.","Kings Row"
"1644",6397924,6401587,"Get out of this town. Now.Before you're in too deep.","Kings Row"
"1645",6401661,6403754,"- But I thought you said...- Changed my mind.","Kings Row"
"1646",6403864,6406492,"That golden chance in Vienna, take it.","Kings Row"
"1647",6407768,6410236,"I can't leave here with this thing unsolved.","Kings Row"
"1648",6410370,6413601,"Go on like that from case to case,you'll be here a lifetime.","Kings Row"
"1649",6413673,6416699,"Don't tell me you could be satisfiedto be here.","Kings Row"
"1650",6419746,6422408,"I never wanted to see Kings Row again.","Kings Row"
"1651",6423617,6425244,"But still it's...","Kings Row"
"1652",6425819,6428754,"I don't know,it's the place where I grew up.","Kings Row"
"1653",6429289,6432258,"I used to love to walk around the countryand just look at it.","Kings Row"
"1654",6432626,6434753,"Every leaf and stick of it.","Kings Row"
"1655",6435295,6437229,"If I could do that now.","Kings Row"
"1656",6437531,6438896,"Can't you?","Kings Row"
"1657",6441902,6446134,"Afraid of meeting ghosts, or memories.People I loved.","Kings Row"
"1658",6446940,6449773,"My grandmother. Dr. Tower.","Kings Row"
"1659",6451144,6452475,"Cassandra.","Kings Row"
"1660",6454681,6458708,"Places I remember. The stile and the pond,the house I lived in.","Kings Row"
"1661",6458785,6462414,"- Been out there since you got back?- Couldn't stand to see it.","Kings Row"
"1662",6462522,6466891,"I thought chasing away ghostsfrom people's minds was right in your line.","Kings Row"
"1663",6466993,6469723,"- What?- I gotta be running along now.","Kings Row"
"1664",6470363,6473059,"- Wait a minute. Colonel.- So long, sonny.","Kings Row"
"1665",6503396,6504556,"Cassie!","Kings Row"
"1666",6511638,6512866,"Hello.","Kings Row"
"1667",6515208,6516869,"Don't go away.","Kings Row"
"1668",6517611,6520842,"I don't mean to intrude.You see, I'm Parris Mitchell and I...","Kings Row"
"1669",6520914,6524179,"Are you Dr. Mitchell,the one that plays the piano?","Kings Row"
"1670",6524885,6526853,"Well, nobody ever identified methat way before.","Kings Row"
"1671",6526920,6531118,"- Professor Berdorff often speaks of you.- Do you take piano from him?","Kings Row"
"1672",6531391,6534326,"- Yes, a little.- But he tells me he has only dunderheads.","Kings Row"
"1673",6534394,6536692,"- I'm a dunderhead.- I don't believe it.","Kings Row"
"1674",6536763,6539698,"How could you know?He said you were a genius.","Kings Row"
"1675",6539766,6542929,"Well, I'm not. You have a trace of accent.Are you European?","Kings Row"
"1676",6543003,6545471,"- I'm Viennese.- I studied medicine in Vienna.","Kings Row"
"1677",6545539,6546870,"Yes, I know.","Kings Row"
"1678",6547607,6550838,"- You know everything, don't you?- Some people get talked about.","Kings Row"
"1679",6551545,6555743,"I'm Elise Sandor. My father's headof the experiment station here.","Kings Row"
"1680",6555982,6559440,"Of course, you've come to see your home.We've been expecting you.","Kings Row"
"1681",6561488,6566425,"I always used to walk in this way, overthe stile, down the trees, past the pond.","Kings Row"
"1682",6567360,6570227,"The pond was a very, very special place.","Kings Row"
"1683",6571364,6575300,"It is to me, too. Would you liketo walk down and see it closer?","Kings Row"
"1684",6576069,6577331,"If you don't mind.","Kings Row"
"1685",6577404,6579964,"Why ever should I? It was yours first.","Kings Row"
"1686",6581541,6584339,"- Have you lived here a long time?- Almost two years.","Kings Row"
"1687",6584411,6587141,"All that time?And I didn't know, Miss Sandor.","Kings Row"
"1688",6587213,6590580,"Everyone calls me Elise.I'm not used to ""Miss"" yet.","Kings Row"
"1689",6590917,6593647,"- How old are you? Do you mind?- Nineteen.","Kings Row"
"1690",6594087,6597022,"- Why, you're just a baby.- I don't think so.","Kings Row"
"1691",6597190,6598521,"Probably not.","Kings Row"
"1692",6598592,6601561,"Did you think you were just a babywhen you were 19?","Kings Row"
"1693",6601962,6602951,"No.","Kings Row"
"1694",6604264,6607791,"When you saw me, you called out a name.Why did you that?","Kings Row"
"1695",6608034,6610867,"I think I was startled with the wayyou looked sitting here.","Kings Row"
"1696",6610937,6612700,"Like someone named Cassie?","Kings Row"
"1697",6612973,6615840,"A little like someone, yes.A little girl I used to play with.","Kings Row"
"1698",6615909,6617740,"- Your sweetheart?- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1699",6618345,6620142,"We used to go swimming here.","Kings Row"
"1700",6620213,6623273,"We were just babies,but I think we knew we ought not to.","Kings Row"
"1701",6623350,6626217,"You mean... Oh, you naughty children.","Kings Row"
"1702",6626286,6629221,"- It was a long time ago.- What became of her?","Kings Row"
"1703",6629389,6630651,"She died.","Kings Row"
"1704",6633193,6636856,"- I'm sorry.- No, it's all right. I can think about it now.","Kings Row"
"1705",6638231,6641098,"Would you like to come upand see the house?","Kings Row"
"1706",6642235,6644294,"I'm a little timid about it.","Kings Row"
"1707",6644904,6646599,"Can you understand?","Kings Row"
"1708",6647107,6649769,"Come on. I'll go with you.","Kings Row"
"1709",6657017,6658644,"Does it look the same?","Kings Row"
"1710",6659085,6661519,"Almost as it used to when I'd come infrom school.","Kings Row"
"1711",6662122,6664522,"A little smaller, but I expected that.","Kings Row"
"1712",6666926,6668120,"Father.","Kings Row"
"1713",6670497,6672488,"Here's a visitor come to see us.","Kings Row"
"1714",6674901,6676095,"It's Dr. Mitchell.","Kings Row"
"1715",6676436,6677596,"What do you think?","Kings Row"
"1716",6677671,6678660,"How do you do, sir.","Kings Row"
"1717",6678738,6681229,"I'm very happy to welcome you,Dr. Mitchell.","Kings Row"
"1718",6681307,6683400,"Oh, but perhaps that's impertinent.","Kings Row"
"1719",6683476,6685444,"This used to be your room.","Kings Row"
"1720",6686112,6688307,"- We are the intruders.- Not at all, sir.","Kings Row"
"1721",6688381,6691748,"It looks... Well, we had the piano over hereinstead of where it is,","Kings Row"
"1722",6691818,6694446,"but otherwise, it's like coming home.","Kings Row"
"1723",6694587,6696851,"You'll stay to dinner, then?He may, mayn't he, Father?","Kings Row"
"1724",6696923,6700051,"- Certainly.- I'll bet you have a maid named Anna.","Kings Row"
"1725",6729389,6731380,"You're not a dunderhead.","Kings Row"
"1726",6731491,6733015,"- Surely?- Surely.","Kings Row"
"1727",6733193,6736060,"Some things you don't do in the right way.May I show you?","Kings Row"
"1728",6736129,6740088,"Would you? But this is a visit.The next time you come.","Kings Row"
"1729",6740166,6741633,"No, no. Let's get at it now.","Kings Row"
"1730",6741701,6743965,"I'm not a teacher,but I can show you some things, I think.","Kings Row"
"1731",6744037,6746369,"- Will you practice?- Six hours a day, if you say.","Kings Row"
"1732",6746439,6748373,"Heavens, no. Here, now.","Kings Row"
"1733",6748775,6750208,"The beginning.","Kings Row"
"1734",6750410,6752105,"Your tone is thin.","Kings Row"
"1735",6775869,6777063,"You see?","Kings Row"
"1736",6779439,6781407,"I had no idea. It's 11:00.","Kings Row"
"1737",6781474,6782600,"- Father, for shame.- Please forgive me.","Kings Row"
"1738",6782675,6784336,"What?","Kings Row"
"1739",6784677,6786076,"Going so early, Dr. Mitchell?","Kings Row"
"1740",6786146,6788774,"I'm going, but not so early, I'm afraid.Good night, sir.","Kings Row"
"1741",6788848,6791840,"You must come often,if my child isn't tiresome.","Kings Row"
"1742",6791918,6794887,"- Her? Oh...- She is a little lonely sometimes.","Kings Row"
"1743",6794954,6798048,"Talks too much,when she finds someone to listen.","Kings Row"
"1744",6798925,6802053,"You must feel that this is a littleyour home again, if you will?","Kings Row"
"1745",6802128,6805029,"She means that, Doctor.So do I, for that matter.","Kings Row"
"1746",6805098,6807999,"There's always room here.You know the house.","Kings Row"
"1747",6808067,6810695,"I want you feel that you can comesometimes to rest,","Kings Row"
"1748",6810804,6813830,"to stay over Sunday, whenever you will.","Kings Row"
"1749",6814407,6816432,"- Thank you, sir.- Which was you room?","Kings Row"
"1750",6816509,6818500,"The northwest corner room.","Kings Row"
"1751",6818578,6822708,"It's my room now. I love it.I have my bed under the big window.","Kings Row"
"1752",6822782,6824044,"So did I.","Kings Row"
"1753",6824417,6826044,"I'm glad it's your room.","Kings Row"
"1754",6826186,6829087,"And I'm glad that you,both of you live here.","Kings Row"
"1755",6829289,6832747,"Good night now.It's been a wonderful day and evening.","Kings Row"
"1756",6835228,6837560,"- You'll come often?- Yes.","Kings Row"
"1757",6838198,6840632,"You may be sure. Good night.","Kings Row"
"1758",6848608,6850508,"See all those marked in red?","Kings Row"
"1759",6850577,6852374,"They're all sold.The whole number one tract.","Kings Row"
"1760",6852445,6854538,"- Twenty-four lots.- That's great.","Kings Row"
"1761",6854614,6856047,"The clay pit workers took most of them.","Kings Row"
"1762",6856115,6858413,"Low prices, but they make wagesand pay off.","Kings Row"
"1763",6858484,6860918,"- Treasurer, show him the figures.- I just finished.","Kings Row"
"1764",6860987,6862784,"That's how we stand, as of today.","Kings Row"
"1765",6862856,6864414,"Half of that's yours of course.","Kings Row"
"1766",6864490,6866720,"We're all gonna be nasty, old, rich people,I can see that.","Kings Row"
"1767",6866793,6870194,"Not bad for a girland an old cripple piled up in bed.","Kings Row"
"1768",6870663,6873564,"It's marvelous, you kids. I'm tickled pink.","Kings Row"
"1769",6873766,6876132,"You know what you ought to dowhen you open up the new tract?","Kings Row"
"1770",6876202,6878693,"You ought to save a couple of lotsfor yourselves, move into a new house.","Kings Row"
"1771",6878771,6880068,"You'd like that, wouldn't you, Randy?","Kings Row"
"1772",6880139,6884599,"Like it? Why, that's what I've hoped formore than anything. May we, Drake?","Kings Row"
"1773",6885044,6887376,"- Randy...- Yes, honey, what is it?","Kings Row"
"1774",6887447,6889472,"Randy, listen.I want you to promise me one thing.","Kings Row"
"1775",6889549,6891073,"I'll promise you anything.","Kings Row"
"1776",6891150,6893846,"Promise me I'll never have to go outsideof this house until I'm dead.","Kings Row"
"1777",6893920,6895979,"- Oh, Drake, how foolish.- Promise me.","Kings Row"
"1778",6896055,6898580,"Of course I'll promise youif you want me to, darling.","Kings Row"
"1779",6898658,6900956,"Forget it, Drake. It was just an idea.","Kings Row"
"1780",6901594,6904563,"- I'm sorry.- You're fixed up here fine. Forget it.","Kings Row"
"1781",6904631,6906428,"Well, I've got to go.I've got a patient waiting.","Kings Row"
"1782",6906499,6908023,"Did you hear that, Drake?He's got a patient.","Kings Row"
"1783",6908134,6911126,"Oh, I got a lot of patients.Two colds and a pair of twins, last week.","Kings Row"
"1784",6911571,6912629,"I told you he'd be famous.","Kings Row"
"1785",6912705,6915071,"I'll come down to the door with you.Will you be all right, Drake?","Kings Row"
"1786",6915141,6917871,"- Sure, what do you think?- See you soon, plutocrat.","Kings Row"
"1787",6917944,6919206,"So long, Doc.","Kings Row"
"1788",6921915,6924042,"Do you suppose you'd hate to give mea cup of coffee?","Kings Row"
"1789",6924384,6925476,"I wanna talk to you for a minute.","Kings Row"
"1790",6925585,6927450,"- Is Drake...- He's all right.","Kings Row"
"1791",6927520,6929886,"We've got to expect those outburstsonce in a while.","Kings Row"
"1792",6929956,6931480,"Hello, Pa, Todd.","Kings Row"
"1793",6931557,6933115,"- Hello, Doc.- Caught us at it.","Kings Row"
"1794",6933192,6936457,"- Parris wants to talk to me, Pa.- Oh, yes.","Kings Row"
"1795",6936763,6938856,"Well, we'll step in the parlor.","Kings Row"
"1796",6938932,6940661,"- Sorry to chase you out.- Oh, that's all right.","Kings Row"
"1797",6940733,6943065,"- Oh, don't bother to make fresh.- It's no trouble.","Kings Row"
"1798",6943870,6947397,"It isn't good,that impulse of his to hide in a corner.","Kings Row"
"1799",6947941,6951104,"I've tried to get him to move,even as far as downstairs.","Kings Row"
"1800",6951244,6954975,"I know it's bad for him up there.He can see the trains and hear them.","Kings Row"
"1801",6955048,6956242,"Sometimes he has nightmares.","Kings Row"
"1802",6956316,6959046,"I've heard him wake upin the middle of the night, screaming.","Kings Row"
"1803",6961354,6964755,"He won't be the old Drake until he cango about as free as any of us.","Kings Row"
"1804",6964824,6967088,"Tod gave him a wheelchair oncefor a present.","Kings Row"
"1805",6967160,6969754,"He would have killed him if he could,and he loves Tod.","Kings Row"
"1806",6969829,6971387,"We'll think of a way.","Kings Row"
"1807",6971464,6974365,"I still believe we've half-wona very ticklish fight.","Kings Row"
"1808",6974767,6977292,"Of course, your marrying himdid more than anything.","Kings Row"
"1809",6977537,6980301,"I never told you,but I think it was fine of you.","Kings Row"
"1810",6981708,6985269,"- I didn't marry Drake out of pity, Parris.- I knew that.","Kings Row"
"1811",6985845,6987779,"I never loved anyone else.","Kings Row"
"1812",6987847,6990577,"Even in schoolI never had crushes on boys.","Kings Row"
"1813",6990650,6994814,"I liked them or I didn't. They saidnaughty things to me and that was all.","Kings Row"
"1814",6994887,6997583,"Aside from that,they treated me as one of themselves.","Kings Row"
"1815",6997724,7000215,"Then that day I saw Drake at the station,","Kings Row"
"1816",7000293,7002727,"well, he simply went to a placein my heart","Kings Row"
"1817",7002795,7004660,"that had been waiting for him.","Kings Row"
"1818",7004731,7006722,"Drake. Oh, Parris!","Kings Row"
"1819",7007133,7010466,"Tall and laughing and going aboutwith his head up.","Kings Row"
"1820",7019012,7023676,"Then after his accident, I knew I had toask myself a question and answer it.","Kings Row"
"1821",7024050,7026917,"I'd loved Drake wholly.What about that now?","Kings Row"
"1822",7027086,7028781,"What was left of it?","Kings Row"
"1823",7028988,7032583,"I was half afraid I might love him less.That something I couldn't help,","Kings Row"
"1824",7032658,7035684,"something physical,might turn me away from him.","Kings Row"
"1825",7035762,7037889,"There was my question staring at me.","Kings Row"
"1826",7038498,7041433,"Then, in one of your letters,there was a sentence,","Kings Row"
"1827",7041501,7044959,"""You must remember now,that Drake lives in a new world","Kings Row"
"1828",7045238,7049766,"""and that his relationship with itand with everyone in it will be changed.""","Kings Row"
"1829",7049842,7052709,"I knew that applied to Drakeand myself, too.","Kings Row"
"1830",7053279,7055941,"An episode of youth and fun had closed,","Kings Row"
"1831",7056215,7058979,"and with it had goneall the demands, forever.","Kings Row"
"1832",7059052,7061646,"I knew then that I didn't love him any less,","Kings Row"
"1833",7061721,7063245,"only differently.","Kings Row"
"1834",7063322,7066314,"With an overwhelming,new, calm feeling, Parris,","Kings Row"
"1835",7066392,7070624,"that so completely took the place of theold excitement that it would last forever.","Kings Row"
"1836",7073699,7075997,"Randy, you are wonderfully wise.","Kings Row"
"1837",7077103,7078900,"The coffee's boiling.","Kings Row"
"1838",7079238,7080796,"You can't see him. Nobody can see him.","Kings Row"
"1839",7080873,7083307,"- I will! I will see him!- What's that?","Kings Row"
"1840",7083443,7084808,"Louise! You shouldn't have come here.","Kings Row"
"1841",7084877,7087345,"You said you'd help me, but you won't.You're only tricking me.","Kings Row"
"1842",7087413,7090644,"- I'm going to tell Drake. He'll help me.- What is it?","Kings Row"
"1843",7090716,7091842,"She's the one he married.","Kings Row"
"1844",7091918,7093783,"Listen to me, Louise.Get control of yourself.","Kings Row"
"1845",7093853,7096344,"- You mustn't see Drake. Drake is ill.- You said you'd help me.","Kings Row"
"1846",7096422,7099858,"I said I would and I will, but I can't if youdon't do what I tell you. Go home now.","Kings Row"
"1847",7099926,7101188,"- Pa, you'll take her, won't you?- Sure.","Kings Row"
"1848",7101260,7102318,"- Will you help me?- Yes, Louise,","Kings Row"
"1849",7102395,7103953,"but you must let me do it my own way.","Kings Row"
"1850",7104030,7106294,"Go home with Mr. Monaghan now,and I'll come to talk to you tonight.","Kings Row"
"1851",7106365,7108833,"- You'll do that for me, won't you?- Yes, Parris.","Kings Row"
"1852",7112738,7115468,"Parris, that poor girl. What did she want?","Kings Row"
"1853",7115641,7117700,"I've been treating her.Her mother sent for me.","Kings Row"
"1854",7117777,7118766,"Drake was in love with her once?","Kings Row"
"1855",7118878,7121039,"That was over even beforeI went to Europe, Randy.","Kings Row"
"1856",7122215,7124581,"I suppose you might as well know.","Kings Row"
"1857",7124750,7127048,"Louise has had a sort of breakdown.","Kings Row"
"1858",7127487,7130183,"She has it in her headthat her father sometimes...","Kings Row"
"1859",7130690,7134023,"Well, her father sometimes performedunnecessary operations.","Kings Row"
"1860",7134093,7135117,"- Drake.- You mustn't think, Randy.","Kings Row"
"1861",7135194,7137219,"- You mustn't let yourself think...- Parris, did Dr. Gordon...","Kings Row"
"1862",7137296,7138456,"- I don't know.- You do and you won't tell me.","Kings Row"
"1863",7138531,7140556,"- I don't know.- I could tell you something about that.","Kings Row"
"1864",7140867,7144394,"Something I ain't never told before.Maybe I shouldn't now.","Kings Row"
"1865",7144570,7146697,"I think we'd better knowas much as possible now.","Kings Row"
"1866",7146772,7149332,"- I was there that night.- Yes, I know.","Kings Row"
"1867",7149509,7152637,"Something that Sam Winters said.He helped the doctor.","Kings Row"
"1868",7152712,7155909,"Something he said started me thinking.He said...","Kings Row"
"1869",7156549,7157914,"Go on, Tod.","Kings Row"
"1870",7158718,7161050,"- Drake wasn't run over, Parris.- What are you saying?","Kings Row"
"1871",7162121,7163645,"No, he wasn't.","Kings Row"
"1872",7163756,7166987,"When he was knocked over by them tiles,he was caught between two cars.","Kings Row"
"1873",7167059,7170495,"As near as I know, he was sort of,I guess you'd say pinched by a wheel","Kings Row"
"1874",7170563,7171791,"that didn't go clear over him.","Kings Row"
"1875",7171864,7173764,"Exactly what did Sam Winters say, Tod?","Kings Row"
"1876",7173866,7177063,"He said... I can rememberjust the right words.","Kings Row"
"1877",7177537,7180938,"He said, ""I looked good at them legs,and the bones in neither one of them","Kings Row"
"1878",7181007,7182133,"""was broke up one bit.""","Kings Row"
"1879",7182208,7183698,"Then it's true.","Kings Row"
"1880",7183976,7187537,"Stop it, Randy. Stop it.Even so, we can't ever know.","Kings Row"
"1881",7187613,7190138,"Sam Winters, an unprofessional witness.","Kings Row"
"1882",7190216,7191706,"What he says doesn't mean a thing.","Kings Row"
"1883",7191784,7193979,"I know how you feel, Randy,but we've still got Drake.","Kings Row"
"1884",7194053,7197386,"Drake's still alive.That's the only important thing.","Kings Row"
"1885",7197857,7200724,"- When Drake finds out...- He'll never find out.","Kings Row"
"1886",7200793,7203318,"Oh, but he will.She'll come again or someone else will.","Kings Row"
"1887",7203396,7206331,"That kind of news always gets home.Then what?","Kings Row"
"1888",7208501,7210935,"If it should ever enter Drake's mindthat this whole catastrophe","Kings Row"
"1889",7211003,7212231,"was anything but an accident...","Kings Row"
"1890",7212305,7213932,"What would happen?","Kings Row"
"1891",7214207,7217665,"I think the whole structure we built upfor him would topple down again.","Kings Row"
"1892",7217777,7220803,"This time we couldn't rebuild it.He'd be gone.","Kings Row"
"1893",7220880,7223178,"Louise has got to be kept quiet, Parris.","Kings Row"
"1894",7223649,7225674,"I can silence her, Randy.","Kings Row"
"1895",7226485,7229818,"She could be put in an asylum.Her mother wants that.","Kings Row"
"1896",7231224,7232282,"I can...","Kings Row"
"1897",7246339,7248637,"Whenever I had anything thatwas too big for me,","Kings Row"
"1898",7248708,7251370,"I used to run home with it, here,to my grandmother.","Kings Row"
"1899",7251477,7253775,"And what would she say, Parris?","Kings Row"
"1900",7253879,7256814,"She'd say, no one could tell mewhat is right and what is wrong,","Kings Row"
"1901",7256882,7258008,"except myself.","Kings Row"
"1902",7258951,7261351,"She must have been a very wise old lady.","Kings Row"
"1903",7261420,7264981,"But there isn't a right without a wrong,a terrible wrong.","Kings Row"
"1904",7265291,7267919,"Shall I commit Louise Gordonto a life of unspeakable horror?","Kings Row"
"1905",7267994,7270622,"Or let her mother carry out her plan,which is the same as my doing it?","Kings Row"
"1906",7270696,7271993,"You can't.","Kings Row"
"1907",7272064,7274157,"Then shall I set her freeand destroy Drake?","Kings Row"
"1908",7274233,7277134,"It isn't fair that you should have to decidesuch a thing.","Kings Row"
"1909",7277903,7279700,"I know what I can do.","Kings Row"
"1910",7279872,7282397,"I can get on a train, then get on a boat.","Kings Row"
"1911",7283376,7285207,"Will you go back with me to Vienna, Elise?","Kings Row"
"1912",7285278,7286939,"- Parris.- I mean it.","Kings Row"
"1913",7290082,7292676,"Yes, Parris. I'd go with you anywhere.","Kings Row"
"1914",7294987,7297421,"But you wouldn't be proud to go with me.","Kings Row"
"1915",7297490,7299355,"That's true, isn't it?","Kings Row"
"1916",7300393,7302657,"Parris, I've been so hoping.","Kings Row"
"1917",7303229,7304787,"Oh, for many things.","Kings Row"
"1918",7304864,7306764,"Ever since the first time I saw you,","Kings Row"
"1919",7306866,7308731,"and all the other times, too.","Kings Row"
"1920",7308801,7313363,"I've hoped that some day you would saysomething to me as you've just said.","Kings Row"
"1921",7313739,7315707,"And other things I've hoped, too.","Kings Row"
"1922",7315775,7319336,"I've hoped that you would never want togo back to Vienna, but stay here.","Kings Row"
"1923",7319445,7321606,"And find your work here, too.","Kings Row"
"1924",7322214,7324182,"I can't stay here. I've failed here.","Kings Row"
"1925",7326018,7328452,"Would you succeed then, in Vienna?","Kings Row"
"1926",7331590,7333387,"Perhaps you're right.","Kings Row"
"1927",7333659,7336492,"Perhaps I should never have triedto be a doctor.","Kings Row"
"1928",7336562,7339156,"But that's childish, unworthy of you.","Kings Row"
"1929",7339231,7341495,"If I could see any way at all.","Kings Row"
"1930",7342935,7344095,"Parris,","Kings Row"
"1931",7344370,7348033,"are you sure that your treatment for Drakeis the right one?","Kings Row"
"1932",7348674,7350437,"If I can't cure him, my best friend...","Kings Row"
"1933",7350509,7353205,"That's just it. He is your best friend.","Kings Row"
"1934",7353479,7355879,"Perhaps you protect him too much.","Kings Row"
"1935",7356415,7358042,"It would only be natural.","Kings Row"
"1936",7358150,7359617,"Suppose he was just a patient.","Kings Row"
"1937",7359685,7362449,"Suppose they both were,he and Louise Gordon.","Kings Row"
"1938",7362521,7364853,"Would you know what to do then?","Kings Row"
"1939",7365091,7367821,"Suppose they weren't people you lovedor even knew.","Kings Row"
"1940",7367893,7368882,"Don't say anything more.","Kings Row"
"1941",7373532,7376330,"Elise, wait here for me, right here,a little while.","Kings Row"
"1942",7376402,7377494,"Of course I will, but why?","Kings Row"
"1943",7377570,7379629,"What you said just now,I'm gonna try something.","Kings Row"
"1944",7380072,7383530,"If I don't come back,you'll know I haven't succeeded.","Kings Row"

"1951",7400393,7403362,"- Yeah? Who's gonna do it?- I am.","Kings Row"
"1952",7404196,7405595,"Start swinging.","Kings Row"
"1953",7405664,7407757,"It's something about youand Louise Gordon and her father.","Kings Row"
"1954",7407833,7409130,"- Parris.- She was here today, Louise was.","Kings Row"

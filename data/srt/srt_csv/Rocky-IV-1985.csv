"191",628870,632000,"That's nice. Thanks a lot.","Rocky IV"

"204",663010,667430,"My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarters today.","Rocky IV"
"205",667440,669670,"As you can see, it is highly advanced","Rocky IV"
"206",669680,673110,"and we wish to show the American press a small portion","Rocky IV"
"207",673120,675540,"of the advances our country's made","Rocky IV"
"208",675550,677880,"in the technology of human performance.","Rocky IV"
"209",677890,681210,"Coach Rimsky, what does all this do to enhance performance?","Rocky IV"
"210",681220,684020,"Well...If I may answer.","Rocky IV"
"211",684030,687320,"It makes a man a better man","Rocky IV"
"212",687330,692130,"a great athlete a super athlete by harnessing all his strength.","Rocky IV"
"213",692140,696400,"Though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry,","Rocky IV"
"214",696410,698870,"we wish to educate your country.","Rocky IV"
"215",698880,700960,"There have been rumors of doping","Rocky IV"
"216",700970,704440,"and distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.","Rocky IV"
"217",704440,706740,"Has Drago partaken in any such experiments?","Rocky IV"
"218",706750,709410,"No, Ivan in naturally trained.","Rocky IV"
"219",709420,712650,"Then how do you explain his freakish strength?","Rocky IV"
"220",712660,717660,"Like your Popeye, he ate his spinach every day.","Rocky IV"
"221",719100,720990,"Shall we have a demonstration?","Rocky IV"
"222",721000,722820,"Please do.Thank you.","Rocky IV"
"223",722830,727230,"A normal heavyweight","Rocky IV"
"224",727240,730070,"averages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch.","Rocky IV"
"225",739880,744540,"Drago averages 1850 pounds.","Rocky IV"
"226",744550,746410,"So the result is quite obvious.","Rocky IV"
"227",746420,748280,"What results are those?","Rocky IV"
"228",748290,752190,"Whatever he hits, he destroys.","Rocky IV"
"229",754600,757630,"He's big and he's strong, but he's clumsy.","Rocky IV"
"230",757630,759930,"I know I can beat him.","Rocky IV"
"231",759940,762030,"Why do you want to fight again?","Rocky IV"
"232",762040,765300,"It's something I believe in.","Rocky IV"
"233",765310,766670,"You can do your homework.","Rocky IV"

"238",776820,780080,"Yeah, and he will when it's for real.","Rocky IV"
"239",780090,782550,"This is just an exhibition bout. It's kid stuff.","Rocky IV"
"240",782560,783890,"What's the purpose?","Rocky IV"
"241",783900,785220,"What's worth getting hurt for?","Rocky IV"
"242",791630,792960,"What the hell is that?","Rocky IV"
"243",792970,795500,"That's my girl.","Rocky IV"
"244",801180,803740,"Thanks, honey.You're welcome.","Rocky IV"

"250",814790,816910,"She loves me.","Rocky IV"
"251",822670,824720,"Like I was saying,","Rocky IV"
"252",824730,827990,"I don't want this chump to come here with all that hype","Rocky IV"
"253",828000,829680,"trying to make us look bad.","Rocky IV"
"254",829690,831300,"They try every other way.","Rocky IV"
"255",831310,833530,"With Rock's help, we can get great media coverage,","Rocky IV"
"256",833540,835900,"We can make them look bad","Rocky IV"
"257",835910,837040,"I think it's wrong.","Rocky IV"
"258",837050,839470,"It's never been more right.","Rocky IV"
"259",839480,840890,"You're a great fighter,","Rocky IV"
"260",840900,842440,"but you've been retired for five years.","Rocky IV"
"261",842450,845340,"Don't you think it's time to think about something else?","Rocky IV"
"262",845350,847750,"How much can you take?","Rocky IV"
"263",847760,850260,"Either of you.","Rocky IV"

"270",874480,876810,"Paulie.","Rocky IV"
"271",880960,882720,"This was a great fight.","Rocky IV"
"272",882730,886250,"Great? I'm getting punchy just watching.","Rocky IV"
"273",886260,889760,"What you using for a chin there, Stallion?","Rocky IV"
"274",890870,892400,"I should have slipped that one.","Rocky IV"
"275",892410,895760,"Yeah, You definitely should have slipped.","Rocky IV"
"276",895770,900870,"It's crazy how people care about you when you're in that ring bleeding,","Rocky IV"
"277",900880,904170,"but once you step out of that ring, you're ancient history.","Rocky IV"
"278",904180,905940,"You ain't ancient history.","Rocky IV"
"279",905950,909480,"Nobody's asking for autographs.","Rocky IV"
"280",909650,914750,"Apollo, Can I ask you something?","Rocky IV"
"281",914760,915950,"What?","Rocky IV"
"282",915960,918950,"You know this fight you're having against the Russian.","Rocky IV"
"283",918960,923260,"Do you think maybe it ain't against him?","Rocky IV"
"284",923770,927690,"If it's not him, then who is it against?","Rocky IV"
"285",927700,932870,"Do you think maybe it's like you against you?","Rocky IV"
"286",932880,935030,"No, I think you really are getting brain damaged.","Rocky IV"
"287",935040,936420,"That's what I think.","Rocky IV"
"288",936430,937740,"Yeah, maybe, but","Rocky IV"
"289",937750,940370,"I'm speaking the truth, Apollo.","Rocky IV"
"290",940380,943350,"Are you? Yeah.","Rocky IV"
"291",943520,945610,"I don't think I want to hear this.","Rocky IV"
"292",945620,947250,"Come on, Apollo.","Rocky IV"
"293",947260,949420,"you're a great fighter. No doubt about that.","Rocky IV"
"294",949430,952320,"But we have to face the facts too.","Rocky IV"
"295",952330,955050,"You don't want to believe it, but maybe the show is over.","Rocky IV"
"296",955060,958290,"That's easy for you to say. You're still on top.","Rocky IV"
"297",958300,961390,"What happens when you're not on top? Then what?","Rocky IV"
"298",961400,965230,"Where do we go? We sure can't be born again.","Rocky IV"
"299",965240,970400,"I know we can't be born again, but we have to change sometime.","Rocky IV"
"300",970410,973070,"I don't want to change! I like who I am!","Rocky IV"
"301",973080,975810,"I like who you are too, but look at that.","Rocky IV"
"302",975820,978880,"You don't want to believe this, but that ain't us no more.","Rocky IV"
"303",978890,982420,"We can't do that the way we did before.","Rocky IV"
"304",982430,985850,"We're changing. We're turning into regular people.","Rocky IV"
"305",985860,988790,"No, maybe you think you're changing.","Rocky IV"
"306",988800,991160,"but you can't change what you really are.","Rocky IV"
"307",991170,996700,"Forget all this money and stuff around you. It don't change a thing.","Rocky IV"
"308",996770,1000830,"You and me don't even have a choice.","Rocky IV"
"309",1000840,1002900,"We're born with a killer instinct,","Rocky IV"
"310",1002910,1006640,"you can't turn off and on like a radio.","Rocky IV"
"311",1006650,1010280,"We have to be in the middle of the action because we're warriors.","Rocky IV"
"312",1010290,1013450,"Without some challenge, without some war to fight","Rocky IV"
"313",1013460,1017820,"then the warrior may as well be dead.","Rocky IV"
"314",1019900,1022960,"So I'm asking you,","Rocky IV"
"315",1023070,1026100,"as a friend,","Rocky IV"
"316",1028800,1032570,"stand by my side this one last time.","Rocky IV"
"317",1034840,1038410,"You're a great talker, Apollo.","Rocky IV"
"318",1040220,1044290,"All right, but when this is over.","Rocky IV"
"319",1046290,1048850,"You know me, Stallion.","Rocky IV"
"320",1048860,1051450,"I always think of something else.","Rocky IV"
"321",1051460,1053660,"That's what I'm afraid of.","Rocky IV"
"322",1053660,1055790,"All right, you have a deal.","Rocky IV"
"323",1055800,1059090,"I feel sorry for that guy.","Rocky IV"
"324",1059100,1063060,"Apollo, what made you decide to put on an exhibition with Drago?","Rocky IV"
"325",1063070,1065870,"Call it a sense of responsibility.","Rocky IV"
"326",1065880,1067830,"Responsibility, how?","Rocky IV"
"327",1067840,1071770,"I have to teach this young fellow how to box American style.","Rocky IV"
"328",1071780,1075170,"Isn't Drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring?","Rocky IV"
"329",1075180,1079710,"Some folks have to learn the hard way.","Rocky IV"
"330",1079720,1081710,"No knockout prediction?","Rocky IV"
"331",1081720,1083220,"I'm not angry with him.","Rocky IV"
"332",1083230,1085950,"I just want to show the world","Rocky IV"
"333",1085960,1088450,"Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.","Rocky IV"
"334",1088460,1092060,"How do you think Apollo should fight Drago?","Rocky IV"
"335",1092070,1097530,"Personally, the first thing you need is a ladder.","Rocky IV"
"336",1097540,1102670,"How does it feel to spar with the great former champion?","Rocky IV"
"337",1104350,1107440,"The man's tongue didn't come through customs.","Rocky IV"
"338",1109690,1112440,"My husband is very happy to have this opportunity.","Rocky IV"
"339",1112450,1113880,"It's his dream.","Rocky IV"
"340",1113890,1115480,"Dream. How do you mean?","Rocky IV"
"341",1115490,1119550,"In our country, Apollo Creed is well-known and very respected.","Rocky IV"
"342",1119560,1121990,"It could be a good victory.","Rocky IV"
"343",1122000,1126230,"Wait a minute. Win?","Rocky IV"
"344",1126270,1129330,"You don't really think you're going to whip me, do you?","Rocky IV"
"345",1129340,1130930,"He didn't come here to lose.","Rocky IV"
"346",1130940,1133000,"You hold on, little lady.","Rocky IV"

"349",1136950,1139370,"I've been with best, I've beaten the best.","Rocky IV"
"350",1139380,1142510,"I've retired more men than Social Security.","Rocky IV"
"351",1142520,1143890,"Excuse, please.","Rocky IV"
"352",1143900,1146490,"You are not very realistic.","Rocky IV"
"353",1146490,1147570,"Where did you come from?","Rocky IV"
"354",1147570,1148620,"What are you talking about?","Rocky IV"
"355",1148620,1149790,"You can box, yes,","Rocky IV"
"356",1149800,1152630,"but you are far too old to think you can win over Drago.","Rocky IV"
"357",1152630,1153820,"Is that a fact?","Rocky IV"
"358",1153830,1156020,"Yes, and it could be a painful one.","Rocky IV"
"359",1156030,1157830,"You put that heavy bag without balls in the ring with me","Rocky IV"
"360",1157830,1159700,"and you'll see the meaning of pain!","Rocky IV"
"361",1159700,1161360,"Why do you insult us?","Rocky IV"

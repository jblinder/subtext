"436",2120302,2122099,"I'm glad you approve.","Suspicion"
"437",2122271,2125728,"Yes, we must. We'll get together soon.I'll leave it up to Lina, shall I?","Suspicion"

"452",2197713,2200909,"I happened to be driving by.I thought I'd pop in for a cup of tea.","Suspicion"
"453",2200983,2202974,"I've heard so much about you,Mr. Thwaite.","Suspicion"
"454",2203050,2204608,"Johnnie told me about you, too.","Suspicion"

"464",2228143,2231873,"-I think so, too.-Won't you sit down?","Suspicion"
"465",2231947,2234710,"I don't see why not. Something wrong?","Suspicion"

"472",2258606,2260074,"Sold them? What for?","Suspicion"
"473",2260141,2263577,"For money, of course. A fellow's got to payhis racing debts, hasn't he?","Suspicion"
"474",2263644,2266807,"Johnnie dropped a packet of moneyat Newbury, I can tell you that.","Suspicion"
"475",2266882,2270750,"These bookies don't trust a chap for long.Not a chap like Johnnie, that is.","Suspicion"

"477",2274255,2275985,"Put my foot in it again, have I?","Suspicion"
"478",2276057,2280552,"My dear, you mustn't take it so seriously.After all, it's Johnnie.","Suspicion"
"479",2281163,2285394,"Wonderful chap, there's nobody like him.But I needn't tell you that.","Suspicion"
"480",2285567,2289731,"He couldn't have sold them.He wouldn't, without asking me.","Suspicion"
"481",2290304,2293103,"Here he comes.Don't tell him I've said a word.","Suspicion"
"482",2293175,2295302,"If you want to see Johnnieat his very best...","Suspicion"
"483",2295376,2298777,"just say something about chairs.He doesn't need more than one second...","Suspicion"
"484",2298847,2300905,"to invent the most howling lieyou ever heard.","Suspicion"
"485",2300983,2303713,"I wouldn't have missed thisfor anything in the world.","Suspicion"
"486",2304119,2306518,"-Beaky.-Johnnie, how are you?","Suspicion"

"496",2335751,2339380,"About those chairs, old bean?The missing chairs, old man.","Suspicion"
"497",2339855,2341322,"Yes, the chairs.","Suspicion"
"498",2341389,2343789,"I imagine the American cameto get them this morning.","Suspicion"
"499",2343858,2344916,"What American?","Suspicion"
"500",2344992,2348291,"Didn't I tell you about him, darling?How stupid of me.","Suspicion"

"502",2352099,2353590,"I think you were out riding.","Suspicion"
"503",2354036,2355264,"Go on, old man.","Suspicion"
"504",2356570,2359664,"Anyway, he admired the chairs.Extravagant fellow.","Suspicion"
"505",2359740,2363177,"Offered £100 apiece for them.Can you imagine? Anyone would take that.","Suspicion"
"506",2364246,2365644,"I wouldn't.","Suspicion"
"507",2367581,2369606,"Wouldn't you really, dear?","Suspicion"
"508",2370485,2372282,"That never occurred to me.","Suspicion"
"509",2373655,2375849,"As a matter of fact, I told him you would.","Suspicion"
"510",2376425,2378449,"Why didn't you mention it?","Suspicion"
"511",2378693,2380956,"I'm sorry, darling, but I thought I did.","Suspicion"
"512",2381028,2384123,"That's all right.If they're gone, they're gone.","Suspicion"
"513",2384231,2386199,"They're gone, all right.","Suspicion"
"514",2386501,2388594,"Shall we change for dinner?","Suspicion"

"518",2398646,2401240,"-He'll send it along.-I bet you £10 to a shilling...","Suspicion"
"519",2401315,2404717,"you wouldn't dare let your wife pick upthe telephone and ask Melbeck...","Suspicion"
"520",2404786,2406913,"if he ever saw this American.","Suspicion"
"521",2406987,2409922,"Are you implyingthat my husband is a liar?","Suspicion"
"522",2409990,2412925,"Don't mind Beaky, he's only joking.","Suspicion"
"523",2413360,2415760,"I prefer jokes on other subjects.","Suspicion"
"524",2415996,2418123,"Are you staying for dinner?","Suspicion"
"525",2418233,2421429,"I'm spending the weekendunless you throw me out.","Suspicion"

"743",3379025,3381927,"Wonderful. We could putthe large hotel there.","Suspicion"

"770",3466246,3469876,"I've got something on now.I can pay you back in a couple of weeks.","Suspicion"
"771",3470251,3473378,"We buy up this landand then we sell part of it.","Suspicion"
"772",3473454,3475978,"That gives us a 100% profit in no time.","Suspicion"
"773",3476056,3479081,"On the other part,we build something or other.","Suspicion"
"774",3479159,3482288,"But from whom do you buy the land?How much do you pay for it?","Suspicion"
"775",3482362,3485798,"-To whom do you sell it?-That shouldn't be difficult.","Suspicion"
"776",3486666,3488998,"Isn't it about time you grew up?","Suspicion"
"777",3489170,3491967,"-You're scolding me.-You need a scolding.","Suspicion"
"778",3492273,3493672,"-Do I?-Yes, you do.","Suspicion"
"779",3493740,3496231,"Shall I go and stand in the corner?","Suspicion"

"783",3508856,3510755,"What's wrong with that?","Suspicion"
"784",3511458,3515621,"Old bean, Lina's been telling meyou're a bit soft in the head. Is that it?","Suspicion"
"785",3515695,3519291,"-It sounded like that.-Come now, that's not very wifely.","Suspicion"

"791",3541621,3543351,"You were only what?","Suspicion"
"792",3543423,3547018,"I was only trying to tell Beakythat he shouldn't leave everything to you...","Suspicion"
"793",3547094,3550824,"because if something went wrong,he should take a little responsibility, too.","Suspicion"
"794",3551065,3554364,"It's not as if you're bothexperienced businessmen.","Suspicion"
"795",3554934,3558893,"-What do you know about business?-Very little. I was only--","Suspicion"
"796",3558972,3560735,"Suppose Beaky had taken you seriously?","Suspicion"
"797",3560807,3563208,"You'd have ruined the whole scheme,you realize that?","Suspicion"
"798",3563277,3567179,"-But if it weren't any good....-That's my business, not yours.","Suspicion"

"808",3605347,3607838,"-No, not yet.-Why are you doing it?","Suspicion"
"809",3608518,3611954,"I don't know. Perhaps the landisn't any good. Who knows?","Suspicion"
"810",3612021,3615548,"Or perhaps I don't like the ideaof risking Beaky's money.","Suspicion"
"811",3615625,3618617,"Or perhaps it's a stiff job and I'm too lazy.","Suspicion"
"812",3619996,3623625,"-Are you still angry about last night?-No, I'm not angry.","Suspicion"
"813",3624034,3627231,"Are you sure?Because I couldn't sleep all night.","Suspicion"

"831",3691867,3695030,"You have to go up thereearly tomorrow morning and take a look.","Suspicion"
"832",3695105,3697096,"Why are you so insistent?","Suspicion"

"1058",4904479,4906412,"Yes, I will. Thank you.","Suspicion"
"1059",4930305,4933832,"-Good morning, madam.-Good morning. Are there any letters?","Suspicion"
"1060",4933908,4937572,"Just three for Mr. Aysgarthand a magazine for you, ma'am.","Suspicion"

"1065",5015489,5018390,"-Well, well, well.-Good news?","Suspicion"
"1066",5018859,5021795,"Got a letter from old Spotty.He's going to India.","Suspicion"
"1067",5023564,5025157,"What a life.","Suspicion"
"1068",5025567,5028399,"Says he wishes he had timeto pop down and see us.","Suspicion"
"1069",5029438,5032805,"That'd be a dream. Poor old Spotty.","Suspicion"
"1070",5035577,5038841,"-Do you mind if I take my bath before you?-No, dear.","Suspicion"
"1071",5052594,5056462,"May I have some more soap,Monkeyface? This bit's nearly gone.","Suspicion"
"1072",5057431,5060457,"Yes, there's some in the cupboardabove the washbasin.","Suspicion"
"1073",5083859,5087795,"-Darling, you're not shivering, are you?-I've a bit of a chill.","Suspicion"
"1074",5088063,5090997,"Cold in all this sunshine?Let me warm you up.","Suspicion"
"1075",5091666,5094760,"My poor little shivering baby.How do you feel now? Better?","Suspicion"
"1076",5094836,5097828,"-Much.-Good. Perhaps this will help.","Suspicion"
"1077",5102577,5106774,"-Darling, what are we doing tonight?-We're going to Isobel's to dine.","Suspicion"
"1078",5107248,5108443,"What a bore.","Suspicion"
"1079",5121395,5123761,"Issie, let's get backto that new book of yours.","Suspicion"
"1080",5123832,5128599,"The fellow comes into the room, locks it,and starts to strum on the piano...","Suspicion"
"1081",5128670,5131662,"then somebody shoots himthrough the locked door? That the idea?","Suspicion"
"1082",5132541,5136271,"That doesn't make sense. Why would helock the door just to play the piano?","Suspicion"
"1083",5136344,5137833,"Was he ashamed of his playing?","Suspicion"
"1084",5137912,5139436,"I arranged it this way.","Suspicion"
"1085",5139514,5143472,"A certain note on the piano was wired toa revolver concealed in the wall paneling.","Suspicion"
"1086",5143551,5146680,"When the victim struck this note....There you are.","Suspicion"
"1087",5147622,5150488,"I don't care much for that.You're slipping, old girl.","Suspicion"
"1088",5150559,5153460,"-What's wrong with it, my dear chap?-That's too complicated.","Suspicion"
"1089",5153528,5156326,"If you're going to kill somebody,do it simply.","Suspicion"
"1090",5156398,5158092,"Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk?","Suspicion"
"1091",5158166,5161430,"You're right.Just as long as you don't get caught.","Suspicion"
"1092",5161502,5163993,"-Do the wine, will you?-Yes, Issie.","Suspicion"
"1093",5164805,5166466,"How would you do it simply?","Suspicion"
"1094",5166541,5169703,"I don't know, dear.I'd use the most obvious method.","Suspicion"
"1095",5169778,5172439,"The most important thingis that no one should suspect me.","Suspicion"
"1096",5172514,5175744,"-For instance?-For instance, poison.","Suspicion"
"1097",5176083,5179417,"Just use the first onethat came to my mind. Say, arsenic.","Suspicion"
"1098",5180689,5181917,"Arsenic.","Suspicion"
"1099",5182556,5184046,"I remember...","Suspicion"
"1100",5184693,5188628,"in Gloucester, wherewe exhumed the body four years after...","Suspicion"
"1101",5188697,5192895,"there was still enough poison,even in the fingernails and the hair.","Suspicion"
"1102",5193135,5195729,"Yes, but did you get the murderer?","Suspicion"
"1103",5196938,5198337,"Let me see.","Suspicion"
"1104",5198974,5200305,"No, I don't think we did.","Suspicion"
"1105",5200375,5201534,"There you are.","Suspicion"
"1106",5201609,5204601,"Think of it. This very minute,there are hundreds of people...","Suspicion"
"1107",5204679,5207613,"who have committed murderand they're walking about freely.","Suspicion"
"1108",5207681,5208944,"Thousands.","Suspicion"
"1109",5209016,5211814,"Do you supposethose murderers are happy, Johnnie?","Suspicion"
"1110",5211886,5214377,"I don't know, dear.I don't see why they shouldn't be.","Suspicion"
"1111",5214456,5216082,"Fear of discovery, my lad.","Suspicion"
"1112",5216158,5220060,"So long as arsenic leaves traces anda bullet's marked by the barrel of a gun...","Suspicion"
"1113",5220127,5222688,"and the tiniest hair of your headcan be identified....","Suspicion"
"1114",5222764,5227029,"It seems to me by now someone would'vediscovered a poison that can't be traced.","Suspicion"
"1115",5230872,5232498,"What about it, Doctor?","Suspicion"
"1116",5233742,5236141,"A very interesting corpsedropped in the other day.","Suspicion"
"1117",5236211,5240113,"-Do let's hear about it.-No, please. Don't change the subject.","Suspicion"
"1118",5240181,5244175,"I saw that look that passed between you.There's an untraceable poison, isn't there?","Suspicion"
"1119",5244252,5246220,"Nonsense. No such thing.","Suspicion"
"1120",5246688,5249417,"I'll bet you know, Doctor. What is it?","Suspicion"
"1121",5249791,5251690,"Not in a million years.","Suspicion"
"1122",5251760,5254922,"Now, come.After all, do I look like a murderer?","Suspicion"
"1123",5254996,5257863,"That's an interesting question.What do you think, Issie?","Suspicion"
"1124",5257932,5262131,"Issie can tell by looking at a person's facewhether he or she is capable of murder.","Suspicion"
"1125",5262203,5263363,"Can't you, Issie?","Suspicion"
"1126",5263438,5266532,"I don't want to sound conceited,but I usually can.","Suspicion"
"1127",5266608,5268507,"What about me, dear?Could I murder anyone?","Suspicion"
"1128",5268577,5271603,"You couldn't hurt a fly, Bertram.Unless it was already dead.","Suspicion"
"1129",5271680,5275672,"What about Mrs. Aysgarth?She has a strange glint in her eye.","Suspicion"
"1130",5275750,5279447,"I'm afraid not. Lina hasn't the nerveany more than I have.","Suspicion"
"1131",5279688,5282885,"As for you, you silly thing.Look at the expression on his face.","Suspicion"
"1132",5282957,5286416,"Trying to look mysterious, are you?You can't fool me.","Suspicion"
"1133",5286493,5290055,"You couldn't commit a murderif you tried for 100 years.","Suspicion"
"1134",5293068,5295229,"No, I don't believe I could.","Suspicion"
"1135",5299640,5302201,"Johnnie, you're locking up.What about Ethel?","Suspicion"
"1136",5303043,5306207,"It's Ethel's day off.She won't be back until morning.","Suspicion"
"1137",5306514,5308105,"What about Cook?","Suspicion"
"1138",5308182,5310150,"What's the matter, dear?Have you forgotten?","Suspicion"
"1139",5310217,5312243,"Cook's away on a holiday.","Suspicion"
"1140",5347454,5351390,"Darling, you're shivering again.Do you suppose you're catching cold?","Suspicion"
"1141",5351458,5353256,"Yes. I think that's what it must be.","Suspicion"
"1142",5353328,5355989,"We have to tuck you into bed.Get you nice and warm.","Suspicion"
"1143",5356064,5358793,"-Take off your coat.-No, Johnnie. Please don't.","Suspicion"
"1144",5360502,5363630,"This reminds me of the day we first meton the top of the hill...","Suspicion"
"1145",5363704,5366697,"when you wouldn't let me unbuttonthe top button of your blouse.","Suspicion"
"1146",5366774,5368367,"Do you remember?","Suspicion"
"1147",5371078,5373069,"I shall never forget it.","Suspicion"
"1148",5376551,5379542,"Get undressed, old girl.What are you waiting for?","Suspicion"
"1149",5379621,5384024,"Johnnie, I'm in a state tonight.I don't know why. I'd like to be alone.","Suspicion"
"1150",5384225,5387057,"Would you mind sleepingin your dressing room?","Suspicion"
"1151",5389863,5391627,"Of course I'd mind.","Suspicion"
"1152",5394402,5397632,"Please, Johnnie.I haven't been sleeping very well lately.","Suspicion"
"1153",5397838,5399328,"I understand.","Suspicion"
"1154",5399573,5403032,"You used to sleep badlywhen I wasn't here, and now you....","Suspicion"
"1155",5404445,5407938,"All right, if that's how you feel about it.Good night.","Suspicion"
"1156",5435109,5436667,"Feeling better?","Suspicion"
"1157",5437145,5438703,"Yes, thank you.","Suspicion"
"1158",5440614,5442775,"-Hello, Isobel.-How are you, my dear?","Suspicion"
"1159",5442850,5444216,"All right.","Suspicion"
"1160",5445520,5448079,"I've been asleep all day, haven't I?","Suspicion"
"1161",5448722,5451283,"Isobel's brother gave youa sleeping pill this morning.","Suspicion"
"1162",5451359,5453554,"Your nerves seemed to be all upset.","Suspicion"
"1163",5454194,5456128,"We were quite worried about you.","Suspicion"
"1164",5456197,5458256,"Cheer up. Bertram had a good look at you.","Suspicion"
"1165",5458332,5462292,"Although he doesn't usually attendliving people, he's a very able doctor.","Suspicion"
"1166",5462369,5465100,"He says all you needed was a little sleep.","Suspicion"
"1167",5465472,5469136,"I'll run down and tell Ethelto fix something for your supper.","Suspicion"
"1168",5473280,5475545,"He's one in a million,that Johnnie of yours.","Suspicion"
"1169",5475617,5476743,"Isn't he?","Suspicion"
"1170",5476818,5478717,"Do you mind if I smoke?","Suspicion"
"1171",5478787,5480253,"Have you been here all afternoon?","Suspicion"
"1172",5480320,5482914,"Naturally. Ever since Johnnie phoned.","Suspicion"
"1173",5482990,5484652,"I warn you. You'd better get well.","Suspicion"
"1174",5484725,5487627,"If you leave me alone much longerwith this husband of yours...","Suspicion"
"1175",5487694,5489185,"my career will soon be over.","Suspicion"
"1176",5489264,5492721,"-He flirted with you, I suppose.-Flirted? Worse than that.","Suspicion"
"1177",5492801,5495326,"He's worming all my secrets out of me.","Suspicion"
"1178",5495403,5498565,"I suspect him of writinga detective story on the side.","Suspicion"
"1179",5500108,5501666,"What secrets?","Suspicion"
"1180",5501743,5503768,"He's always pestering me.","Suspicion"
"1181",5503845,5506712,"I always swear I won't tell himand I always do.","Suspicion"
"1182",5507282,5509113,"Did you tell him anything today?","Suspicion"
"1183",5509184,5513347,"Did I? Bertram was furious.Said he'd never confide in me again.","Suspicion"
"1184",5513988,5517980,"But honestly, have you ever been ableto deny Johnnie anything?","Suspicion"
"1185",5519027,5520391,"Never.","Suspicion"
"1186",5521095,5522994,"It was about that poison, wasn't it?","Suspicion"
"1187",5523064,5526726,"Don't remind me of it. I'm ashamed,and mortified, and disgraced.","Suspicion"
"1188",5526801,5530998,"I'm just a fool, that's all. If he writesa story on that one before I do...","Suspicion"
"1189",5531072,5532971,"I suppose I'll deserve it.","Suspicion"
"1190",5533041,5536373,"Imagine. A substancein daily use everywhere.","Suspicion"
"1191",5536877,5538778,"Anyone can lay his hands on it.","Suspicion"
"1192",5538846,5543078,"And within a minute after taking,the victim's beautifully out of the way.","Suspicion"
"1193",5543150,5546143,"Mind you, it's undetectable after death.","Suspicion"
"1194",5547988,5550617,"Is whatever it is painful?","Suspicion"
"1195",5550692,5552250,"Not in the least.","Suspicion"
"1196",5552327,5555887,"In fact, I should thinkit would be a most pleasant death.","Suspicion"
"1197",5629938,5631599,"Good night, Lina.","Suspicion"
"1198",5669543,5672137,"You're still annoyed with me, aren't you?","Suspicion"
"1199",5672212,5675204,"No, Johnnie, really. I still don't feel well.","Suspicion"
"1200",5675283,5678719,"A few days at your mother's housewill do more good than staying at home.","Suspicion"
"1201",5678786,5682186,"It's not exactly that. Don't youunderstand? Mother telephoned me and--","Suspicion"
"1202",5682256,5684815,"She got on that telephoneawfully early, it seems to me.","Suspicion"
"1203",5684891,5688190,"Mother gets up early,and she's lonely down there.","Suspicion"
"1204",5688261,5690627,"I happened to mention I was a bit nervy...","Suspicion"
"1205",5690698,5694064,"and before I knew it I'd agreedto spend a few days with her.","Suspicion"
"1206",5694402,5696801,"All right.I'll run down and get the car ready.","Suspicion"
"1207",5696871,5699863,"-No. I'll drive myself.-I prefer to drive you.","Suspicion"
"1208",5762436,5764631,"I think I'll take the short cut.","Suspicion"
"1209",5770078,5771203,"Johnnie!","Suspicion"
"1210",5773213,5775238,"Johnnie!","Suspicion"
"1211",5780454,5782389,"Lina, what's got into you?","Suspicion"
"1212",5782457,5786416,"Lina! Stop it, you little fool!","Suspicion"
"1213",5786627,5789686,"I've had enough! How much do you thinka man can bear? Listen to me!","Suspicion"
"1214",5789764,5792288,"You throw me out of your room,run off to your mother's...","Suspicion"
"1215",5792365,5795460,"now you shrink away from meas though you hated me. You're my wife.","Suspicion"
"1216",5795536,5797127,"You almost killed us both back there.","Suspicion"
"1217",5797204,5801766,"You pulled away when I was reaching overto save you from falling out of the car.","Suspicion"
"1218",5803344,5805743,"You don't have toput up with me anymore.","Suspicion"
"1219",5806480,5808676,"Johnnie, where are you going?","Suspicion"
"1220",5809216,5812345,"-First, I'm taking you to your mother's.-And then what?","Suspicion"
"1221",5812453,5814784,"Don't worry. I won't bother you again.","Suspicion"
"1222",5816356,5818518,"Johnnie, you mean you're going to....","Suspicion"
"1223",5818592,5821960,"Why were you asking Isobelthose questions about the poison?","Suspicion"
"1224",5822029,5823894,"What were you planning to do with it?","Suspicion"
"1225",5823965,5825989,"Johnnie, you were going to kill yourself.","Suspicion"
"1226",5826067,5828194,"My darling.","Suspicion"
"1227",5828435,5831166,"Yes, but I saw that was a cheap way out.","Suspicion"
"1228",5831238,5833832,"I'm going to see it through,prison term and everything.","Suspicion"
"1229",5833908,5836432,"Prison? You mean Melbeck,that money you took?","Suspicion"
"1230",5836511,5837909,"I can't pay it back.","Suspicion"
"1231",5837979,5841210,"I made the last attempt to raise the moneywhen I went away with Beaky.","Suspicion"
"1232",5841282,5843250,"-Paris?-I went to Liverpool.","Suspicion"
"1233",5843317,5846844,"I tried to borrow on your insurance,but it didn't work.","Suspicion"
"1234",5847087,5849283,"You were in Liverpool when Beaky....","Suspicion"
"1235",5849356,5851587,"Then you didn't go to Paris.","Suspicion"
"1236",5851658,5852784,"Of course not.","Suspicion"
"1237",5852859,5856626,"You think I'd have let some idiotgive poor old Beaky that brandy if I had?","Suspicion"
"1238",5857765,5861895,"Johnnie, if I'd only known.This is as much my fault as yours.","Suspicion"
"1239",5862636,5866073,"I was only thinking of myself,not what you were going through.","Suspicion"
"1240",5866140,5869074,"If I'd been really close to you,you could've confided in me...","Suspicion"
"1241",5869143,5872270,"but you were afraid to.You were ashamed to come to me.","Suspicion"
"1242",5872345,5874279,"If I'd only understood.","Suspicion"
"1243",5877083,5880109,"But it will be different now.We'll make it different.","Suspicion"
"1244",5881021,5884149,"People don't change overnight, Lina.I'm no good.","Suspicion"
"1245",5884992,5888587,"Let's turn back. Let's go homeand see it all through together.","Suspicion"
"1246",5888662,5891359,"No. It won't work.I'm driving you on to your mother's.","Suspicion"
"1247",5891431,5894595,"It will work. I know it will, Johnnie, please.","Suspicion"
"1248",5894868,5896996,"This isn't your problem, Lina.","Suspicion"
"1249",5897537,5899664,"But it is. You can't shut me out.","Suspicion"
"1250",5899739,5903368,"Turn the car around and let's go home.Please, Johnnie.","Suspicion"
"1251",5904110,5905771,"No, Lina.","Suspicion"
"1252",5907881,5909372,"My darling.","Suspicion"

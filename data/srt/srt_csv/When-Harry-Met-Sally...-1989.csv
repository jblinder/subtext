"150",719399,722150,"- Why not?- What I'm saying is,","When Harry Met Sally..."
"151",722316,725238,"and this is not a come-onin any way, shape or form,","When Harry Met Sally..."
"152",725363,730284,"is that men and women can't be friends,cos the sex part always gets in the way.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"153",731784,736123,"That's not true. I have a number ofmen friends and there is no sex involved.","When Harry Met Sally..."

"161",749888,750888,"How do you know?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"162",751013,754142,"No man can be friendswith a woman he finds attractive.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"163",754267,756979,"He always wants to have sex with her.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"164",757104,761231,"So you're saying a man can be friendswith a woman he finds unattractive.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"165",761524,764403,"No, you pretty muchwanna nail them, too.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"166",766070,768157,"What if they don't wanna have sex?","When Harry Met Sally..."

"295",1306330,1309584,"That doesn't work either.The person you're with can't see","When Harry Met Sally..."
"296",1309711,1312171,"why you need to be friendswith the person,","When Harry Met Sally..."
"297",1312296,1315799,"like it means somethingis missing from the relationship.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"298",1315924,1319679,"Then when you say ""No, nothingis missing"", the person you're with","When Harry Met Sally..."
"299",1319846,1323766,"accuses you of being attractedto the person you're just friends with,","When Harry Met Sally..."
"300",1323932,1326685,"which you probably are.I mean, let's face it.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"301",1326811,1329188,"So we're back to the rulebefore the amendment:","When Harry Met Sally..."
"302",1329355,1332107,"men and women can't be friends.Where's it leave us?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"303",1332232,1333651,"- Harry.- What?","When Harry Met Sally..."

"358",1513376,1517047,"but who right now wouldjust be a transitional man.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"359",1517213,1521844,"OK, but don't wait too long. Rememberwhat happened with David Warsaw?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"360",1521968,1526681,"His wife left him and everyone said ""Givehim some time. Don't move in too fast.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"361",1526891,1529268,"Six months later he was dead.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"362",1529519,1533105,"Are you saying I should marry quicklyin case he's about to die?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"363",1533270,1535691,"At least you could say you were married.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"364",1535856,1541195,"I'm saying that the right man is out there.If you don't grab him, someone else will,","When Harry Met Sally..."
"365",1541364,1547035,"and you'll spend your life knowing thatsomeone else is married to your husband.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"366",1550288,1552500,"Ten! Hut!","When Harry Met Sally..."
"367",1566972,1570893,"- When did this happen?- Friday. Helen comes home from work","When Harry Met Sally..."
"368",1571060,1574480,"and she says ""I don't knowif I wanna be married any more.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"369",1574647,1580153,"Like it's the institution. Nothing personal,just something she's been thinking about.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"370",1580278,1584866,"I'm calm. I say ""Why don't we take time tothink about it? Don't rush into anything.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"371",1585034,1588162,"- Yeah, right.- Next day she says she's thought about it.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"372",1588327,1591705,"She wants a trial separation.She just wants to try it.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"373",1591873,1595170,"But we can still date -like this is supposed to cushion the blow.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"374",1595335,1599464,"I got married so I could stop dating,so still dating is not a big incentive","When Harry Met Sally..."
"375",1599631,1603260,"since the last thing you wanna dois date your wife, who should love you.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"376",1603427,1607056,"Which is what I'm saying to her,when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"377",1607221,1609974,"So I say to her""Don't you love me any more?""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"378",1610142,1613560,"D'you know what she says?""I don't know if I've ever loved you.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"379",1613728,1617775,"That's harsh. You don'tbounce back from that right away.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"380",1617901,1620861,"- Thanks, Jess.- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"381",1621028,1622613,"That's particularly harsh.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"382",1622779,1626034,"Then she says someone in her officeis going to South America","When Harry Met Sally..."
"383",1626201,1630788,"and she can sublet his apartment.I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"384",1630953,1635334,"""I can sublet his apartment"" - the wordsstill hang in the air like in a balloon...","When Harry Met Sally..."
"385",1635500,1637086,"- Like a cartoon.- Right.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"386",1637252,1642174,"So I go to the door and there are movingmen there. Now I start to get suspicious.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"387",1642343,1646053,"I say ""Helen, when did you callthese movers?"" She doesn't say anything.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"388",1646221,1649016,"So I ask the movers""When did this woman book you?""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"389",1649182,1654229,"And they're three huge guys. One witha T-shirt saying ""Don't fuck with Mr Zero.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"390",1654396,1659902,"So I said ""Helen, when did you make thisarrangement?"" She says ""A week ago.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"391",1660067,1663239,"I said ""You've known for a weekand you didn't tell me?""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"392",1663364,1666740,"And she says""I didn't wanna ruin your birthday.""","When Harry Met Sally..."
"393",1669076,1672207,"Mr Zero knew you were gettinga divorce a week before you?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"394",1672332,1674289,"- Mr Zero knew.- I can't believe this!","When Harry Met Sally..."
"395",1674415,1678796,"- I haven't told you the bad part yet.- What's worse than Mr Zero knowing?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"396",1678921,1680963,"It's all a lie.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"397",1681548,1685720,"She's in love with somebody else.Some tax attorney.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"398",1685845,1689848,"- She moved in with him.- How did you find out?","When Harry Met Sally..."
"399",1689973,1692268,"I followed her. Stood outside the building.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"400",1692393,1695188,"- That's so humiliating!- Tell me about it.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"401",1695394,1699775,"And, you know, I knew. I knew that eventhough we were happy, it was an illusion.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"402",1699900,1702403,"And that one dayshe'd kick the shit outta me.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"403",1702528,1707866,"Marriages don't break up due to infidelity.It's a symptom something else is wrong.","When Harry Met Sally..."
"404",1708201,1711162,"Oh, really?Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!","When Harry Met Sally..."
"405",1715541,1718877,"So I just happened to seehis American Express bill.","When Harry Met Sally..."

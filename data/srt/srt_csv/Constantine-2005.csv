"248",1811880,1815077,"Your health is bad for other reasons.How long?","Constantine"
"249",1815240,1816958,"A few months, maybe a year.","Constantine"
"250",1817120,1819680,"I thought I heard thunder last night.","Constantine"
"251",1819920,1822832,"Must have beenSatan's stomach growling.","Constantine"
"252",1824320,1826959,"You're the one soul he'd comeup here himself to collect.","Constantine"
"253",1827120,1829350,"So I've heard.","Constantine"
"254",1830120,1832680,"Well, I am most certainyou did not come here...","Constantine"
"255",1832840,1835877,"...for a sympathetic shoulderto cry on.","Constantine"
"256",1838320,1841710,"A demon just attacked me,right out in the open on Figueroa.","Constantine"

"258",1844200,1845997,"How many have youdeported back to hell?","Constantine"
"259",1846160,1850517,"Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.","Constantine"
"260",1850680,1853319,"Clearly I do not have to remind youthat is impossible.","Constantine"
"261",1853480,1855710,"And yesterday I saw a soldier demon...","Constantine"

"301",2062960,2067636,"She was a patient at Ravenscar.She jumped off the roof.","Constantine"
"302",2068280,2070157,"Thought you said she was murdered.","Constantine"
"303",2070320,2073198,"Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn'thave taken her own life.","Constantine"
"304",2073360,2076875,"Yeah, what kind of mental patientkills herself?","Constantine"
"305",2077680,2079830,"That's just crazy.","Constantine"
"306",2083600,2087388,"Look, I've heard your namearound the precinct.","Constantine"
"307",2087560,2092554,"I know the circles you travel in.The occult, demonology, exorcisms.","Constantine"
"308",2092720,2096190,"Just before my sister was committed,she became deeply paranoid.","Constantine"
"309",2096360,2100876,"She started talking about demons,angels.","Constantine"
"310",2101040,2103679,"Now, I think someone got to her,Mr. Constantine.","Constantine"
"311",2103840,2107469,"I think they brainwashed herinto stepping off that roof.","Constantine"
"312",2107640,2111918,"Some kind of legion or cult.","Constantine"
"313",2112200,2114919,"Sounds like a theory, detective.","Constantine"
"314",2115080,2116433,"Good luck.","Constantine"
"315",2118680,2121114,"I thought with your background,you could at least...","Constantine"
"316",2121280,2122872,"...point me in the right direction.","Constantine"
"317",2123040,2125270,"Yeah, okay, sure.","Constantine"
"318",2128400,2130391,"It wasn't a suicide.","Constantine"
"319",2130560,2132630,"My sister was a devout Catholic.","Constantine"
"320",2132800,2135189,"Do you understand that?If she took her own life...","Constantine"
"321",2135360,2138033,"Her soul would go straight to hell...","Constantine"
"322",2138200,2143115,"...where she'd be ripped apart overand over in screaming, brutal agony...","Constantine"
"323",2143280,2146397,"...for all eternity. That it?","Constantine"
"324",2146560,2148516,"That about right?","Constantine"
"325",2155200,2157236,"Goddamn you.","Constantine"
"326",2186320,2187753,"Detective.","Constantine"
"327",2187920,2190639,"What if I told you that Godand the devil made a wager...","Constantine"
"328",2190800,2194156,"...a kind of standing betfor the souls of all mankind?","Constantine"
"329",2194320,2196709,"I'd tell you to stay on your meds.","Constantine"
"330",2196880,2200998,"Humor me. No direct contact withhumans. That would be the rule.","Constantine"
"331",2201320,2205359,"- Just influence. See who would win.- Okay, I'm humoring you.","Constantine"
"332",2205520,2207511,"- Why?- Who knows.","Constantine"
"333",2207680,2210638,"- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.- Oh, so it's fun.","Constantine"
"334",2210800,2215590,"It's fun when a man beats his wife todeath, when a mother drowns her baby.","Constantine"
"335",2215760,2219355,"And you think the devil is responsible?","Constantine"
"336",2219520,2222159,"People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.","Constantine"
"337",2222320,2225630,"You're right. We're borncapable of terrible things.","Constantine"
"338",2225800,2229395,"Then sometimes something else comesalong and gives us just the right nudge.","Constantine"
"339",2229560,2232870,"Well, this has been real educational...","Constantine"
"340",2233040,2234678,"...but I don't believe in the devil.","Constantine"
"341",2234840,2238150,"You should. He believes in you.","Constantine"
"342",2257480,2259596,"It's a power outage.","Constantine"
"343",2259760,2261637,"Not likely.","Constantine"
"344",2264160,2267436,"- What?- We should go. Now.","Constantine"
"345",2272360,2274271,"What is that?","Constantine"
"346",2275320,2276992,"Wings.","Constantine"
"347",2277520,2279795,"Maybe talons.","Constantine"
"348",2280120,2282714,"You're kidding. Of what?","Constantine"
"349",2283680,2286558,"Something that's notsupposed to be here.","Constantine"
"350",2290320,2292834,"That's really not going to help.","Constantine"
"351",2297240,2299800,"- Close your eyes.- Why?","Constantine"
"352",2299960,2301234,"Suit yourself.","Constantine"
"353",2322800,2325837,"Demons stay in hell, huh?","Constantine"
"354",2327120,2329111,"Tell them that.","Constantine"
"355",2331160,2335836,"Don't worry. Happens to everyonethe first time.","Constantine"
"356",2336080,2338036,"It's the sulfur.","Constantine"
"357",2338600,2340511,"Sulfur.","Constantine"
"358",2342640,2344949,"What were those things?","Constantine"
"359",2346160,2347878,"Demons.","Constantine"

"361",2354000,2357629,"Yeah. And I don't thinkthey were after me.","Constantine"
"362",2359680,2362592,"You really believeshe wouldn't commit suicide.","Constantine"
"363",2362760,2364113,"Isabel?","Constantine"
"364",2364880,2366871,"Never in a million years.","Constantine"
"365",2367240,2369231,"Well, let's be sure.","Constantine"
"366",2369440,2371829,"Let's see if she's in hell.","Constantine"

"368",2397840,2399910,"In front of the chair.","Constantine"
"369",2402680,2404432,"I can't believe I'm doing this.","Constantine"
"370",2404600,2407114,"- These are all Isabel's things?- Yeah.","Constantine"

"373",2413720,2414994,"Duck.","Constantine"
"374",2415160,2417390,"Oh, you think that's strange.","Constantine"
"375",2417560,2418959,"Cats are good.","Constantine"
"376",2419120,2420678,"Half in, half out anyway.","Constantine"
"377",2438240,2441312,"If this is some kind of spellor something...","Constantine"
"378",2441480,2444517,"...don't you need candlesand a pentagram for it to work?","Constantine"

"410",2955720,2958678,"Officially, I was dead for two minutes.","Constantine"

"459",3186960,3189315,"She certainly did that.","Constantine"
"460",3189520,3192876,"She'd tell everyone about the thingsshe said she saw.","Constantine"

"1295",4925760,4929719,"I think I know Leon quite as weII as you.Perhaps a IittIe better.","Ninotchka"
"1296",4929797,4931355,"Leave that worry to me.","Ninotchka"
"1297",4931432,4935766,"Now, 5:40 Ieaves you time enoughto cIose the deaI with Monsieur Mercier...","Ninotchka"

"1312",5013648,5015377,"Maybe you're right.","Ninotchka"
"1313",5015716,5017843,"Perhaps it is the champagne.","Ninotchka"

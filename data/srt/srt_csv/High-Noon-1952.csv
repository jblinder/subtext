"420",2707503,2710297,"let's make sure we knowwhat this is all about.","High Noon"
"421",2711298,2716137,"What I want to know is this: ain't it truethat Kane ain't no longer a marshal?","High Noon"
"422",2717554,2721099,"And that there's personal troublewith Kane and Miller?","High Noon"
"423",2725896,2729523,"All right, allright!Quiet, everybody!","High Noon"
"424",2729733,2732652,"If there's a difference of opinion,let everybody have a say.","High Noon"
"425",2732902,2737114,"But let's do it like grown-up people,and get the kids out of the building.","High Noon"
"426",2769768,2773688,"- Anything on the train?- It's on time as far as I know, sir.","High Noon"
"427",2778652,2783155,"It don't really matter if there's anythingpersonal between Miller and Kane.","High Noon"
"428",2783364,2785949,"We all know who Miller is,and what Miller is.","High Noon"
"429",2786117,2790954,"- We're wasting time.- All right Coy!","High Noon"
"430",2791621,2795291,"We all know who Miller isand we put him away once.","High Noon"
"431",2795543,2798836,"And who saved him from hanging?The politicians up north.","High Noon"
"432",2799045,2802632,"I say, this is their mess.Let them take care of it.","High Noon"
"433",2802840,2805135,"- Fryer?- Well, I say this:","High Noon"
"434",2805342,2808554,"We've been paying good moneyfor a marshal and deputies.","High Noon"
"435",2808804,2812557,"The first time there's any trouble, we'resupposed to take care of it ourselves.","High Noon"
"436",2812766,2814726,"What have we been paying forall this time?","High Noon"
"437",2814934,2818271,"We're not peace officers,and this ain't our job!","High Noon"
"438",2819606,2822400,"I've been saying right along,we ought to have more deputies.","High Noon"
"439",2822608,2826278,"If we did, we wouldn't be facing this now.","High Noon"
"440",2826445,2830115,"Just a minute, just a minute!Everybody, quiet!","High Noon"
"441",2830282,2833034,"Keep it orderly.You had your hand up.","High Noon"
"442",2834036,2836454,"I can't believe I've heardsome of the things said here.","High Noon"
"443",2836664,2838414,"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.","High Noon"
"444",2838623,2841918,"We paid this man,and he was the best marshal we ever had.","High Noon"
"445",2842126,2844253,"It ain't his trouble, it's ours.","High Noon"
"446",2844461,2847465,"If we don't do what's right,we're gonna have more trouble.","High Noon"
"447",2847632,2851594,"There ain't but one thing to do,and you all know what that is.","High Noon"
"448",2851802,2855139,"- Go ahead, Kibbee.- This thing has been handled wrong.","High Noon"
"449",2855347,2858266,"Those three killerswalking the streets bold as brass...","High Noon"
"450",2858474,2861978,"Why didn't you put them in jailwhere they ought to be?","High Noon"
"451",2862186,2864731,"Then we'd only have Miller to worry about.","High Noon"
"452",2864940,2868943,"I haven't anything to arrest them for.They haven't done anything.","High Noon"
"453",2869152,2871820,"There's no law against themsitting on a bench at the depot.","High Noon"
"454",2872780,2876742,"I can't listen to any more of this.What's the matter with you people?","High Noon"
"455",2876951,2880913,"Remember when a decent woman couldn'twalk down the street in broad daylight?","High Noon"
"456",2881121,2884331,"When this wasn't a fit placeto bring up a child?","High Noon"
"457",2884583,2888210,"How can you sit and talk, and talk,and talk like this?","High Noon"
"458",2888418,2892797,"What are we getting so excited about?How do we know Miller's on that train?","High Noon"
"459",2893590,2898387,"We can be pretty sure he's on it.Time's getting short.","High Noon"
"460",2899721,2904099,"- Parson, you got anything to say?- I don't know.","High Noon"
"461",2904309,2907019,"The commandment says""thou shalt not kill""","High Noon"
"462",2907269,2909896,"but we hire men to do it for us.","High Noon"
"463",2910106,2913317,"The right and the wrongseem pretty clear here,","High Noon"
"464",2913483,2916152,"but if I should tell my peopleto go out and kill,","High Noon"
"465",2916362,2923492,"and maybe get themselves killed, I'm sorry,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.","High Noon"
"466",2924286,2926621,"All right, I'll say this.","High Noon"
"467",2926788,2931833,"What this town owes Will Kane, it can neverpay with money. Don't forget it.","High Noon"
"468",2932043,2935880,"He's the best marshal we've ever had,and maybe the best we'll ever have.","High Noon"
"469",2936045,2940634,"So if Miller comes back here today,it's our problem, not his.","High Noon"
"470",2940800,2943762,"It's our problembecause this is our town.","High Noon"
"471",2944012,2946264,"We made it with our own hands,out of nothing.","High Noon"
"472",2946431,2950768,"If we want to keep it decentwe gotta think mighty clear today.","High Noon"
"473",2950976,2955438,"We gotta have the courage to dowhat is right, no matter how hard it is.","High Noon"
"474",2955606,2960318,"All right! There's gonna be fightingwhen Kane and Miller meet.","High Noon"
"475",2960527,2963697,"And somebody's going to get hurt,that's for sure.","High Noon"
"476",2963905,2968534,"Now... People up northare thinking about this town.","High Noon"
"477",2968742,2974914,"Thinking about sending money down here,to put up stores and factories.","High Noon"
"478",2975123,2978418,"It would mean a lot to this town,an awful lot,","High Noon"
"479",2978626,2984590,"but if they'll read about shooting in thestreets, what are they going to think?","High Noon"
"480",2984798,2989554,"I'll tell you. They'll thinkthis is just another wide-open town,","High Noon"
"481",2989804,2992389,"and everything we worked forwill be wiped out.","High Noon"
"482",2992556,2997518,"In one day, this townwill be sat back five years,","High Noon"
"483",2997686,3000355,"and I don't think we can let that happen.","High Noon"
"484",3000521,3004233,"Mind you, you all knowhow I feel about this man.","High Noon"
"485",3004442,3009572,"He's a mighty brave man, a good man.He didn't have to come back today.","High Noon"
"486",3010447,3015494,"And for his sake, and a sake of this town,I wish he hadn't.","High Noon"
"487",3015744,3017954,"Because if he's not here when Miller comes,","High Noon"
"488",3018163,3021333,"my hunch is,there won't be any trouble, not one bit.","High Noon"
"489",3021500,3026463,"Tomorrow we'll have a new marshaland if we offer him our services,","High Noon"
"490",3026588,3028797,"I think we can handle anythingthat comes along.","High Noon"
"491",3029923,3034594,"To me that makes sense.To me that's the only way out of this.","High Noon"
"492",3036387,3040601,"Will, I think you better gowhile there's still time.","High Noon"
"493",3042184,3045355,"It's better for you and...it's better for us.","High Noon"
"494",3055739,3057032,"Thanks.","High Noon"
"495",3087393,3089728,"Why don't you put that thing away?","High Noon"
"496",3105117,3108413,"- Bang, bang, bang!- You're dead, Kane.","High Noon"
"497",3146572,3149742,"I just sent the kid to find you.Didn't he come?","High Noon"
"498",3149909,3152536,"He was here.","High Noon"
"499",3154871,3157791,"You've been my friend all my life.You got me this job.","High Noon"
"500",3157958,3160626,"You made them send for me.","High Noon"
"501",3160876,3164172,"Ever since I was a kidI wanted to be like you, Mart.","High Noon"
"502",3164380,3170219,"- You've been a law man all your life.- Yeah, all my life. It's a great life.","High Noon"
"503",3170427,3173389,"You risk your skin catching killers,and the juries turn them loose,","High Noon"
"504",3173556,3176224,"so they can come backand shoot at you again.","High Noon"
"505",3176432,3179143,"If you're honest,you're poor your whole life.","High Noon"
"506",3179353,3183523,"In the end you wind up dying all aloneon some dirty street.","High Noon"
"507",3183690,3188735,"For what?For nothing. For a tin star.","High Noon"
"508",3188945,3193865,"The judge's left town, Harvey's quit,and I'm having trouble getting deputies.","High Noon"
"509",3194074,3197077,"It figures. It's all happened too sudden.","High Noon"
"510",3197369,3201873,"People got to talk themselves intolaw and order before they do anything.","High Noon"
"511",3202164,3207003,"Maybe because down deep they don't care.They just don't care.","High Noon"
"512",3213342,3215802,"What'll I do, Mart?","High Noon"
"513",3217971,3220514,"I was hopin' you wouldn't come back","High Noon"
"514",3220766,3225228,"- You know why I came back- But not to commit suicide.","High Noon"
"515",3225436,3228981,"Sometimes... Sometimesprison changes a man.","High Noon"
"516",3229148,3234027,"Not him. This is all planned,that's why they're all here.","High Noon"
"517",3234235,3236947,"Get out, Will! Get out.","High Noon"
"518",3247831,3250001,"Will you come downto that depot with me?","High Noon"
"519",3250168,3252460,"No.","High Noon"
"520",3253461,3257882,"You know how I feel about you,but I ain't goin' with you.","High Noon"
"521",3258050,3262596,"Seems like a man with busted knucklesdidn't need arthritis, don't it?","High Noon"
"522",3263554,3265472,"No, I couldn't do nothin' for you.","High Noon"
"523",3265764,3270436,"You'd get yourself killedworryin' about me.","High Noon"
"524",3270644,3272813,"It's too one-sided like it is.","High Noon"
"525",3279110,3281697,"- So long, Martin.- So long.","High Noon"
"526",3283239,3287409,"It's all for nothin', Will.It's all for nothin'.","High Noon"

"536",3353596,3356599,"- Why?- It wasn't easy for me to come here.","High Noon"
"537",3356806,3359934,"- Why?- Look, Mrs Ramirez...","High Noon"

"540",3367150,3372237,"I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,I just couldn't reach him.","High Noon"
"541",3372445,3376951,"- And now?- That man downstairs, the clerk..","High Noon"
"542",3377159,3379869,"He said things about you and Will","High Noon"
"543",3380119,3382621,"I've tried to understandwhy he wouldn't go with me,","High Noon"
"544",3382873,3385791,"and it's got to be because of you.","High Noon"
"545",3386418,3389170,"- What do you want from me?- Let him go.","High Noon"
"546",3389336,3391505,"He still has a chance. Let him go.","High Noon"

"559",3439967,3443637,"My brother was 19. I watched him die.","High Noon"
"560",3444387,3449809,"That's when I became a Quaker.I don't care who's right or who's wrong.","High Noon"
"561",3450018,3453896,"There's got to be some better wayfor people to live.","High Noon"
"562",3456065,3459233,"Will knows how I feel about it.","High Noon"
"563",3459443,3463655,"Just a minute. Are you goingto wait for the train downstairs?","High Noon"
"564",3463905,3467282,"- Yes.- Why don't you wait here?","High Noon"
"565",3483005,3486300,"I've got no use for Kane,but he's got guts.","High Noon"

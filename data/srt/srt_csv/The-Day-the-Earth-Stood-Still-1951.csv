"490",2444840,2448945,"There are several thousand questionsI'd like to ask you.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"491",2450134,2454354,"- I'd like to explain something of my mission.- That was my first question.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"492",2454430,2460108,"We know from observation that your planethas discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"493",2460184,2465056,"- And that you're experimenting with rockets.- Yes, that is true.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"494",2465171,2470273,"While you were limited to fighting amongyourselves with primitive tanks and aircraft,","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"495",2470350,2472114,"we were unconcerned.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"496",2472191,2476257,"But soon one of your nationswill apply atomic energy to spaceships.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"497",2476334,2480592,"That will create a threat to thepeace and security of other planets.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"498",2480668,2482970,"That, of course,we cannot tolerate.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"499",2483085,2486346,"What exactly is the natureof your mission, Mr Klaatu?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"500",2486422,2489568,"I came here to warn youthat by threatening danger,","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"501",2489645,2493557,"your planet faces danger,very grave danger.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"502",2493634,2496144,"I'm prepared, however,to offer a solution.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"503",2496145,2498084,"Would you care to be more specific?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"504",2498160,2501805,"What I have to say mustbe said to all concerned.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"505",2501881,2505679,"It is too important to beentrusted to any individual.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"506",2511395,2514962,"I gather that your efforts on theofficial level were not successful.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"507",2515039,2519680,"I come to you as a last resort,and I confess my patience is wearing thin.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"508",2519757,2522496,"Must I take drastic actionin order to get a hearing?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"509",2522497,2524475,"What... what sort ofaction do you mean?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"510",2524552,2529117,"Violent action, since that seems to bethe only thing your people understand.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"511",2529194,2533605,"Levelling New York City perhaps,or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"512",2540932,2544307,"Would you meet with the groupof scientists I'm calling together?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"513",2544384,2546505,"You could explainyour mission to them","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"514",2546506,2549332,"and they, in turn, couldpresent it to their various peoples.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"515",2549448,2551787,"That's why I came to see you.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"516",2551864,2554473,"It is not enough tohave men of science.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"517",2554549,2557695,"We scientists are too oftenignored or misunderstood.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"518",2558347,2562490,"We must get leaders from every field -the finest minds in the world.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"519",2562567,2564561,"I leave that in your hands.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"520",2565942,2568090,"One thing, Mr Klaatu.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"521",2568205,2573154,"Suppose this group should rejectyour proposals. What is the alternative?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"522",2573231,2575762,"I'm afraid there is no alternative.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"523",2575839,2578601,"In such a case,the planet Earth would have to be...","The Day the Earth Stood Still"

"525",2580979,2583319,"Such power exists?","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"526",2583971,2586541,"I assure you, such power exists.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"527",2588498,2591912,"The people who come to the meetingmust be made to realise this.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"528",2591989,2594597,"They must understand what is at stake.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"529",2595978,2598433,"- You mentioned a demonstration of force.- Yes.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"530",2598510,2601962,"- Would one be possible before the meeting?- Yes, of course.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"531",2602039,2606335,"Something to dramatise for them andtheir people the seriousness of the situation.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"

"534",2613585,2616194,"Leave it to me.I'll think of something.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"535",2616500,2619032,"Maybe a little demonstration.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"536",2619914,2622868,"Something dramatic,but not destructive.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"
"537",2624518,2627011,"That's quite aninteresting problem.","The Day the Earth Stood Still"

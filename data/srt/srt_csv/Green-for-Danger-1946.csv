"620",2660324,2663259,"Not the desire to remove that somethingbefore Sister Bates could use it...","Green for Danger"
"621",2663327,2666592,"to incriminate anyone...Dr. Barnes, for instance?","Green for Danger"
"622",2666664,2669258,"- Or Mr. Eden.- That's more like it.","Green for Danger"
"623",2669333,2672063,"You're positively excellingyourself this morning, Barnes.","Green for Danger"
"624",2672136,2675128,"- You're the young lady's fianc�, I believe.- I was.","Green for Danger"
"625",2675205,2679039,"- Do you agree with his use of the past tense?- I couldn't agree more.","Green for Danger"
"626",2680711,2683908,"Ah.Another punctured romance.","Green for Danger"
"627",2683981,2688008,"Well, it comes to this... all of you had time,yet none of your stories is corroborated.","Green for Danger"
"628",2688085,2690576,"[Chuckles]Perhaps we all did it!","Green for Danger"
"629",2691855,2695347,"I wonder if you realizeexactly the sort of person we're dealing with.","Green for Danger"
"630",2695426,2698452,"Let me tell youhow I think Sister Bates died.","Green for Danger"
"631",2698529,2701464,"She hurried into the operating theatre,unlocked the cupboard...","Green for Danger"
"632",2701532,2703966,"stooped down to get the evidenceshe had hidden there.","Green for Danger"
"633",2704034,2706468,"- What was it?- I don't know... yet.","Green for Danger"
"634",2706537,2708471,"Then she heard something.","Green for Danger"
"635",2708539,2714273,"She turned and saw a figure standing in the dark,masked and gowned and gloved.","Green for Danger"
"636",2714344,2717973,"I imagine she just stayedwhere she was, staring.","Green for Danger"
"637",2718048,2722985,"Then the murderer came slowlyover to her and stabbed her...","Green for Danger"
"638",2723053,2725078,"dressed her in this soiled theatre gown...","Green for Danger"
"639",2725155,2727248,"and stabbed her again.","Green for Danger"
"640",2727324,2730623,"Through it, to make it look as ifshe'd been killed wearing the gown.","Green for Danger"
"641",2730694,2733527,"- But why?- [Cockrill] I don't know that either.","Green for Danger"
"642",2733597,2737624,"But what we do know is thatthe second wound was made after death...","Green for Danger"
"643",2737701,2739692,"and that the murderer was in a hurry.","Green for Danger"
"644",2739770,2742432,"As you see,he tore the gown somewhat.","Green for Danger"
"645",2744475,2746409,"Now, there's one other thing.","Green for Danger"
"646",2746477,2749037,"This bottle of tablets was takenfrom the poison cupboard.","Green for Danger"
"647",2749113,2752446,"Dr. White has checked the contents,and there are four missing.","Green for Danger"
"648",2752516,2756953,"- A lethal dose.- The murderer has them
and will not hesitate to use them.","Green for Danger"
"649",2758522,2761650,"Four of you are in mortal dangerfrom the fifth.","Green for Danger"
"650",2761725,2767061,"Above all, don't trust your neighbor,your roommate, your fianc�...","Green for Danger"
"651",2767131,2769122,"or your friend.","Green for Danger"
"652",2769199,2771895,"He or she may be the murderer.","Green for Danger"
"653",2773070,2775004,"Come instead...","Green for Danger"
"654",2775072,2777006,"to me.","Green for Danger"
"655",2777074,2780635,"Sister Bates died because she knewsomething and was foolish enough to say so.","Green for Danger"
"656",2781645,2784205,"I beg of you...all of you...","Green for Danger"
"657",2785516,2787643,"not to make the same mistake.","Green for Danger"

"666",2818482,2820450,"[Sobbing Continues]","Green for Danger"
"667",2823353,2826982,"- I shouldn't do that again if I were you, Inspector.- Why not?","Green for Danger"
"668",2827057,2829924,"Because Nurse Sansonis on the verge of a nervous breakdown.","Green for Danger"
"669",2829993,2831984,"Actual or assumed?","Green for Danger"
"670",2832062,2834895,"Perhaps you would preferto judge that for yourself.","Green for Danger"
"671",2834965,2838833,"Three months ago her mother was buriedunder the ruins of her house in a raid.","Green for Danger"
"672",2838902,2842668,"The rescue squad dug for her for three daysand then gave it up.","Green for Danger"
"673",2842739,2845401,"Next day she was found, still alive.","Green for Danger"
"674",2845475,2847500,"She died an hour later.","Green for Danger"
"675",2847578,2849978,"Esther was there the whole time.","Green for Danger"
"676",2850047,2852015,"I could scarcely be expectedto know that.","Green for Danger"
"677",2852082,2855017,"So, without bothering to inquire,you scare the life out of her...","Green for Danger"
"678",2855085,2857417,"like any flat-footed copper off the beat.","Green for Danger"
"679",2857487,2861389,"The police force has not a monopolyof fallen arches, Dr. Barnes.","Green for Danger"
"680",2861458,2864018,"Ask any chiropodist.Thank you, Mr. Eden.","Green for Danger"
"681",2864094,2866858,"Before the war you had a housein Heron's Park, I believe.","Green for Danger"
"682",2866930,2869296,"- Yes.- And you had a practice in the district?","Green for Danger"
"683",2869366,2871300,"- I did.- Good.","Green for Danger"
"684",2871368,2875065,"Well, then, Dr. Barnes, would you careto accompany me to the theatre?","Green for Danger"
"685",2886250,2889413,"- You gave Higgins the anesthetic.- What's that got to do with it?","Green for Danger"
"686",2889486,2892011,"That's what I'm hoping to find out.Did you know him?","Green for Danger"
"687",2892089,2894819,"- Only by sight.- Nurse Woods is a remarkable woman.","Green for Danger"
"688",2894892,2896985,"- Absolutely first-class.- Ever live in Heron's Park?","Green for Danger"
"689",2897060,2899654,"Not so far as I know.She used to live the other side of London.","Green for Danger"
"690",2899730,2901664,"- She took up nursing when her sister died.- When?","Green for Danger"
"691",2901732,2904257,"1940, on the Continent.","Green for Danger"
"692",2904334,2906598,"- Funny.- What is?","Green for Danger"
"693",2906670,2910731,"Oh, it's nothing. It's just that Higginsthought he knew her voice. That's all.","Green for Danger"
"694",2910807,2913241,"Indeed.","Green for Danger"
"695",2913310,2915676,"Have you any views on nasal catarrh?","Green for Danger"
"696",2915746,2917714,"Nothing in particular. Why?","Green for Danger"
"697",2917781,2919772,"Just wondering.","Green for Danger"
"698",2919850,2921977,"I often suffer from it in the mornings.","Green for Danger"
"699",2922052,2924486,"[Blows]","Green for Danger"
"700",2924554,2926522,"That's the machine I used.","Green for Danger"
"701",2926590,2928854,"- I see.- They brought Higgins in here.","Green for Danger"
"702",2928926,2931520,"I examined him.He was quite fit. So we went ahead.","Green for Danger"
"703",2931595,2934257,"- In here?- No. I gave it to him in the theatre.","Green for Danger"
"704",2934331,2937562,"- The coup de gr�ce?- The anesthetic.","Green for Danger"
"705",2937634,2940068,"- Is that usual?- Not really. It's up to me.","Green for Danger"
"706",2940137,2943129,"Naturally.In that case, in we go.","Green for Danger"
"707",2948145,2950636,"I gave nitrous oxide at firstto get him under.","Green for Danger"
"708",2950714,2953239,"Oh, yes. The stuff the dentistgives you, hmm?","Green for Danger"
"709",2953317,2955410,"Commonly known as laughing gas?","Green for Danger"
"710",2955485,2957953,"Used to be. Actually, the impuritiescaused the laughs.","Green for Danger"
"711",2958021,2960888,"Oh. Just the same as our music halls.","Green for Danger"
"712",2961925,2964359,"Then I added oxygen.When he failed to respond...","Green for Danger"
"713",2964428,2968660,"Doctor, my ignorance is simply staggering.Please demonstrate.","Green for Danger"
"714",2968732,2971223,"Black and white, oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"715",2971301,2973235,"Black, nitrous oxide.","Green for Danger"
"716",2973303,2975601,"Green, carbon dioxide.","Green for Danger"
"717",2975672,2978038,"The rest are spares.","Green for Danger"
"718",2978108,2980235,"I began the nitrous oxide.","Green for Danger"
"719",2983213,2985340,"So.","Green for Danger"
"720",2985415,2987713,"The flowmeter registered correctly.","Green for Danger"
"721",2987784,2990252,"- [Gas Hissing]- When I got him under, I added oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"722",2990320,2992811,"Like this.","Green for Danger"
"723",2992889,2997349,"I didn't like the look of him, so I cut downthe nitrous oxide and increased the oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"724",2997427,2999452,"To my surprise, he didn't respond.","Green for Danger"
"725",2999529,3003795,"So I turned off the nitrous oxide altogether,put him on pure oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"726",3003867,3006392,"- And then?- He simply collapsed.","Green for Danger"
"727",3007738,3011435,"I injected adrenaline, and Nurse Woodsgave Coramine as a last resort.","Green for Danger"
"728",3011508,3013442,"Nurse Woods. Hmm.","Green for Danger"
"729",3013510,3016070,"- Could these have been tampered with?- I don't see how.","Green for Danger"
"730",3016146,3018637,"In any event, the damagehad been done before then.","Green for Danger"
"731",3019649,3022277,"- What about this fellow?- Carbon dioxide?","Green for Danger"
"732",3022352,3025344,"- Mmm.- We sometimes use a little to stimulate respiration.","Green for Danger"
"733",3025422,3029017,"- Isn't it poisonous?- Without oxygen, yes.","Green for Danger"
"734",3029092,3031754,"- Use any in Higgins?- None at all.","Green for Danger"
"735",3031828,3034888,"You couldn't have coupled upthe wrong cylinder by mistake?","Green for Danger"
"736",3034965,3037490,"These machines are as foolproofas they can make them.","Green for Danger"
"737",3037567,3040035,"Besides, we checked everything.","Green for Danger"
"738",3040103,3044437,"It wouldn't be possible to fill, say,an empty oxygen cylinder with carbon dioxide?","Green for Danger"
"739",3044508,3047841,"- Good heavens, no. It takes terrific pressure.- Just supposing.","Green for Danger"
"740",3047911,3051005,"Well, the patient would be gettingcarbon dioxide instead of oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"741",3051081,3054482,"He'd die of, well, lack of oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"742",3054551,3058009,"And you couldn't tell by the flowmeteror the postmortem?","Green for Danger"
"743",3058088,3060989,"No. But the whole thing's quite ludicrous.","Green for Danger"
"744",3061058,3063049,"You must bear with me, Doctor.","Green for Danger"
"745",3063126,3065890,"I'm a child in these matters.","Green for Danger"
"746",3065962,3069762,"- Can I go now?- No. I don't think so.","Green for Danger"
"747",3069833,3072097,"You had a similar experienceonce before, didn't you?","Green for Danger"
"748",3072169,3075229,"- I suppose Dr. White's been talking.- Incessantly.","Green for Danger"
"749",3075305,3077569,"It wasn't similar.It was no comparison.","Green for Danger"
"750",3077641,3080303,"- And I made no mistake in either case.- Splendid.","Green for Danger"
"751",3080377,3083471,"- Does Eden think that?- Eden? What's he been saying?","Green for Danger"
"752",3083547,3086675,"Nothing to me.You don't like him, do you?","Green for Danger"
"753",3086750,3089310,"If I discuss that with anybody,it'll be with Eden.","Green for Danger"
"754",3089386,3091320,"Why not?","Green for Danger"
"755",3091388,3094357,"Confidentially,do you think he did it?","Green for Danger"
"756",3095425,3097950,"How should I know?","Green for Danger"
"757",3098028,3099996,"Dr. Barnes.","Green for Danger"
"758",3101898,3103889,"About that anonymous letter.","Green for Danger"
"759",3103967,3107164,"If you're silly enough to attachany importance to a thing like that...","Green for Danger"
"760",3107237,3109228,"Oh, it wasn't that exactly.","Green for Danger"
"761",3109306,3112332,"I was merely wondering if Higginswas the postman who delivered it.","Green for Danger"
"762",3119416,3122544,"[Cockrill Narrating]Yes, I was idiotically pleased with myself at the time.","Green for Danger"
"763",3122619,3124985,"But I am not so pleasedto think of it now...","Green for Danger"
"764",3125055,3127819,"because there was the vital evidence...","Green for Danger"
"765",3127891,3130018,"the clue to the whole business...","Green for Danger"
"766",3130093,3132561,"right under my nose.","Green for Danger"
"767",3133730,3136722,"If I had know then,it might have saved another life.","Green for Danger"
"768",3141304,3145707,"The next morning my presencelay over the hospital like a pall.","Green for Danger"
"769",3146776,3149768,"As I approached, voices were hushed...","Green for Danger"
"770",3149846,3153145,"and all eyes turned upon me.","Green for Danger"
"771",3153216,3155741,"Who was the guilty one?","Green for Danger"
"772",3155819,3158617,"When will he be arrested?","Green for Danger"
"773",3158688,3161589,"Who will be next?[Chuckles]","Green for Danger"
"774",3161658,3163626,"That is what they were thinking.","Green for Danger"
"775",3163693,3167288,"I found it all tremendously enjoyable.","Green for Danger"
"776",3171268,3174237,"During the rest of that dayI continued my investigations...","Green for Danger"
"777",3174304,3176534,"with my accustomed energy.","Green for Danger"
"778",3183413,3185813,"Good afternoon, ladies.[Chuckles]","Green for Danger"
"779",3185882,3188715,"No need to be alarmed.We were only searching your rooms.","Green for Danger"
"780",3191221,3193212,"Well, I'll be...","Green for Danger"
"781",3198662,3202063,"- Did you know Higgins?- Personally, no.","Green for Danger"
"782",3202132,3205465,"What precisely was your relationshipwith Sister Bates?","Green for Danger"
"783",3205535,3207469,"Not exactly distant, I take it.","Green for Danger"
"784",3207537,3210165,"Harmless enough...or so I thought.","Green for Danger"
"785",3210240,3213038,"Nevertheless, you certainlyhad a motive for getting rid of her.","Green for Danger"
"786",3213109,3215077,"Only in her imagination.","Green for Danger"
"787",3215145,3218808,"She might have proved troublesome.She was jealous and possessive.","Green for Danger"
"788",3218882,3221851,"Most women are if you give themthe slightest encouragement.","Green for Danger"
"789",3221918,3223943,"Which you invariably give them. Hmm?","Green for Danger"
"790",3224020,3226284,"[Chuckles]Only sometimes not so slight.","Green for Danger"
"791",3227357,3232226,"- Are you trying to make me lose my temper?- That was only a secondary object.","Green for Danger"
"792",3234664,3238896,"[Cockrill Narrating] From time to time,one of those infernal devices roared overhead.","Green for Danger"

"796",3254918,3259878,"But such trifles, of course, did notfor a moment distract me from my purpose.","Green for Danger"
"797",3261825,3264794,"Did Higgins say anything that nightthat you think might help us?","Green for Danger"
"798",3264861,3267989,"- He'd only just got in when the bomb fell.- He didn't speak again?","Green for Danger"
"799",3268064,3272228,"No. 'Cause I went clean out for a bit.When I came round, all I could hear was the radio.","Green for Danger"
"800",3272302,3274236,"Hmm? The radio?","Green for Danger"
"801",3274304,3277740,"Yes. Our old wireless set.Still hollering a treat it was too.","Green for Danger"
"802",3277807,3279775,"- Ah. What was it playing?- Wasn't playing.","Green for Danger"
"803",3279843,3281777,"- Hmm?- It was talking.","Green for Danger"
"804",3281845,3285906,"- What about?- Well, uh, let me think.","Green for Danger"
"805",3286916,3290408,"Come along now.Surely you can remember.","Green for Danger"
"806",3293823,3297782,"I can't get it out of my mind. When I woke uptoday I didn't remember at first.","Green for Danger"
"807",3297861,3302992,"Then it all came back. I went to the window,and there was the inspector slinking about outside.","Green for Danger"
"808",3303066,3305967,"He's probably lurking aboutin the bushes at this very moment.","Green for Danger"
"809",3306036,3308732,"- Oughtn't we go back?- Why?","Green for Danger"
"810",3309806,3312969,"- It's a lovely night.- We're still suspects.","Green for Danger"
"811",3313043,3315068,"That's a very good thoughtto escape from.","Green for Danger"
"812",3315145,3317136,"It's not easy.","Green for Danger"
"813",3319916,3323647,"- Have you seen Barney?- No.","Green for Danger"
"814",3323720,3326086,"I don't know what to do about him.","Green for Danger"
"815",3326156,3329057,"Isn't it time you made up your mind?","Green for Danger"
"816",3329125,3332094,"He's behaving so ridiculously.","Green for Danger"
"817",3332162,3335325,"I don't blame him.He's in love with you.","Green for Danger"
"818",3335398,3337889,"I don't blame him for that either.","Green for Danger"

"1031",4214910,4217777,"Why don't you tell them?Why don't you tell them I did it?","Green for Danger"
"1032",4217846,4219746,"Now, who on earth said you did?","Green for Danger"
"1033",4219815,4221806,"Or didn't.","Green for Danger"
"1034",4225387,4228379,"- Leave her.- [Woods Sobbing]","Green for Danger"
"1035",4228457,4232894,"The inspector has a charming aptitudefor traveling in ever decreasing circles...","Green for Danger"
"1036",4232962,4235692,"which I fear can only have one end.","Green for Danger"
"1037",4237199,4240498,"Someday, Mr. Eden,I must try my hand at removing an appendix.","Green for Danger"
"1038",4240569,4242503,"I fancy the progress will be slow...","Green for Danger"
"1039",4242571,4245438,"until I discover what Nurse Linleywas going to say about that gown.","Green for Danger"
"1040",4245507,4248408,"[Barnes]She'll tell you that when she comes round.","Green for Danger"
"1041",4248477,4250945,"Dr. Barnes, she may never come round.","Green for Danger"
"1042",4251013,4253538,"- What do you mean?- Her skull was fractured in her fall.","Green for Danger"
"1043",4253616,4255208,"- [Eden] What?- Come back.","Green for Danger"
"1044",4255284,4257218,"- I must see her.- I said come back.","Green for Danger"
"1045",4257286,4259220,"- Why?- It can't do any good.","Green for Danger"
"1046",4259288,4261222,"- And I can't trust you.- Yes, but...","Green for Danger"
"1047",4261290,4263815,"Besides, I haven't finished.There is pressure on her brain...","Green for Danger"
"1048",4263892,4266224,"which I am told can only be relievedby an operation...","Green for Danger"
"1049",4266295,4268388,"if she's to liveand tell me what she knows.","Green for Danger"
"1050",4268464,4270489,"- What? Trephining?- [Cockrill] So Mr. Purdy says.","Green for Danger"
"1051",4270566,4274525,"- That's very serious.- The operation will take place
at 9:30 tomorrow morning.","Green for Danger"
"1052",4274603,4278664,"All of you will undertake exactly the sameduties as you did in the case of Higgins.","Green for Danger"
"1053",4278741,4280709,"What? You can't do that.","Green for Danger"
"1054",4280776,4284268,"- You prefer not to give the anesthetic?- I prefer not to see her killed.","Green for Danger"
"1055",4284346,4286746,"The one doesn't necessarily followfrom the other.","Green for Danger"
"1056",4286815,4288783,"Even if it did in the case of Higgins.","Green for Danger"
"1057",4288851,4291877,"Nurse Woods, do you remember accuratelyall that you did before?","Green for Danger"
"1058",4291954,4295185,"- Yes. I think so.- You're willing to do the same again?","Green for Danger"
"1059",4296191,4298682,"- All right.- Thank you. Nurse Sanson.","Green for Danger"
"1060",4299895,4303888,"How about you? Are you willing to performprecisely the same duties as you did before?","Green for Danger"
"1061",4305267,4307292,"Yes. I suppose so.","Green for Danger"
"1062",4307369,4310861,"May I point out that you can't exactly reproducethe circumstances of Higgins's death...","Green for Danger"
"1063",4310939,4312907,"which I presume is what you're after.","Green for Danger"
"1064",4312975,4315944,"- Oh? Why not?- Because I shan't be operating.","Green for Danger"
"1065",4316011,4319071,"If you refuse,I can only draw one conclusion.","Green for Danger"
"1066",4319148,4321173,"In this case, the wrong one.","Green for Danger"
"1067",4321250,4324151,"You see,I don't happen to be a brain surgeon.","Green for Danger"
"1068",4324219,4328986,"Very plausible, Mr. Eden. But if Mr. Purdyoperates, do you object to assisting him?","Green for Danger"
"1069",4329992,4331926,"No.","Green for Danger"
"1070",4331994,4334519,"- [Cockrill] Thank you.- You're not gonna let him touch her.","Green for Danger"
"1071",4334596,4338623,"- [Cockrill] Why not?- May I remind you that Higgins died
before I could operate?","Green for Danger"
"1072",4338701,4343365,"- What are you suggesting?- Only that the chief danger seems to lie
in the giving of the anesthetic.","Green for Danger"
"1073",4343439,4346704,"- You hinted that to Dr. White, didn't you?- I did not. Why should I?","Green for Danger"
"1074",4346775,4349437,"You had something to gainif I had been forced to leave.","Green for Danger"
"1075",4349511,4351843,"- Did? What?- Freddi.","Green for Danger"
"1076",4351914,4353882,"Now, who on earth gave you that idea?","Green for Danger"
"1077",4353949,4357476,"Sister Bates, if you want to know...just before she was killed.","Green for Danger"
"1078",4357553,4360351,"Just beforeyou met her in the garden.","Green for Danger"
"1079",4360422,4362413,"- Mr. Eden...- Inspector.","Green for Danger"
"1080",4362491,4366450,"Pardon me interrupting, gentlemen,but did you meet Sister Bates in the garden?","Green for Danger"
"1081",4367529,4371021,"- Yes.- And you never told me.","Green for Danger"
"1082",4371100,4374797,"I saw no point in making things more difficultfor myself than they already were.","Green for Danger"
"1083",4374870,4377600,"- Do you expect him to believe that?- He might prefer the truth...","Green for Danger"
"1084",4377673,4379834,"to your jealous suspicions.","Green for Danger"
"1085",4405734,4408703,"Hendricks. Don't interfere.","Green for Danger"
"1086",4415611,4417943,"Well, well, well.","Green for Danger"
"1087",4418013,4421881,"A master of surgerymixing it with an L.R.C.P.","Green for Danger"
"1088",4422951,4425476,"[Chuckles]What a delicious spectacle.","Green for Danger"
"1089",4425554,4429615,"We might arrange a future contest in aid ofsome deserving charity. Don't you think?","Green for Danger"
"1090",4429691,4431625,"[Chuckles]","Green for Danger"
"1091",4431693,4433854,"Perhaps the police orphanage, Inspector.","Green for Danger"
"1092",4433929,4436523,"[Laughing]","Green for Danger"
"1093",4436598,4440694,"Well, I suppose I ought to be glad thatmy suspects haven't been reduced still further.","Green for Danger"
"1094",4440769,4445069,"And I take it we shall all meet tomorrowmorning in the operating theatre at 9:30.","Green for Danger"
"1095",4445140,4447836,"I shall ask Dr. White to makethe necessary arrangements.","Green for Danger"
"1096",4447910,4450504,"It ought to be quite dramatic.","Green for Danger"
"1097",4459822,4462484,"Well? How's Nurse Linley?","Green for Danger"
"1098",4462558,4466426,"- Oh, much better, thank you.- Pulse and temperature back to normal.","Green for Danger"
"1099",4466495,4469828,"Splendid. You've hada very narrow escape, young lady.","Green for Danger"
"1100",4469898,4471957,"- Yes.- Have you told them all?","Green for Danger"
"1101",4472034,4475333,"I have indeed. I have convinced themthat Nurse Linley is at death's door.","Green for Danger"
"1102",4475404,4477338,"They have agreed to cooperate.","Green for Danger"
"1103",4477406,4480102,"Do you seriously intend to go throughwith this fantastic scheme?","Green for Danger"
"1104",4480175,4482109,"- I do indeed.- Well, I suggest that...","Green for Danger"
"1105",4482177,4484168,"Well, Mr. Purdy.Are you word perfect?","Green for Danger"
"1106",4484246,4489309,"Oh, I think so. Depressed fractureof the occiput necessitating craniotomy.","Green for Danger"
"1107",4489384,4492114,"Really? Even to say that'san achievement.","Green for Danger"
"1108",4492187,4495645,"What about Mr. Eden? As your assistant,would he expect to examine Nurse Linley?","Green for Danger"
"1109",4495724,4500161,"Uh, no. Not necessarily. No.I'll show him these X-rays.","Green for Danger"
"1110",4500229,4503255,"Prewar patient of mine.Uh... Oh.","Green for Danger"
"1111",4503332,4505266,"Ah.","Green for Danger"
"1112",4505334,4507359,"- Very nice fracture.- Recover?","Green for Danger"
"1113",4507436,4509370,"- Oh, yes.- Remarkable.","Green for Danger"
"1114",4509438,4511929,"Surely no one in their senseswould make another attempt.","Green for Danger"
"1115",4512007,4513941,"Not in their senses, certainly.","Green for Danger"
"1116",4514009,4517342,"But it must have occurred to you thatwe are dealing with an unbalanced mind.","Green for Danger"
"1117",4517412,4522076,"A one-track mind that can see things onlyone way. In every other aspect as sane as I am.","Green for Danger"
"1118",4522150,4524243,"Or even as you are, Dr. White.","Green for Danger"
"1119",4524319,4528050,"Possibly. You think what happenedbefore will happen again.","Green for Danger"
"1120",4528123,4530057,"I think they'll try.","Green for Danger"
"1121",4530125,4533492,"- Well, I wash my hands of the whole business.- You couldn't do better.","Green for Danger"
"1122",4534630,4536689,"- And, Nurse Linley.- Yes?","Green for Danger"
"1123",4538700,4541430,"I've explained to youthe risk that you'll be running...","Green for Danger"
"1124",4541503,4544267,"but if you wish to change your mind now,I'll quite understand.","Green for Danger"
"1125",4544339,4547069,"No. I've thought it over,and I'll do as you tell me.","Green for Danger"
"1126",4547142,4550441,"Thank you. I'm very grateful.Meanwhile, absolute secrecy.","Green for Danger"
"1127",4550512,4553481,"- I know.- Till tomorrow, is there anything I can do for you?","Green for Danger"
"1128",4553549,4556484,"- Well, could I see someone?- Who? Mr. Eden?","Green for Danger"
"1129",4556552,4560010,"- No. Dr. Barnes.- Dr. Barnes.","Green for Danger"
"1130",4560088,4563455,"Well, his style is less polished,but his footwork is superior.","Green for Danger"
"1131",4563525,4565459,"- Hmm?- [Chuckles] Never mind.","Green for Danger"
"1132",4565527,4568826,"No, my dear. I'm afraid you can't see him.There can be no exceptions.","Green for Danger"
"1133",4568897,4571161,"- Still willing?- Of course.","Green for Danger"
"1134",4571233,4573167,"- Good.- [White] This is absolute lunacy.","Green for Danger"
"1135",4573235,4575999,"I disagree.You see, I think I know who did it.","Green for Danger"
"1136",4577005,4578996,"[Door Opens, Closes]","Green for Danger"
"1137",4602864,4605458,"[White] Twenty past.They'll be bringing her in any minute.","Green for Danger"
"1138",4605534,4608025,"[Cockrill]Dr. Barnes.","Green for Danger"
"1139",4608103,4610628,"Now, is everything laid outexactly as it was before?","Green for Danger"
"1140",4610706,4612640,"[Barnes]All correct.","Green for Danger"
"1141",4612708,4614801,"- [Cockrill] You're quite satisfied?- [Barnes] Yes.","Green for Danger"
"1142",4614876,4618471,"- Right. Take the whole lot back again, Sister.- What? Now, sir?","Green for Danger"
"1143",4618547,4621573,"- Yes. Now.Change every single item with a fresh one.
- What's the idea?","Green for Danger"
"1144",4621650,4623880,"We can't be too careful. Can we?","Green for Danger"
"1145",4628991,4631152,"Oh. Allow me.","Green for Danger"
"1146",4631226,4633786,"- This is indeed an honor, sir.- Nervous?","Green for Danger"
"1147",4633862,4636262,"- Paralytic.- You don't look it.","Green for Danger"
"1148",4636331,4638299,"- Did you do this last time?- Yes.","Green for Danger"
"1149",4638367,4640733,"It's a new oxygen cylinder.","Green for Danger"
"1150",4640802,4643396,"- Do you think anything will happen?- Oh, yes. I think so.","Green for Danger"
"1151",4643472,4645406,"- Well, in that case...- What's this?","Green for Danger"
"1152",4645474,4649137,"- Lubricant for the airway tube.- Change it.","Green for Danger"
"1153",4649211,4651577,"- Where's Eden?- On his way, I hope.","Green for Danger"
"1154",4668530,4670464,"- All right?- [Hendricks] Yes, sir.","Green for Danger"
"1155",4670532,4673126,"Good. Watch her.","Green for Danger"
"1156",4675470,4678268,"- Freddi.- No nearer. Please, Doctor.","Green for Danger"
"1157",4687482,4690542,"[Cockrill]Ah. There you are, Mr. Eden.","Green for Danger"
"1158",4692521,4696389,"We're nearly ready.Nurse Sanson, will you bring in the patient?","Green for Danger"
"1159",4696458,4698449,"Yes, sir.","Green for Danger"
"1160",4700662,4702994,"- Are you ready, Doctor?- [Barnes] Yes.","Green for Danger"
"1161",4703065,4707593,"Oh, Dr. Barnes. I believe I know whyyou gave Higgins the anesthetic on the table.","Green for Danger"
"1162",4707669,4709603,"Why?","Green for Danger"
"1163",4709671,4712003,"Because you wanted witnesses.","Green for Danger"
"1164",4712074,4714065,"Hmm?","Green for Danger"
"1165",4720615,4723106,"[Gas Hissing]","Green for Danger"
"1166",4724252,4726243,"All right.","Green for Danger"
"1167",4729624,4731615,"[Cockrill]Right. Go ahead.","Green for Danger"
"1168",4733161,4735459,"- [White] Nitrous oxide.- [Cockrill] Hmm.","Green for Danger"
"1169",4754049,4756108,"Now for the oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"1170",4758520,4760511,"Oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"1171",4800962,4803157,"[Cockrill]Is she all right?","Green for Danger"
"1172",4803231,4805324,"[White]Her color.","Green for Danger"
"1173",4805400,4807095,"More oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"1174",4815177,4818271,"- She's not responding.- More oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"1175",4828790,4831088,"She's collapsing.","Green for Danger"
"1176",4831159,4833719,"Don't give her any more.","Green for Danger"
"1177",4833795,4836161,"- Cut off the anesthetic.- She's not getting any.","Green for Danger"
"1178",4836231,4838199,"It's pure oxygen.She must have oxygen.","Green for Danger"
"1179",4844806,4847297,"- Cut it off!- I can't.","Green for Danger"
"1180",4847375,4849639,"- Cut off the oxygen!- [Eden] What's the idea?","Green for Danger"
"1181",4849711,4851736,"- [Cockrill] Purdy!- [Purdy] All right. All right.","Green for Danger"
"1182",4851813,4854111,"[Cockrill]Purdy. The spare oxygen. Can you change it?","Green for Danger"
"1183",4854182,4856173,"Yes. Here.","Green for Danger"
"1184",4857619,4859814,"[Hissing]","Green for Danger"
"1185",4859888,4861879,"[Barnes]Right.","Green for Danger"
"1186",4876905,4878896,"She's responding now.","Green for Danger"
"1187",4879975,4881966,"[White]She'll be all right.","Green for Danger"
"1188",4883345,4886746,"- Inspector, I'm completely bewildered.- [Cockrill] Give me a pair of scissors.","Green for Danger"
"1189",4892787,4895415,"[Eden]Green.","Green for Danger"
"1190",4895490,4897424,"Yes.","Green for Danger"
"1191",4897492,4900325,"Green for carbon dioxide.","Green for Danger"
"1192",4900395,4902420,"You've been pumping CO� into her.","Green for Danger"
"1193",4902497,4904727,"- [Barnes] And Higgins?- Precisely.","Green for Danger"
"1194",4904799,4907563,"A green cylinder repaintedblack and white in each case.","Green for Danger"
"1195",4907636,4909695,"- Does that suggest anything to you?- What?","Green for Danger"
"1196",4909771,4913229,"The salvage bins you've been havingrepainted... also in black and white.","Green for Danger"
"1197",4913308,4916004,"- Good heavens!- Mmm. That's where they got the paint.","Green for Danger"
"1198",4916077,4918875,"- [Linley Moaning]- She's coming round.","Green for Danger"
"1199",4918947,4920881,"Freddi.","Green for Danger"
"1200",4920949,4925283,"If I were you, I'd walk her about the theatre fora bit. The poor girl must be feeling the strain.","Green for Danger"
"1201",4925353,4927821,"- What?- With a fractured skull?","Green for Danger"
"1202",4927889,4932121,"It may possibly disappoint you to learn that theyoung lady's cranium is at least as sound as yours.","Green for Danger"
"1203",4937666,4939657,"Hello, Barney.","Green for Danger"
"1204",4939734,4941895,"It's all right. You're safe.","Green for Danger"
"1205",4941970,4944632,"Yes. Her lifeis no longer in any danger.","Green for Danger"
"1206",4944706,4948767,"But of course, she told me yesterdaywhat she was going to say about that gown.","Green for Danger"
"1207",4948843,4950811,"What was it?","Green for Danger"
"1208",4950879,4953404,"She said the holethe knife made was too big.","Green for Danger"
"1209",4953481,4956245,"Almost as if something had been cut out.She was quite right.","Green for Danger"
"1210",4956318,4958252,"- Something had been cut out?- Of course.","Green for Danger"
"1211",4958320,4960584,"But I couldn'tfor the life of me think what.","Green for Danger"
"1212",4960655,4965922,"Until just now, when I noticed this smearof black paint on Nurse Woods's gown.","Green for Danger"
"1213",4965994,4969930,"Nurse Woods, have you any idea what it wasthat Sister Bates had hidden in this theatre?","Green for Danger"
"1214",4969998,4972296,"- No.- It was this.","Green for Danger"
"1215",4972367,4975666,"Thought you might know,because it happens to be your gown.","Green for Danger"
"1216",4975737,4979195,"- Mine?- Mmm. The one you wore last time,
when Higgins died.","Green for Danger"
"1217",4979274,4982607,"And look. Just here...","Green for Danger"
"1218",4982677,4986807,"curiously enough, there used to be anothersmear of black paint from the first cylinder.","Green for Danger"
"1219",4986881,4990749,"- The one that killed Higgins.- [Barnes] And Sister Bates spotted it.","Green for Danger"
"1220",4990819,4992787,"And jumped to the right conclusion.","Green for Danger"
"1221",4993855,4998690,"You see, one thing the murderer couldn't controlwas the time the paint took to dry: About 12 hours.","Green for Danger"
"1222",4998760,5001888,"But why dress Sister Bates up in the thingand stab her again?","Green for Danger"
"1223",5001963,5005524,"To distract attention from the tearwhere the paint had been...","Green for Danger"
"1224",5005600,5008967,"by sticking the knife... through it.","Green for Danger"
"1225",5014142,5016508,"It's all right.","Green for Danger"
"1226",5016578,5018603,"Do you think I could sit down?","Green for Danger"

"1228",5023151,5025915,"Yes. It must have beena terrifying moment for the murderer...","Green for Danger"
"1229",5025987,5029980,"alone here in this theatrewith Sister Bates dead at his feet.","Green for Danger"
"1230",5030058,5032959,"In the moonlight,with the wind screeching outside...","Green for Danger"
"1231",5033028,5036225,"and the window slammingand opening.","Green for Danger"
"1232",5036297,5038492,"Slamming and opening...","Green for Danger"
"1233",5038566,5041399,"with the gown clutchedin the dead woman's hand...","Green for Danger"
"1234",5041469,5043494,"with its telltale streak of paint...","Green for Danger"
"1235",5043571,5045505,"and time pressing...","Green for Danger"
"1236",5045573,5049600,"so that any action was better than noneand first thoughts had to be best.","Green for Danger"
"1237",5049677,5052441,"- Can't you see it?- For heaven's sake, come to the point.","Green for Danger"
"1238",5052514,5054812,"Ah, but that is the point. Time.","Green for Danger"
"1239",5054883,5058114,"Each of you had a motive for killing Higginsafter you'd recognized him...","Green for Danger"
"1240",5058186,5060154,"but which of you had time?","Green for Danger"
"1241",5060221,5062280,"Was there someone you thoughtwould be incriminated...","Green for Danger"
"1242",5062357,5064689,"if Nurse Linley had been allowedto speak yesterday?","Green for Danger"
"1243",5064759,5067353,"- I don't understand you.- I think you do. Who was it?","Green for Danger"
"1244",5067429,5070091,"I don't know. Nobody.","Green for Danger"
"1245",5070165,5073032,"- I can't tell you anything. I don't...- Can't you leave her alone?","Green for Danger"
"1246",5073101,5077868,"- I told you before. She's in no state...- Why, on the day before Higgins's death,
did Mr. Eden urge you to leave this hospital?","Green for Danger"
"1247",5077939,5079429,"I don't know.","Green for Danger"
"1248",5079507,5084308,"Because this was the worst possible place for her.I've explained that before.","Green for Danger"
"1249",5084379,5089442,"I warn you. She's in no condition to be questioned,and you can place no reliance on her answers.","Green for Danger"
"1250",5089517,5093214,"Oh, can't I, Mr. Eden?That's most illuminating.","Green for Danger"
"1251",5093288,5096724,"What time did you leave the ward afterexamining Higgins the night before he died?","Green for Danger"
"1252",5096791,5099089,"- What's that got to do with it?- Answer my question.","Green for Danger"
"1253",5099160,5101094,"- About 10:30.- Where did you go?","Green for Danger"
"1254",5101162,5103494,"- Back to my room.- Did you pass the paint store on the way?","Green for Danger"
"1255",5103565,5105499,"Probably.","Green for Danger"
"1256",5105567,5108559,"What became of those tabletsthat were taken from the poison cupboard?","Green for Danger"
"1257",5108636,5110797,"How should I know?","Green for Danger"
"1258",5110872,5114205,"- Nurse Linley, do you feel well enough to talk?- Yes.","Green for Danger"
"1259",5114275,5117540,"- If I can help.- Now please think very carefully.","Green for Danger"
"1260",5117612,5121708,"What time did you go on dutyon the night before Higgins died?","Green for Danger"
"1261",5121783,5124081,"I was a bit late.About five past 10:00.","Green for Danger"
"1262",5124152,5127280,"Whereupon, presumably,Nurse Sanson left.","Green for Danger"
"1263",5127355,5130324,"- Yes. As soon as I got there.- Say about 10:10.","Green for Danger"
"1264",5130391,5132882,"What time did Nurse Sansonreach your quarters?","Green for Danger"
"1265",5132961,5134895,"It was late, wasn't it?","Green for Danger"
"1266",5134963,5137955,"- Yes. She said Freddi had overslept.- What time was it?","Green for Danger"

"1268",5141035,5145028,"Thank you. It should have taken youfive minutes, yet it took you nearly 40. Why?","Green for Danger"
"1269",5145106,5149372,"- I don't know. I didn't feel very well.- Did you pass the paint store?","Green for Danger"
"1270",5151779,5153713,"[Sanson]Yes. I suppose I did.","Green for Danger"
"1271",5153781,5157444,"[Cockrill] Did you see anyone or anythingin there that made you pause or stop?","Green for Danger"
"1272",5157519,5159544,"- [Sanson] I can't remember.- Try. Was the door open?","Green for Danger"
"1273",5159621,5162146,"- It may have been.- Was there a light on inside?","Green for Danger"
"1274",5162223,5165886,"- I don't know. I can't remember.- Did you see anyone or anything in there?","Green for Danger"
"1275",5167629,5169620,"[Shouts]Did you?","Green for Danger"
"1276",5171466,5175368,"- Or were you there alone?- Can't you see she's had enough?","Green for Danger"
"1277",5175436,5178166,"I've warned you, Inspector.","Green for Danger"
"1278",5178239,5182232,"Mr. Eden, why do you keep on interrupting?Are you afraid of something she might say?","Green for Danger"
"1279",5182310,5185541,"- I've given you my reasons.- [Cockrill] This time I'd like the truth.","Green for Danger"
"1280",5186714,5190411,"- May I speak to her alone?- No! Are you going to answer me, Mr. Eden?","Green for Danger"
"1281",5191953,5194217,"[Cockrill]Stop him!","Green for Danger"

"1285",5203064,5205055,"Look out!","Green for Danger"
"1286",5215777,5217768,"[White]Eden!","Green for Danger"
"1287",5219981,5223678,"Esther Sanson, I arrest you for the willful murderof Joseph Higgins and Marion Bates...","Green for Danger"
"1288",5223751,5225742,"and for the attempted murderof Frederica Linley.","Green for Danger"
"1289",5225820,5228914,"I must warn you that anything you saymay be used in evidence.","Green for Danger"
"1290",5228990,5230582,"- Esther.- What?","Green for Danger"
"1291",5230658,5232990,"- It can't be.- [Cockrill] It is.","Green for Danger"
"1292",5233061,5235757,"- Eden.- It's not true. How could it be?","Green for Danger"
"1293",5235830,5239891,"- She got me out of my room when the gas...- Oh, yes. She intended to make a dramatic rescue.","Green for Danger"
"1294",5239968,5242562,"Just too late.But she arrived back a bit too early.","Green for Danger"
"1295",5242637,5245606,"Then she saw me approaching,smashed the window and dragged you out.","Green for Danger"
"1296",5245673,5249666,"- And saved my life.- And contrived to let you fall
headlong down the stairs.","Green for Danger"
"1297",5249744,5252076,"By that time she had to be contentwith second best.","Green for Danger"
"1298",5252146,5254205,"Esther. You didn't do it, did you?","Green for Danger"
"1299",5254282,5257342,"I did.You knew, didn't you?","Green for Danger"
"1300",5257418,5260649,"I was almost certain,but I didn't know how.","Green for Danger"
"1301",5260722,5264351,"[Barnes] But why should she want tokill Higgins? What had he done?","Green for Danger"
"1302",5264425,5268691,"- Tell them.- Higgins was head of the rescue squad
that left her mother to die.","Green for Danger"
"1303",5268763,5270958,"- [Woods] What?- That was how it seemed to her.","Green for Danger"
"1304",5271032,5273523,"They had no choice,but she couldn't see it that way.","Green for Danger"
"1305",5273601,5275592,"She transferredher obsession of guilt to Higgins...","Green for Danger"
"1306",5275670,5278298,"the blame she attached to herselffor leaving her mother alone.","Green for Danger"
"1307",5278373,5281274,"By punishing him,she was relieving herself.","Green for Danger"
"1308",5282510,5284774,"I don't understand that.","Green for Danger"
"1309",5284846,5288213,"I was quite right, of course.Could I have a drink of water, please?","Green for Danger"
"1310",5288283,5290843,"- Purdy.- But Freddi and Sister Bates.","Green for Danger"
"1311",5290918,5293250,"Yes. That was bad.But I couldn't let them talk...","Green for Danger"
"1312",5293321,5296882,"otherwise I should have been found outand punished for something that was right.","Green for Danger"
"1313",5296958,5300018,"- Esther, I'm sorry.- You understand, don't you?","Green for Danger"
"1314",5301396,5303387,"Water, quick. She's fainted.","Green for Danger"
"1315",5304932,5307093,"She's dead.","Green for Danger"
"1316",5307168,5309398,"What?","Green for Danger"
"1317",5309470,5312928,"She can't be dead.She can't be dead.","Green for Danger"
"1318",5313007,5315202,"- Can't you do something?- It's too late.","Green for Danger"
"1319",5317045,5320572,"- Mr. Eden, you have deliberatelyconnived in her death.
- Have I? How?","Green for Danger"
"1320",5320648,5323242,"You followed her in herewith that hypodermic.","Green for Danger"
"1321",5323318,5327550,"- Quite true.- There is a penalty for helping a criminal
to evade the consequences.","Green for Danger"
"1322",5327622,5331683,"Aren't you being a little rash?You don't know yet how she died.","Green for Danger"
"1323",5331759,5334227,"- Well?- Have you forgotten those tablets?","Green for Danger"
"1324",5334295,5337264,"I have not.And neither, I imagine, did you forget them.","Green for Danger"
"1325",5337332,5339732,"They killed Esther.","Green for Danger"
"1326",5340802,5342736,"A lethal dose self-administered.","Green for Danger"
"1327",5342804,5346296,"- Self? Then what...- When I realized it must be Esther...","Green for Danger"
"1328",5346374,5349605,"I knew she was definitely insaneand that she had the tablets.","Green for Danger"
"1329",5349677,5354376,"I wanted to be ready, but you came over to me,and I was too late to stop her.","Green for Danger"
"1330",5356017,5359180,"Yes, Inspector.That was the antidote.","Green for Danger"
"1331",5359253,5361244,"Antidote?","Green for Danger"
"1332",5361322,5364621,"- Then wha...- And you knocked it out of my hand.","Green for Danger"

"1336",5386013,5391041,"In fact, it still seems to methat I fell down rather badly on the case.","Green for Danger"

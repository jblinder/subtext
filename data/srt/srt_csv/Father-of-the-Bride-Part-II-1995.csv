as it goes with MacKenzie.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"360",1453874,1457419,"Uh, wait a minute. I thought thebaby's last name was gonna be
Banks-MacKenzie with a hyphen.","Father of the Bride Part II"

"364",1463049,1465468,"It's an awfully longlast name, George.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"365",1465468,1468388,"Hold on. What are we saying?You're not gonna hyphenate the
last name? When did this happen?","Father of the Bride Part II"

"368",1473517,1475811,"And since neither of uswant to forfeit our names,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"369",1475936,1478772,"we've been coming upwith alternative last names.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"370",1478897,1481817,"Your baby's gonna have an alternativelast name? Like, what, Smith or Jones?","Father of the Bride Part II"

make Smith or Jones from
the letters of our last names.","Father of the Bride Part II"

"376",1496205,1499458,"- Yeah.- Look, look. I have
a simple solution here.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"377",1499583,1503378,"George, Nina. You already haveMatty to carry on the family name.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"378",1503420,1507215,"So, why don't we drop thisBanks-MacKenzie business and...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"379",1507298,1509842,"just go with MacKenzie?","Father of the Bride Part II"
"380",1509884,1513888,"- Or drop the MacKenzie.- Oh, well, now wouldn't that be silly?","Father of the Bride Part II"
"381",1514013,1516307,"Well, I don't think that's anysillier than dropping the Banks.","Father of the Bride Part II"

"850",3371215,3373467,"Still tryingto redeem myself,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"851",3373551,3375970,"I did the unthinkable.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"852",3376011,3379765,"I hired Franck to surprise the girlswith a double baby shower.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"853",3381349,3384853,"- It's a baby shower! Oh!- Hello, ladies.","Father of the Bride Part II"

"860",3407790,3410168,"and Franck started givingdecorating tips.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"861",3410251,3412336,"But this is what I suggest.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"862",3412461,3414380,"Firstly, if it were me,you know,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"863",3414421,3419009,"what I would do is I'dpush those windows out and let
sweet San Marino light fill in.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"864",3421803,3424139,"Therefore, the third trimesterin the Banks family began...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"865",3424222,3428226,"with a remodel of what wenow affectionately called
''the baby's suite.''","Father of the Bride Part II"
"866",3431020,3434398,"I'll admit we got a little carried away,and it wasn't even all Franck's fault,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"867",3434523,3437067,"although God knowsI tried to blame him.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"868",3437192,3438777,"- Hey! Hey!- No, no, no, no!","Father of the Bride Part II"
"869",3438902,3441029,"Nina and Annie were doing great,right on schedule...","Father of the Bride Part II"

"871",3445617,3447368,"Ohh! Oh.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"872",3448911,3451080,"We had everything you'd expectwhen you're expecting:","Father of the Bride Part II"
"873",3451122,3453833,"leg cramps, backachesand cravings.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"874",3453874,3456251,"And the women were worse.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"875",3462382,3464301,"What we didn't expectone sleepy night...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"876",3464426,3467011,"was an unexpected visitor.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"877",3472933,3475603,"- Oh, hi, Dad.- You okay?","Father of the Bride Part II"
"878",3477104,3479356,"I'm fine.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"879",3479481,3481608,"Bryan and I got in a fight.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"880",3481691,3486321,"And I got angry and got in my car.I didn't know where to go.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"881",3486488,3489323,"- Did I wake Mom?- No, no, no. She's asleep.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"882",3499958,3501877,"So, do you wanna, you know--","Father of the Bride Part II"
"883",3502043,3504587,"Yeah, sure, I can talk about it.It's not, you know-- It's fine.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"884",3504629,3508216,"- 'Ca-- If you don't wanna, it's okay,'cause I could just make up the sofa.
- No, no, that's-- it's okay.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"885",3508341,3510218,"Thanks.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"886",3513429,3515764,"- Pretzel?- No, thanks.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"887",3521853,3524272,"All right.Here's what happened.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"888",3524439,3528276,"When I was leaving work today,my boss calls me in, tells me
what a great job I'm doing...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"889",3528401,3532655,"and says I have as much promiseas anyone she's hired
since she's been at the firm.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"890",3532822,3535824,"Then she said the great part. She saidthat she's been asked to select...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"891",3535950,3538410,"one person from my levelto be part of a design team...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"892",3538494,3542247,"that's gonna design the newBoston Museum of Contemporary
Art, and she picked me.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"893",3542330,3545291,"- That's fantastic.- I know. I was completely thrilled.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"894",3545417,3548002,"Plus, to live in Boston.I love Boston.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"895",3548127,3551130,"- You have to, uh--- Move to Boston. Yeah.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"896",3551214,3554175,"I need to be there right afterthe baby's born, by October.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"897",3554341,3556677,"- Uh-huh.- I knew when they hired me...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"898",3556802,3559304,"that this was a possibilityone day, and Bryan knew it too.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"899",3559429,3564601,"But now, well-- I rush hometo tell him the news, and as soon as
I say the word ''Boston,'' his face drops.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"900",3564642,3569188,"I mean, this is the kind of opportunityeverybody dreams about, and we're
talking Massachusetts here, not Mars.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"901",3571607,3575402,"So Bryan doesn't wanna go?","Father of the Bride Part II"
"902",3575527,3579323,"Well, he said that he understoodthat career-wise it was great for me,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"903",3579448,3583076,"but with the baby coming,he figured I wouldn't wanna go.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"904",3583243,3585995,"- Which is--- Ridiculous.
- Right.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"905",3586037,3590041,"It's like under that mellow,'90s Gap ad exterior of his...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"906",3590166,3595045,"beats the heart of a 1950shusband that just expects me to
take a backseat to his career.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"907",3595087,3598799,"- You said that to him?- Of course.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"908",3598924,3603386,"To which he said I was nuts,and that all he meant was that
with us having a new baby,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"909",3603470,3607557,"it just seemed like a crazy timeto move to sub-zero weather
and a city full of strangers,","Father of the Bride Part II"
"910",3607682,3609725,"and that I should thinkof you guys...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"911",3609892,3614939,"and of his parents, and how moving sofar away would be so hard on everyone.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"912",3615022,3619526,"Anyway, I knew if anybody wouldunderstand how I felt, it would be you.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"913",3619651,3624197,"You were the one that always told meto go for my dreams, never to settle.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"914",3624280,3626908,"Dad, tell me.Am I being unreasonable to want to go?","Father of the Bride Part II"
"915",3626950,3630703,"Because if you think I am,I won't go. I won't.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"916",3637251,3640545,"Ann, you have to go.This is not the Dark Ages.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"917",3640712,3643923,"We'll still see each other all the time.You'll just be an airplane ride away.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"918",3644090,3645925,"That's exactlywhat I said.","Father of the Bride Part II"
"919",3646009,3648136,"And wasn't Bryan the onewho said you were a gifted architect...","Father of the Bride Part II"
"920",3648261,3650138,"- and he'd move anywhere you got a job?- Yes.","Father of the Bride Part II"

"277",1016353,1018563,"I'm not a type of cuntthat goes looking for bother.","Trainspotting"

"279",1021400,1024861,"and he can get the fire endin his puss anytime he wanted.","Trainspotting"
"280",1024945,1027989,"So I squares up, casual like.","Trainspotting"
"281",1028115,1032035,"What does the hard cunt do?Or the so-called hard cunt?","Trainspotting"
"282",1032119,1033370,"Shites it.","Trainspotting"

"284",1037457,1041628,"And after that,well, the game was mine.","Trainspotting"
"285",1045841,1047217,"And that was it.","Trainspotting"
"286",1047300,1049094,"That was Begbie's story.","Trainspotting"
"287",1049219,1051596,"At least that was Begbie'sversion of the story.","Trainspotting"
"288",1051680,1054641,"But a couple of days laterI got the truth from Tommy.","Trainspotting"
"289",1054766,1056560,"You always got the truthfrom Tommy.","Trainspotting"
"290",1056643,1058437,"It was one ofhis major weaknesses.","Trainspotting"
"291",1058520,1060605,"He never told lies,he never took drugs,","Trainspotting"
"292",1060731,1062649,"and he never cheatedon anyone.","Trainspotting"
"293",1063400,1064776,"It was Wednesday morning.","Trainspotting"
"294",1064901,1066820,"We were in the volleyplaying pool.","Trainspotting"
"295",1066903,1068321,"That much is true.","Trainspotting"
"296",1068405,1072534,"But Begbie is playingabsolutely fucking gash.","Trainspotting"
"297",1072659,1075328,"He's got a hangover so badhe can hardly hold the cue,","Trainspotting"
"298",1075454,1076913,"never mind pot a ball.","Trainspotting"
"299",1076997,1078999,"I'm doing my best to lose,you know.","Trainspotting"
"300",1079124,1081877,"Trying to humor him, like,but it's not doing any good.","Trainspotting"
"301",1082002,1084588,"Every time I touch a ball,I seem to pot something.","Trainspotting"
"302",1084671,1087424,"Every time Begbie goes nearthe table, he fucks it up.","Trainspotting"
"303",1087507,1090010,"Oh, fuck's sake.","Trainspotting"
"304",1091136,1094097,"So he's got the hump, right?","Trainspotting"
"305",1094181,1097559,"But finally I manage to set itup so all he has to do","Trainspotting"
"306",1097684,1099686,"is to pot the blackto win one game","Trainspotting"
"307",1099811,1101480,"to salvage a little bit of pride","Trainspotting"
"308",1101563,1104149,"and maybe not kickmy head in, right?","Trainspotting"
"309",1104274,1108320,"So he's on the black,pressure shot.","Trainspotting"
"310",1110739,1113325,"And it all goes wrong, big-time.","Trainspotting"
"311",1115202,1116203,"Fuck!","Trainspotting"
"312",1116870,1117996,"Aah!","Trainspotting"
"313",1118580,1120874,"He picks on this speckywee gadgee at the bar","Trainspotting"
"314",1120999,1123335,"and accuses him of putting himoff by looking at him.","Trainspotting"
"315",1123418,1124377,"Can you believe it?","Trainspotting"
"316",1124503,1126338,"The cunt hasn't glancedin our direction.","Trainspotting"
"317",1126463,1127547,"Fuck off!","Trainspotting"
"318",1127672,1129925,"He was going to chib him,I tell you.","Trainspotting"
"319",1130050,1132427,"Then I thoughthe was going to do me.","Trainspotting"
"320",1135222,1137974,"The beggar'sfucking psycho, man.","Trainspotting"
"321",1138975,1142687,"But he's a mate, you know,so what can you do?","Trainspotting"
"322",1142771,1144481,"Can I borrow this?","Trainspotting"
"323",1144564,1146691,"What indeed could one do?","Trainspotting"
"324",1146775,1149486,"Just stand back and watchand try not to get involved.","Trainspotting"
"325",1151363,1154282,"Begbie didn't do drugs, either.He just did people.","Trainspotting"
"326",1154408,1158203,"That's what he got off on.His own sensory addiction.","Trainspotting"
"327",1160414,1162416,"Nobody move!","Trainspotting"
"328",1163750,1165001,"That lassie got glassed,","Trainspotting"
"329",1165085,1168255,"and no cunt leaves here tillwe find out what cunt did it.","Trainspotting"
"330",1168380,1169881,"Who the fuck are you?","Trainspotting"

"568",4388175,4389467,"And why is that?","Dirty Harry"

"570",4392930,4395181,"on a trial we can't possibly win.","Dirty Harry"
"571",4395641,4398142,"The problem is, we don't have any evidence.","Dirty Harry"

"573",4401814,4402980,"Zero.","Dirty Harry"
"574",4404441,4408194,"Are you trying to tell me Ballisticscan't match the bullet up to this rifle?","Dirty Harry"
"575",4408487,4411489,"It does not matter what Ballistics can do.","Dirty Harry"
"576",4411907,4414784,"This rifle might make a nice souvenir.","Dirty Harry"
"577",4415828,4418454,"- But it's inadmissible as evidence.- Who says that?","Dirty Harry"
"578",4418664,4419831,"It's the law.","Dirty Harry"
"579",4420499,4422041,"Well, then the law is crazy.","Dirty Harry"
"580",4423168,4426045,"This is Judge Bannermanof the appellate court.","Dirty Harry"
"581",4426296,4431175,"He also holds classes in constitutional lawat Berkeley. I've asked him for an opinion.","Dirty Harry"
"582",4431427,4432510,"Your Honor?","Dirty Harry"
"583",4433679,4438641,"Well, in my opinion, the search of the suspect's quarters was illegal.","Dirty Harry"
"584",4438851,4443020,"Evidence obtained thereby, such as that hunting rifle for instance ...","Dirty Harry"
"585",4443230,4445523,"is inadmissible in court.","Dirty Harry"
"586",4445691,4449360,"You should have gottena search warrant. I'm sorry ...","Dirty Harry"
"587",4449570,4452864,"but it's that simple.- Search warrant? There was a girl dying.","Dirty Harry"
"588",4453073,4456200,"She was, in fact, deadaccording to the medical report.","Dirty Harry"
"589",4456368,4457577,"But I didn't know that.","Dirty Harry"
"590",4458078,4459829,"The court would have to recognize ...","Dirty Harry"
"591",4459997,4463040,"the police officer's legitimate concern for the girl's life ...","Dirty Harry"
"592",4463333,4467503,"but there is no way they canpossibly condone police torture.","Dirty Harry"
"593",4468130,4471757,"All evidence concerning the girl,the suspect's confession ...","Dirty Harry"
"594",4472050,4475845,"all physical evidencewould have to be excluded.","Dirty Harry"
"595",4481727,4483769,"There must be somethingyou can get him on.","Dirty Harry"
"596",4484021,4487023,"Without the evidenceof the gun and the girl?","Dirty Harry"
"597",4487774,4490568,"I couldn't convict himof spitting on the sidewalk.","Dirty Harry"
"598",4492237,4494697,"Now, the suspect's rights ...","Dirty Harry"
"599",4494907,4496741,"were violated ...","Dirty Harry"
"600",4496909,4499118,"under the 4th and 5th ...","Dirty Harry"
"601",4499411,4502205,"and probably the 6thand 14th Amendments.","Dirty Harry"
"602",4502414,4504999,"And Ann Mary Deacon,what about her rights?","Dirty Harry"
"603",4505250,4508377,"I mean, she's raped and left in a hole to die. Who speaks for her?","Dirty Harry"
"604",4508587,4512798,"The district attorney's office.If you'll let us.","Dirty Harry"
"605",4514426,4518596,"I've got a wife and three kids. I don't wanthim on the streets any more than you do.","Dirty Harry"
"606",4518847,4520640,"Well, he won't be out there long.","Dirty Harry"
"607",4520933,4523267,"What is that supposed to mean?","Dirty Harry"
"608",4523435,4526562,"That means sooner or later,he'll stub his toe and I'll be there.","Dirty Harry"
"609",4526772,4529440,"This office won't standfor any harassment.","Dirty Harry"
"610",4530108,4534403,"You're crazy if you think you've heard the last of this guy. He's gonna kill again.","Dirty Harry"
"611",4534780,4536280,"How do you know?","Dirty Harry"

"1113",5804533,5805967,"is the PAK military with him?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1114",5806734,5809134,"the question isn't ""are thePAKs protecting Bin Laden?""","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1115",5809434,5812100,"the question is ""would he allowhimself to be protected by the PAKs?""","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1116",5812701,5813900,"I mean, why would he trust them?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1117",5814100,5815132,"They tried to kil Musharraf","Zero Dark Thirty"

"1127",5850900,5853368,"there's even a 7 foot privacy wall here, so","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1128",5853766,5855966,"even if we got up high, wecouldn't get a vantage point","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1129",5856367,5858335,"I mean it's.. it's a fortress","Zero Dark Thirty"

"1161",6026067,6027967,"OK, now watch, it""takes her about 4 seconds","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1162",6028033,6029867,"to move from there, to the front door","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1163",6029868,6030935,"so she's on the older side","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1164",6031868,6032702,"what's that up there?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1165",6033132,6037132,"uhhh, those are kids, they are shuffling around,sword fighting or something with sticks","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1166",6037199,6039600,"you can see the height relativeto this, these are cows","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1167",6039900,6042635,"so they're between 7 and9, boys, definitely","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1168",6042701,6044534,"OK, your female is moving fast","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1169",6044600,6046734,"OK, that's what I wanted to showyou, can we pause this please?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1170",6047567,6048667,"that's not the same lady","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1171",6049399,6050567,"that's female number 3","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1172",6053466,6054301,"so you found...","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1173",6054766,6055966,"2 males, 3 females","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1174",6056300,6057001,"that's correct","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1175",6059434,6062167,"(George) so if there are 3females, there ought to be 3 males","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1176",6062967,6065368,"observant Muslim womenlive with their parents","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1177",6065833,6066768,"or with their husbands","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1178",6067801,6070534,"we think there's a thirdfamily, living in the house","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1179",6071833,6074435,"so this third male you've identifiedas possibly being Bin Laden","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1180",6074634,6077033,"do I give up all hope of everseeing a photograph of him?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1181",6078266,6080068,"hope?.. yeah","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1182",6080967,6082836,"you give up your hope, right now","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1183",6083734,6085134,"we scan for heat signatures","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1184",6086132,6089199,"but we can't validate if it'sa man or a woman up there","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1185",6091067,6095199,"we talked about burrowing a pinhole camera,but there's a high risk of discovery","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1186",6097567,6098699,"we found a safe house","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1187",6099033,6103033,"but we can't get a vantage point tofire a telescope over the balcony wall","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1188",6103300,6106432,"we have explored thepossibility of digging tunnels","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1189",6106501,6108068,"of sending hot air baloons","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1190",6108266,6112934,"of rerouting supply C-130s to take apeek, but that might be too alerting","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1191",6113567,6117167,"we looked for ways of collectingavailable DNA from his trash","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1192",6117234,6119634,"you know looking for his toothbrush,but they burn the trash","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1193",6121333,6123667,"we started a vaccination program","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1194",6124067,6126533,"sent a doctor to the house,see if he could pull blood","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1195",6130701,6132100,"but that didn't work out","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1196",6134100,6135667,"we thought about sendinga guy with a bucket","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1197",6136033,6139100,"to pull a sample from the sewerto analyze his fecal matter","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1198",6139167,6140501,"what was wrong with that, exactly","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1199",6141701,6143502,"what was wrong with that? that, uh","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1200",6145234,6146600,"the sample would be too diluted","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1201",6147533,6151068,"and it's asking too much to get a voiceconfirmation with him on the phone?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1202",6151801,6155801,"they don't make telephone calls from thecompound, we pulled the cell tower nearby","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1203",6156100,6160233,"and I'm also gonna give up hope thathe might ever get in that white SUV... and","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1204",6162367,6165335,"drive around a bit and we could see him?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1205",6166132,6167265,"don't they get groceries?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1206",6167900,6170033,"the unidentified third maledoes not get groceries","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1207",6170900,6172167,"he does not leave the compound","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1208",6172234,6174202,"he does not present himself for photographs","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1209",6174501,6178634,"when he needs fresh air, he pacesaround beneath a grape arbor","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1210",6179533,6183001,"but the leaves are so thick,they obscure our satellite views","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1211",6183067,6186967,"this is a professionalattempt to avoid detection","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1212",6187701,6189135,"OK? real tradecraft...","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1213",6190801,6194801,"the only people we've seen behave in thisway are other top level Al Queda operatives","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1214",6195533,6197435,"we did a red team on your analysis","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1215",6198367,6202167,"according to them, this behavior couldbelong to someone other than Al Queda","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1216",6202501,6207734,"they did give a 40% chance that the unidentifiedthird man is a senior Al Queda operative","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1217",6208399,6211600,"but they also said there's a 35%chance he's a Saudi drug dealer","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1218",6211934,6213934,"15% chance he's a Kuwati arms smuggler","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1219",6214067,6216266,"10% chance he's one ofthe relatives of the brothers","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1220",6217167,6218400,"basically we agree with you","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1221",6218466,6221600,"the house screams security, itscream someone who wants privacy","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1222",6221900,6223068,"it even screams bad guy","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1223",6223167,6224801,"but it does not scream Bin Laden","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1224",6225033,6225966,"you get the point?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1225",6226466,6229466,"if you can't prove it's Bin Laden, thenat least prove it's not someone else","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1226",6230634,6231634,"like a drug dealer","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1227",6236868,6240868,"you know we lost the ability to provethat when we lost the detainee program","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1228",6241199,6243332,"who the hell am I supposed to ask?... Huh?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1229",6244734,6246368,"some guy in Gitmo who's all lawyered up?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1230",6246501,6248835,"he'll just tell hislawyer to warn Bin Laden","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1231",6252701,6254100,"you'll think of something","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1232",6272132,6275934,"he'd be the first successful drugdealer never to have dealt drugs","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1233",6276667,6278800,"he has no internet access to the house","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1234",6279033,6281367,"he makes no phone calls, either in or out","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1235",6281801,6282868,"who's he selling to?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1236",6283033,6284934,"who's he buying from, how'she making his money?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1237",6285399,6288533,"and if you were to say ""he's retired"",I'd say ""where's the swimming pool?""","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1238",6289501,6292034,"where's the gold cage with the falcons?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1239",6293533,6298801,"and why does he send his courier to the two citiesin Pakistan we most associate with Al Queda","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1240",6298967,6301769,"that have nothing particularlyto do with heroin production","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1241",6303000,6307234,"the President is a thoughtful,analytical guy, he needs proof","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1242",6319766,6320701,"go ahead you guys","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1243",6324300,6325801,"I gotta say, your job...","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1244",6328701,6330967,"I just don't get the rythms in politics","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1245",6331567,6332801,"oh, you think this is political","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1246",6333167,6337434,"if this were political, we'd be having this conversationin October when theres an election bump","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1247",6337766,6339167,"this is pure risk","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1248",6339501,6343600,"based on deductive reasoning,inference, supposition","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1249",6343734,6347134,"and the only human reportingyou have is 6 years old","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1250",6347266,6349734,"from detainees who werequestioned under duress","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1251",6349900,6352435,"the political move here is totell you to go fuck yourself","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1252",6352567,6357801,"and remind you that I was in the roomwhen your old boss pitched WMD Iraq","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1253",6358567,6360435,"at least there you guys brought photographs","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1254",6360567,6363033,"you know you're right, I agreewith everything you just said","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1255",6364634,6366967,"what I meant was, a manin your position...","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1256",6368667,6371800,"how do you evaluate the riskof not doing something?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1257",6373167,6373600,"hmm?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1258",6374300,6377500,"the risk of potentially letting BinLaden slip through your fingers","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1259",6379533,6381068,"that is a facinating question","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1260",6385667,6386301,"hey","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1261",6391300,6392833,"I'm not saying we're gonna do it...","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1262",6394167,6396567,"but the President wants toknow if we were going to act","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1263",6397634,6398534,"how would we do it?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1264",6399600,6400435,"give us options","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1265",6435333,6436935,"technically these don't exist","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1266",6437434,6439768,"I actually tried to kill thisprogram a couple of times","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1267",6441266,6444068,"they've gone through aninitial round of testing","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1268",6444234,6446768,"and they have excellent radar defeat","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1269",6447199,6449266,"we just haven't texted themwith people in them yet","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1270",6450234,6454135,"you'll notice the stealth panels.similar to what we use on the B-2","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1271",6454501,6456835,"the rotors have been muffledwith decible killers","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1272",6457199,6460600,"It's slower than a Blackhawk andlacks the offense and the stability","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1273",6461132,6462001,"but it can hide","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1274",6462466,6466567,"so, ah, excuse me, but whatdo we need this for in Libya","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1275",6466667,6468600,"I mean, Gaddafi's anti airis virtually non-existant","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1276",6470734,6472635,"Maya, do you wanna brief them?","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1277",6481132,6484899,"there are two narratives about thelocation of Osama Bin Laden","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1278",6485434,6489567,"the one that you are most familiar with is thatUBL is hiding in a cave in the tribal areas","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1279",6490167,6492768,"that he's surrounded by a largecontingent of loyal fighters","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1280",6493833,6497167,"but that narrative is pre9/11 understanding of UBL","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1281",6497734,6498635,"the second narrative","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1282",6499501,6500568,"is that he's living in a city","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1283",6501300,6504567,"living in a city with multiplepoints of egress and entry","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1284",6505199,6506600,"access to communications","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1285",6507199,6509332,"so that he can keep in touchwith the organization","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1286",6510900,6514167,"you can't run a global network ofinterconnected cells from a cave","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1287",6514868,6516635,"we've located an individual we believe,","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1288",6516701,6520234,"based on detainee reporting,is Bin Laden's courier","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1289",6521100,6524001,"he's living in a housein Abbottabad Pakistan","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1290",6524399,6525900,"and we assess","Zero Dark Thirty"
"1291",6527868,6530335,"that one of the otheroccupants of the house","Zero Dark Thirty"

"1424",6440257,6443567,"I'm three months pregnant, so thatmight have something to do with it.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1425",6443802,6445315,"- Really?- Yeah.","Something's Gotta Give"

"1431",6461487,6463842,"- I'm famous?- Just to us.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1432",6464407,6468241,"In every interview my mom does,she always says she made you up.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1433",6468495,6472488,"So the guy in the play doesn't make it,does he?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1434",6475502,6478812,"He basically diesat the end of the second act.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1435",6479715,6481751,"But it gets a huge laugh.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1436",6482426,6484860,"I was hoping she'd give me a reprieve.","Something's Gotta Give"

"1452",6622738,6626731,"At first I thought I hadthe wrong restaurant, but here you are.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1453",6627576,6628850,"Just like I imagined.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1454",6628994,6631189,"You mean we're not justbumping into each other?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1455",6631372,6633363,"You came here to see me?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1456",6633916,6636430,"I'm aware it was a bold move...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1457",6636627,6639539,"one of those impulses that grabs you...","Something's Gotta Give"

"1459",6644719,6646198,"I mean, I kind of...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1460",6646345,6650133,"It would be greatif you'd let me take that as a yes.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1461",6651267,6652859,"Would you like a glass of wine?","Something's Gotta Give"

"1464",6667659,6668808,"Okay.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1465",6669828,6671102,"Awkward.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1466",6674291,6678250,"You remember how you saidif we still knew each other...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1467",6678504,6681257,"we should go to Paris for our birthdays?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1468",6682967,6685640,"- We still know each other.- That's true.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1469",6686846,6690122,"But, Harry, I haven't heard from youin six months.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1470",6691100,6692215,"Yeah.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1471",6692852,6697130,"After I saw you in the theatrethat afternoon with the dancing Henrys...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1472",6697398,6701835,"- Yes. Sorry.- No, it's very funny, by the way.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1473",6702737,6706047,"- I had another episode.- I'm sorry.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1474",6706574,6710283,"As it turned out, I was fine,but I was sure I was dying.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1475",6710662,6715292,"The doctor in the ER saidI needed to decompress.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1476",6716501,6717616,"So I did.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1477",6717753,6720347,"I walked out of there and changed my life.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1478",6720547,6723937,"Sold most of my businesses,packed my bags...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1479",6724718,6727027,"moved to an island in the Caribbean.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1480",6727221,6730338,"That is where you've been all this time?In the Caribbean?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1481",6730558,6732196,"Actually, no.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1482",6732726,6736116,"I was there about six hourswhen it occurred to me...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1483",6736355,6738550,"that wasting awayon an island in the Caribbean...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1484",6738733,6741008,"couldn't possibly cure what was ailing me.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1485",6741444,6744356,"So I decided to take another kind of trip...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1486",6744655,6748443,"into, let's call it my past.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1487",6748868,6749903,"Your past?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1488",6750036,6752596,"I thought if I visitedsome of the women I'd known...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1489",6752789,6756065,"maybe I could figure outhow I arrived at being me.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1490",6758253,6761006,"Yeah, it was quite a journey.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1491",6762007,6764157,"Hi, Louise. You remember me?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1492",6765636,6766989,"Hi, how are...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1493",6768055,6770205,"Some of the ladies, I'll admit...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1494",6770390,6774099,"weren't too interested in seeing meor even speaking to me.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1495",6774353,6777743,"But one day, my losing streak ended.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1496",6778190,6780181,"One of them opened up to me.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1497",6780359,6782714,"Hearing what she had to saywas no picnic...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1498",6782903,6784541,"but I stuck it out and listened.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1499",6784697,6786096,"And then I listened harder.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1500",6786240,6788071,"And one of the things I realized...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1501",6788242,6792554,"was I was actually giving closureto generations of women.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1502",6793665,6796577,"When you hear the same storyabout yourself...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1503",6796793,6800468,"over and over, your life begins to add up.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1504",6801881,6803997,"It took me months to find them all.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1505",6804175,6806609,"Visited a dozen different states.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1506",6807888,6810561,"But I travelled the farthest to see you.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1507",6818774,6820526,"I don't believe it.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1508",6823779,6825132,"Me, either.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1509",6826365,6829277,"- Doc, how are you?- I'm good.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1510",6829493,6831643,"- Nice to see you.- You, too.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1511",6831829,6833740,"I should have told you he was coming...","Something's Gotta Give"
"1512",6833915,6836554,"but I was so engrossed in your story.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1513",6836834,6838392,"Sorry I'm late.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1514",6839087,6840486,"What story?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1515",6840838,6842590,"Maybe another time.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1516",6843174,6846007,"So I guess I should have seen your play.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1517",6846386,6848217,"I would have known how this ended.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1518",6848388,6850299,"- Yeah, big twist.- Yeah.","Something's Gotta Give"
"1519",6851057,6853525,"So what are you doing over here, man?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1520",6853727,6855763,"Just a vacation.","Something's Gotta Give"

"1525",6868242,6871598,"- I've just been to every store in the city.- What?","Something's Gotta Give"
"1526",6872288,6875598,"This woman is impossible to buy for,but I think...","Something's Gotta Give"

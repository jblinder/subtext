"15",246167,248160,"I could save the college.","Flubber"
"16",248294,250501,"A new energy sourcewould be worth a fortune.","Flubber"
"17",250630,253916,"You better hurry up. The loan's dueat the end of the school year.","Flubber"

"32",292883,294793,"They can't justclose down the school.","Flubber"
"33",294885,297673,"Outside of the Ivy League,name me one private college...","Flubber"
"34",297805,301139,"or university that isn'tin financial trouble.","Flubber"
"35",301225,303977,"Oh, all right. Name another.","Flubber"
"36",304062,308890,"- You don't think it's too much?- No. It's elegant.","Flubber"
"37",309025,312691,"And it's a wonderful idea to gowith the big wedding this time.","Flubber"
"38",312779,315946,"It does put the pressureon the professor to show up.","Flubber"
"39",316074,318447,"If he forgets this time,that's it.","Flubber"
"40",318577,321199,"Well, in his case,once is justifiable...","Flubber"

"46",348442,350565,"and the dead pheasant,","Flubber"
"47",350694,352568,"but it does not countas extra credit.","Flubber"
"48",352696,355401,"Last time we were talking aboutNewton's Law of Gravitation.","Flubber"
"49",355491,359987,"To review: We see this ""G""is like the ""C"" in E=MC squared.","Flubber"
"50",360121,363241,"It's a constant, constant universe,as much as anything
is constant in the universe.","Flubber"
"51",363374,365747,"It's saying that the force ofattraction between two bodies...","Flubber"
"52",365877,368629,"is in direct proportion tothe product of their masses...","Flubber"
"53",368755,370997,"and in inverse proportion to the squareof the distance between them.","Flubber"
"54",371133,376589,"An example would be-- Let's make, uh,naked man, ""M-1."" Naked lady, ""M-2.""","Flubber"
"55",376680,378922,"Now, according to this formula,their attractive forces...","Flubber"
"56",379058,381762,"would want to closethe distance to zero.","Flubber"
"57",381894,384765,"Why don't they? Hmm?","Flubber"
"58",384897,386854,"The Earth! Ah.","Flubber"
"59",386983,390933,"So, in essence that isgravity and this...","Flubber"
"60",391070,394938,"is ""Dr Richards Life Drawing.""","Flubber"
"61",395074,397447,"It's not my class, is it?","Flubber"

"236",1250228,1252517,"Ouch.","Flubber"
"237",1258528,1261019,"- Thank you for waiting so long.- Yes, ma'am.","Flubber"
"238",1268539,1270413,"I'm sorry, Sara.","Flubber"
"239",1272084,1274207,"Are you going to tell me,""I told you so""?","Flubber"
"240",1274295,1276371,"No, no.","Flubber"
"241",1276505,1279376,"- I'm going to give you a ride home.- Thank you.","Flubber"
"242",1283763,1285803,"There you are.","Flubber"
"243",1285932,1288423,"Careful. Watch your gown.","Flubber"
"244",1288560,1290849,"I've got it. Thank you.","Flubber"
"245",1297569,1301069,"It's perfectly safe, Weebo. It's justan ordinary radioactive isotope...","Flubber"
"246",1302950,1306699,"that Weber is now removingfrom the lead containment unit.","Flubber"
"247",1307830,1310286,"Very good, Weber.","Flubber"
"248",1310416,1312658,"Then you placethe radioactive isotope...","Flubber"
"249",1312794,1315332,"carefully behindthe sliding shutter.","Flubber"
"250",1317299,1319790,"You see, the sliding shutterworks just like a camera.","Flubber"
"251",1319926,1321753,"It regulates the flowof gamma radiation.","Flubber"
"252",1321845,1326092,"Instead of billions of random particles,you have a precise stream of energy.","Flubber"
"253",1326225,1331812,"Now we carefully placethe sliding shutter mechanism...","Flubber"
"254",1331939,1334477,"underneath the flubber.","Flubber"
"255",1334608,1337100,"And I'm burning up in here!Weebo!","Flubber"
"256",1337236,1339110,"Over here.","Flubber"
"257",1339238,1342275,"The gamma radiation triggers ametastable decay in the flubber itself.","Flubber"
"258",1342367,1344276,"- Right.- Which releases enormous
quantities of energy,","Flubber"
"259",1344369,1346278,"- and that's what propels the flubber.- Of course.","Flubber"
"260",1346371,1348529,"Now doing it this way,I believe, is a lot more scientific...","Flubber"
"261",1348665,1350539,"than dropping itor kicking it...","Flubber"
"262",1350667,1352707,"or bombarding itwith light bulb photon flashes.","Flubber"
"263",1352836,1356454,"- Absolutely.- I believe...","Flubber"
"264",1356548,1359300,"by controllingthe gamma radiation flux,","Flubber"
"265",1359385,1364213,"we can control the movementof the flubber itself.","Flubber"
"266",1364348,1366970,"- Cross your fingers, Weebo.- Here's hoping!
- Good luck.","Flubber"
"267",1372023,1375309,"Oh, yes!","Flubber"
"268",1375443,1377732,"It works!","Flubber"
"269",1381742,1383699,"Descent, gradually.","Flubber"
"270",1386663,1389665,"Back up again. Yeah!","Flubber"
"271",1394338,1397174,"My wedding. Oh!","Flubber"
"272",1397258,1399334,"- I've gotta go, Weebo.- But you haven't finished
the experiment yet.","Flubber"
"273",1399469,1402304,"You're just getting started.You can't just stop in the middle.","Flubber"
"274",1402388,1405010,"The wedding. Oh, I can'tmiss this one, Weebo.","Flubber"
"275",1405100,1407176,"I'm aware of the time.Thank you.","Flubber"
"276",1407269,1409938,"But your days are wrong.I'm getting married Friday, 6:30 p.m.","Flubber"
"277",1410063,1413682,"- No. No, you're not.- Why not?","Flubber"
"278",1413775,1416777,"Because you're notgetting married, Phillip.","Flubber"
"279",1416904,1419858,"- Yes, I am.- You missed the wedding.","Flubber"
"280",1419949,1423365,"It's 6:30 in the morning.","Flubber"
"281",1423494,1425866,"No. No.","Flubber"
"282",1425997,1428404,"Yes. I'm sorry.","Flubber"
"283",1434214,1436705,"- It is?- Yeah.","Flubber"
"284",1439177,1441585,"Sara.","Flubber"
"285",1469126,1471035,"Sara?","Flubber"
"286",1474715,1477467,"You have a lot of nerveto show your face around here...","Flubber"
"287",1477593,1480428,"after what you did to melast night.","Flubber"
"288",1480513,1483264,"Will you please let me explain?","Flubber"
"289",1483391,1488598,"No. There's nothing to explain.You weren't there.","Flubber"
"290",1488688,1491440,"For the third time you left mestanding at the altar.","Flubber"
"291",1493568,1496273,"I'm sorry with all my heart.","Flubber"
"292",1496363,1498521,"But please listen to me, Sara.Please. You know me.","Flubber"
"293",1498657,1501444,"You know how sometimes I can getreally fixated on an idea?","Flubber"
"294",1501535,1503444,"- I don't want to hear it.- Sara, you've got to hear it.","Flubber"
"295",1503537,1508780,"Sara, this is the reasonI didn't make it last night.","Flubber"
"296",1510503,1513172,"It's flubber.","Flubber"
"297",1513297,1515835,"Flubber! It's a metastablecompound, Sara.","Flubber"
"298",1515967,1518505,"In layman's terms, if you applya small amount of energy,","Flubber"
"299",1520430,1522304,"it liberates an enormousquantity of energy.","Flubber"
"300",1522432,1524306,"But the total effectis transient, Sara.","Flubber"
"301",1524434,1528432,"The moment you stop applying energy,it returns to a quasi-plasmoid state.","Flubber"
"302",1528522,1532306,"- Isn't it remarkable, Sara?- What's remarkable, Phillip,","Flubber"
"303",1532442,1534316,"is that I ever fellin love with you.","Flubber"
"304",1534445,1537648,"You broke my heart...","Flubber"
"305",1537740,1539649,"so that you could stay homeand make some green goo.","Flubber"
"306",1539742,1541984,"Sara, it's much more than that.","Flubber"
"307",1542078,1545162,"Flubber could save this college.Let me demonstrate.","Flubber"
"308",1545248,1548533,"- No, no, no.- Just give me one minute, okay?","Flubber"
"309",1550879,1553286,"The flubber is placedin my back pocket.","Flubber"
"310",1553381,1556169,"When I exit this window,I will fall to the ground.","Flubber"
"311",1556259,1561420,"When I hit the ground, the flubber willsend me right back up unharmed. Watch.","Flubber"
"312",1569315,1572020,"- Ta-ta, my love.- Are you nuts?","Flubber"
"313",1572151,1575734,"- I'll be right back.- Phillip!","Flubber"
"314",1575863,1577274,"Ah!","Flubber"

"316",1583580,1585656,"Just my pride.","Flubber"
"317",1585749,1589450,"Well, if you think thatyou are going to get my sympathy,
you are wasting your time.","Flubber"

"325",1635635,1637924,"I got thrown offthe basketball team.","Flubber"
"326",1638012,1643683,"I flunked chemistry.I'm on, uh, academic probation.","Flubber"
"327",1643810,1646681,"- How did this happen?- I'm supposed to get A's.","Flubber"
"328",1646813,1649684,"- At least, that's what I was told.- The only reason...","Flubber"
"329",1649816,1652224,"I loaned this ""jerknut""college money...","Flubber"
"330",1652319,1656862,"was so he could get straight A'sand go to Harvard Business School.","Flubber"
"331",1656991,1659446,"- This isn't supposed to happen.- Yes, sir.","Flubber"
"332",1659535,1662987,"We talked to the, uh, that Brainard guy,the chemistry professor.","Flubber"
"333",1663122,1665792,"Now, either he did notunderstand us, or he forgot.","Flubber"
"334",1665917,1668372,"The-The boy knew we were havingpersuasion problems, sir.","Flubber"
"335",1668503,1672501,"I have a science requirement,you morons!","Flubber"

"377",1896410,1899245,"- You seen enough?- Plenty.","Flubber"
"378",1901499,1905544,"All right, after the bowlingball hits, we break for the car.","Flubber"
"379",1907046,1909716,"Oh, wait a minute.You can adjust it.","Flubber"
"380",1913553,1915712,"Go!","Flubber"
"381",1945462,1947371,"Oh, damn! Oh!","Flubber"
"382",1949216,1951375,"- Yes! Weebo?- Yes, sir?","Flubber"
"383",1951468,1953710,"- It's gonna work.- I hope so.","Flubber"
"384",1953804,1956176,"Now, let me show you how.","Flubber"
"385",1957600,1960684,"I connected the acceleratorto a sliding shutter.","Flubber"
"386",1960812,1963766,"If I press down on the accelerator,it releases the gamma rays,","Flubber"
"387",1963856,1965814,"and that increases the thrust.","Flubber"
"388",1965942,1968777,"Ah. Listen to that baby chirp.","Flubber"
"389",1968903,1972736,"Now, the steering wheelcontrols lateral motion.","Flubber"

"391",1974993,1976867,"- Okay.- it'll steer right.","Flubber"
"392",1976995,1980162,"- Ah! Turns right.- Turn the wheel left, it steers left.","Flubber"
"393",1980290,1983292,"So, it functions a lot likea normal automatic shift...","Flubber"
"394",1983377,1985666,"- with drive, park, neutral, reverse.- Yes, yes, yes, yes.","Flubber"
"395",1985796,1988632,"- It's that easy. See, Weebo?- Professor!","Flubber"

"408",2024045,2026619,"You know, maybe you shouldjust go without me.","Flubber"
"409",2026715,2029336,"- Why?- Because I get carsick.","Flubber"
"410",2029426,2031465,"- Oh, come on.You're not gonna blow chips.
- No?","Flubber"
"411",2031553,2033676,"- You don't have a stomach.- I have a queasy gyro.","Flubber"
"412",2033805,2037934,"Now get over it. This is notabout cars. This is about Sara.","Flubber"

"415",2045401,2048687,"Oh! We're fine now.","Flubber"
"416",2048779,2051187,"- Ah! Out into the world.- Okay, here we go.","Flubber"
"417",2051324,2054907,"Look at this! Let's seewhat this baby will do!","Flubber"
"418",2057580,2059953,"Oh! It works!","Flubber"
"419",2060083,2062040,"- Yes, it does.- I'm psyched!","Flubber"
"420",2062127,2065710,"Oh, boy.","Flubber"
"421",2065839,2067713,"- You know what this means, Weebo?- What?","Flubber"
"422",2067841,2070546,"I'll never haveto buy tyres again.","Flubber"
"423",2070636,2073092,"Ah. Let's see what'son the radio, Weebo.","Flubber"

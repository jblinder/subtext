"1157",5300829,5302057,"happens.","Juggernaut"
"1158",5302831,5304799,"Just like that, Captain.","Juggernaut"
"1159",5310472,5312372,"The tea break is over.","Juggernaut"
"1160",5322818,5325446,"You can generally see where I've been.","Juggernaut"

"1169",5385314,5386508,"Jesus.","Juggernaut"
"1170",5388283,5389807,"There's a wire.","Juggernaut"
"1171",5391019,5392509,"Just a thread.","Juggernaut"
"1172",5393622,5395146,"I can hardly see it.","Juggernaut"
"1173",5396625,5399185,"The contacts are electrically closed.","Juggernaut"
"1174",5399261,5401126,"Charlie's strip must have broken the wire.","Juggernaut"
"1175",5401697,5404598,"- What's your next procedure?- Shut up, Jeff!","Juggernaut"
"1176",5406268,5409066,"Clamping the contacts. It's very delicate.","Juggernaut"

"1236",5748643,5751077,"How do we check? How do we find out?","Juggernaut"
"1237",5752147,5754547,"I was working with Sid Buckland.","Juggernaut"
"1238",5755150,5756811,"I was on his team.","Juggernaut"

"1249",5810905,5812099,"Bingo!","Juggernaut"
"1250",5812774,5814765,"Different sort of metal.","Juggernaut"
"1251",5822384,5824511,"It'll cut. High-speed drill.","Juggernaut"
"1252",5825020,5828217,"- Won't it set off the trembler fuse?- It's a coarse trembler.","Juggernaut"
"1253",5828289,5829654,"Fine drill.","Juggernaut"
"1254",5831426,5833792,"If it was easy, everybody would be doing it.","Juggernaut"
"1255",5833862,5836262,"And then what would become of us?","Juggernaut"
"1256",5836698,5837790,"Off you go, Digby.","Juggernaut"
"1257",5838600,5842001,"I'll see you when I've discoveredthe secret of the universe.","Juggernaut"

"1260",5861856,5863881,"That trick land mine, how was it fused?","Juggernaut"
"1261",5865393,5868385,"We never found out. Ran like thieves.","Juggernaut"
"1262",5869497,5872295,"Blew up three blocks.The blast broke my leg.","Juggernaut"
"1263",5872367,5875598,"Everything was burning.Buckland dragged me out.","Juggernaut"

"1273",5929557,5931422,"I shall miss all that.","Juggernaut"
"1274",5932160,5935755,"- What's this thing he can't reach?- The fusing mechanism.","Juggernaut"
"1275",5936698,5938495,"The secret of it all?","Juggernaut"
"1276",5939200,5940462,"Yes.","Juggernaut"
"1277",5940802,5943100,"Two hours to reachyour fusing mechanism...","Juggernaut"
"1278",5943171,5946800,"and you must get onwith your master's business.","Juggernaut"
"1279",5946875,5949935,"If it's any consolation, Fallon tells me...","Juggernaut"
"1280",5950979,5953470,"that 1,200 deaths don't matter.","Juggernaut"
"1281",5954082,5956983,"A speck of dust in the eye of the universe.","Juggernaut"

"1284",5964192,5965523,"But one...","Juggernaut"
"1285",5965727,5968287,"you can care about one person, Alex.","Juggernaut"
"1286",5969397,5971058,"Is there someone?","Juggernaut"
"1287",5971800,5972858,"Yes.","Juggernaut"
"1288",5975436,5976903,"And is it me?","Juggernaut"
"1289",5982210,5983700,"You're wanted.","Juggernaut"
"1290",5996724,5999693,"Fallon's found the fuse.He's afraid the bomb's going to blow.","Juggernaut"
"1291",5999761,6003060,"- All passengers stand by lifeboats.- Lifeboats, sir.","Juggernaut"
"1292",6012740,6015732,"There are two wiresfrom the top of the detonator.","Juggernaut"
"1293",6015810,6017334,"One red, one blue.","Juggernaut"
"1294",6018012,6019980,"One fires the detonator.","Juggernaut"
"1295",6020648,6022377,"Thus the big bang.","Juggernaut"
"1296",6024118,6027451,"I'm afraid I don't knowwhat the other one does.","Juggernaut"

"1305",6132727,6134854,"I've just been bitten again.","Juggernaut"
"1306",6137298,6139323,"Will the sea be very cold?","Juggernaut"
"1307",6140902,6143097,"In my professional opinion...","Juggernaut"
"1308",6143938,6145166,"not hot.","Juggernaut"
"1309",6145873,6147966,"And it will ruin your hair.","Juggernaut"
"1310",6148476,6152640,"In your professional capacity,you're supposed to be cheering us up.","Juggernaut"
"1311",6154282,6156341,"There aren't any icebergs.","Juggernaut"
"1312",6157418,6158442,"Correction.","Juggernaut"
"1313",6161422,6163754,"Fallon, this is London Control.","Juggernaut"
"1314",6165393,6167953,"- Tony, this is Jeff speaking.- Where's Buckland?","Juggernaut"
"1315",6168096,6170963,"He's with the police.He doesn't want to talk about the bombs.","Juggernaut"
"1316",6171032,6172192,"I want Buckland.","Juggernaut"
"1317",6173534,6177368,"The time is 6:01. The mission is terminated.","Juggernaut"
"1318",6177438,6179998,"Like hell it is. I know how he's done it.","Juggernaut"
"1319",6180074,6182304,"It's just one small step. I'm nearly there.","Juggernaut"
"1320",6182377,6185210,"It's 6:02. Take your men above decks.","Juggernaut"
"1321",6185279,6188373,"My men will stay on till they've donewhat they came aboard to do.","Juggernaut"
"1322",6188583,6190983,"Now stop pissing aboutand get me Buckland!","Juggernaut"
"1323",6195256,6196348,"Why?","Juggernaut"
"1324",6196858,6201124,"I can't explain what they did to me,not in official police jargon, that is.","Juggernaut"
"1325",6201195,6204562,"- Who are they?- They teach you how to dismantle bombs...","Juggernaut"
"1326",6204632,6206031,"save lives.","Juggernaut"
"1327",6206334,6210566,"But they didn't pay you enough,so you learn how to design bombs.","Juggernaut"
"1328",6210905,6213430,"Taking lives, that pays much better.","Juggernaut"
"1329",6214008,6218138,"And then one day you're old,and they give you a miserable pension.","Juggernaut"
"1330",6222216,6223945,"I'm still good at my job.","Juggernaut"
"1331",6224318,6228015,"Fallon refuses to leave.He insists on talking to Buckland.","Juggernaut"
"1332",6232527,6234290,"I'll talk to Fallon.","Juggernaut"
"1333",6236664,6240031,"And you think we should give wayto people like that?","Juggernaut"
"1334",6240168,6242193,"You make people like that.","Juggernaut"
"1335",6250778,6253212,"It's all right, Tony, he's coming.","Juggernaut"
"1336",6255316,6256681,"Hello, Sid.","Juggernaut"
"1337",6257318,6259081,"This is Tony Fallon.","Juggernaut"
"1338",6259620,6262453,"If we're still on speaking terms, that is.","Juggernaut"
"1339",6262590,6265684,"I'd like to apologize right here and now...","Juggernaut"
"1340",6266160,6267957,"for whatever it is I did.","Juggernaut"
"1341",6269864,6271058,"Buckland.","Juggernaut"
"1342",6271132,6272895,"It's a joyous noise.","Juggernaut"
"1343",6273267,6275360,"I'm sorry it's you, Fallon.","Juggernaut"
"1344",6275536,6277629,"I'm sorry it's me, as well.","Juggernaut"
"1345",6277705,6280173,"I thought you'd taught meeverything I knew, Sid.","Juggernaut"
"1346",6280241,6281936,"But there's a missing link...","Juggernaut"
"1347",6282009,6284273,"that's making me a little nervous.","Juggernaut"
"1348",6284345,6286905,"I know you remember being nervous.","Juggernaut"
"1349",6287281,6289215,"Bear with me, Sid.","Juggernaut"
"1350",6289450,6291975,"There's a red wire, and a blue wire.","Juggernaut"
"1351",6293121,6295351,"One trips off the detonator.","Juggernaut"
"1352",6295790,6298452,"The other is a booby trap, the sucker punch.","Juggernaut"
"1353",6299360,6302329,"Now that's perfectly diagnosed,wouldn't you say?","Juggernaut"
"1354",6302396,6303658,"Perfect.","Juggernaut"
"1355",6304265,6306062,"Time's pressing, Sid.","Juggernaut"
"1356",6307168,6309466,"I think in about three minutes.","Juggernaut"
"1357",6312306,6314638,"I'm going to cut the blue wire.","Juggernaut"
"1358",6315776,6317437,"My lads will wait.","Juggernaut"
"1359",6318112,6320205,"If I go in the wrong way...","Juggernaut"
"1360",6320448,6322416,"they'll know what to do.","Juggernaut"
"1361",6323651,6325016,"Am I right?","Juggernaut"
"1362",6327288,6330155,"Is it the blue wire, Sid?","Juggernaut"
"1363",6334462,6335861,"Two minutes.","Juggernaut"
"1364",6336531,6338590,"Sid, it's too late to run.","Juggernaut"
"1365",6339000,6340194,"And furthermore...","Juggernaut"
"1366",6340268,6343533,"I freely acknowledgethat you are still the governor.","Juggernaut"
"1367",6344972,6346837,"And one other point...","Juggernaut"
"1368",6349510,6351307,"I'm very frightened.","Juggernaut"
"1369",6351946,6355313,"And I know you remember, precisely,what I'm feeling.","Juggernaut"
"1370",6358152,6359881,"All for the sake...","Juggernaut"

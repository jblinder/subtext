"1130",5719546,5724599,"If anyone wishes to make a statement, heor she can do so at the meeting's end.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1131",5724719,5726015,"Thank you.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1132",5728931,5732686,"[Poirot] Ladies and gentlemen, you areall aware that a repulsive murderer","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1133",5732810,5737030,"has himself been repulsivelyand perhaps deservedly murdered.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1134",5737148,5740823,"How and why? Here is the simple answer.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1135",5740944,5742945,"There is evidence supporting the theory","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1136",5743070,5745368,"that the murderer wasa stranger to us all.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1137",5745489,5750837,"Mrs Hubbard was conscious of a manin her compartment soon after 1:15am.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1138",5750953,5756586,"She later found near her bedsidethe button of a wagon-lit conductor.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1139",5756708,5760759,"Fréulein Schmidt discovered,planted in her suitcase,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1140",5760880,5765726,"the uniform of a conductor, which couldnot possibly have fitted Pierre,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1141",5765842,5769016,"and from which, in fact,there was a button missing.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1142",5769137,5775270,"And in the trouser pocket of the uniformwas a conductor's passkey.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1143",5775395,5780868,"Later still, Mrs Hubbard discoveredthis bloodstained dagger,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1144",5780984,5785784,"which Dr Constantine confirmscould have been the murderer's weapon.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1145",5786948,5791498,"The obvious implicationis that the murderer,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1146",5791618,5795043,"disguised as a conductor,boarded the train at Belgrade,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1147",5795163,5799293,"made his way by means of the convenientpasskey to Ratchett's compartment,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1148",5799418,5803344,"stabbed him to death,planted the dagger and the uniform,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1149",5803463,5808095,"and then departed, since the trainwas now halted in a snowdrift.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1150",5808219,5812975,"Who was he? I am inclinedto agree with Mr Foscarelli,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1151",5813099,5815978,"who believes that he wasa rival member of the Mafia,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1152",5816101,5818399,"exacting private vengeancefor a vendetta","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1153",5818520,5823197,"whose precise nature the Yugoslav policewill undoubtedly identify.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1154",5825819,5828118,"But... is that all?","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1155",5828238,5832618,"No. No, no, no, no. No, it is not.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1156",5832743,5836465,"I said, here is the simple answer.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1157",5839375,5844176,"There is also a more... complex one.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1158",5847007,5853390,"But remember my first solution when I...when you've heard my second.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1159",5854931,5857935,"Let us, for the moment,assume what is perfectly plausible,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1160",5858060,5860734,"that the mysterious strangerdid not exist.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1161",5861689,5863690,"The murder must thenhave been committed","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1162",5863815,5867662,"by some person or personsin the Calais coach","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1163",5867779,5871658,"and therefore are now presentin this dining car.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1164",5872658,5875707,"Let us not, for the moment,ask the question “how"",","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1165",5875828,5879172,"but the question ""why"",which will tell us how.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1166",5880707,5883051,"I was not surprisedthat every single one of you","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1167",5883168,5886342,"should have heardof the notorious Armstrong case.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1168",5886463,5891435,"But I confess to a mild surprisewhen the first passenger I interrogated,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1169",5891551,5896353,"Mr McQueen, admitted,under emotional stress,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1170",5896474,5900774,"that he had actually knownMrs Armstrong, albeit very slightly.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1171",5900895,5903363,"She was gentle and frightened.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1172",5903480,5905529,"But not too frightenedto take an interest","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1173",5905649,5907778,"in a young man who wantedto go on the stage.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1174",5907902,5909949,"Was Mr McQueen lying","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1175",5910070,5914451,"when he denied ever having knownthat Ratchett was Cassetti?","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1176",5914574,5918500,"Or did he become Ratchett's secretaryas part of a deliberate plan","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1177",5918621,5921215,"to avenge Mrs Armstrong's death?","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1178",5922457,5924586,"Only by interrogatingthe other passengers","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1179",5924710,5926177,"could I hope to see the light.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1180",5926295,5928672,"But when I began to question them,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1181",5928797,5934100,"the light, as Macbeth would have said,thickened.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1182",5935095,5936894,"When I told the Princess Dragomiroff","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1183",5937014,5940234,"that I knew she wasMrs Armstrong's godmother,","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1184",5940350,5942524,"her answers to my subsequent questions","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1185",5942645,5946615,"smelled stronglyof inaccuracy and evasion.","Murder on the Orient Express"
"1186",5946731,5951238,"Even I knew more from readingthe newspaper reports","Murder on the Orient Express"

"1193",5970922,5974802,"There was no need to speakwith Mrs Armstrong's.","Murder on the Orient Express"

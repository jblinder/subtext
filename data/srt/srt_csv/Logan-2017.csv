"877",3562976,3565070,"This is NASCAR'sgreatest distance","Logan"

"879",3567813,3571034,"It'll take 400 lapsto complete 600 miles.","Logan"
"880",3571275,3572335,"And Mike, you know,","Logan"
"881",3572360,3573963,"one of the storieswe're all gonna be watching is","Logan"
"882",3573987,3576748,"this guy Dayton White, as he returnsto racing after a two-year break.","Logan"
"883",3576782,3579831,"And Jeff, you certainly know what it'slike to get back behind the wheel","Logan"
"884",3580034,3581126,"after some time off.","Logan"
"885",3581202,3583045,"Can we really expectthis guy to run up front?","Logan"
"886",3583329,3584922,"Well, that truly isthe question, D.W.","Logan"
"887",3584998,3586840,"And, yeah,it is extremely tough.","Logan"
"888",3587041,3589840,"So much has changed since thelast time he was in the car.","Logan"
"889",3589960,3590961,"The cars have changed.","Logan"
"890",3591045,3593173,"The setups have changed,the competition's changed.","Logan"
"891",3593380,3594983,"And you know,you just can't underestimate","Logan"
"892",3595007,3596931,"the mental focusand endurance needed","Logan"
"893",3597010,3599512,"to get back behind the wheelafter this long of a break.","Logan"
"894",3599846,3602143,"Well, focus,endurance and discipline","Logan"
"895",3602224,3604851,"could well describeDayton's off-track routine.","Logan"
"896",3605059,3606481,"We caught up withhim as he prepared","Logan"
"897",3606561,3609530,"for this highlyanticipated return to racing.","Logan"
"898",3610856,3613530,"There's a team ofpeople looking after my car.","Logan"
"899",3613735,3616362,"Making sure everythingis operating at full capacity.","Logan"
"900",3617030,3619704,"So it makes sense that I dothat for my physical self.","Logan"
"901",3619907,3622878,"Because I'm not just a driver,I'm an athlete.","Logan"
"902",3624204,3627833,"Once I began sourcingreally clean software,","Logan"
"903",3627916,3632045,"I noticed a total differencein my clarity and performance.","Logan"
"904",3632586,3634429,"Software's whatI call my food.","Logan"
"905",3635090,3636807,"Because,when you think about it,","Logan"
"906",3636882,3639762,"your body is youroperating system.","Logan"
"907",3640137,3643061,"So when your OS mayfeel like it's working fine,","Logan"
"908",3643139,3646018,"a problem with software can makeyour computer not perform properly.","Logan"
"909",3646101,3648353,"Even crash.","Logan"
"910",3648436,3651780,"So eating only clean software,making sure my OS","Logan"
"911",3652065,3655614,"is working at an optimum leveland all this will help me win.","Logan"
"912",3664786,3667630,"Speed up the drops.We'll figure the numbers out later.","Logan"
"913",3687099,3689773,"No energy drink on the marketcomes in a magnum, right?","Logan"
"914",3690061,3692940,"But I had 10 cases of thesebabies made just for today.","Logan"
"915",3693148,3695947,"I'll have a little now, beforethe race, some during the race,","Logan"
"916",3696025,3698199,"And come lap 600and that checkered flag,","Logan"
"917",3698485,3701989,"I think we're all gonna be finishingthese puppies off in victory. Huh?","Logan"
"918",3702489,3704833,"You got us all in the shot?Me and the car?","Logan"
"919",3705159,3707304,"So I've got this racing suit andI've got my helmet right here,","Logan"
"920",3707329,3709376,"just want to make sureyou can see that. Huh?","Logan"
"921",3711498,3713842,"I've been carefully monitoringmy glucose levels.","Logan"
"922",3714126,3717472,"So I'm really in a sweet spotright now for sustained energy.","Logan"
"923",3718088,3722014,"You're the To The Max driver.You got to drink.","Logan"
"924",3723177,3725556,"Maybe you should think aboutthose four years of back taxes","Logan"
"925",3725639,3727516,"that this drinkis paying for, huh?","Logan"
"926",3730309,3731356,"Yeah, go on!","Logan"
"927",3731436,3732527,"- Go on!- Come on.","Logan"

"1607",6722925,6724722,"so less air gets mixed in.","Logan"
"1608",6724801,6727304,"That's why it hassuch a silky texture.","Logan"
"1609",6727637,6728810,"A churn rate, huh?","Logan"
"1610",6729139,6732143,"Yeah, a churn rate. How fast thepaddle in the machine moves.","Logan"

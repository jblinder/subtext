"231",2565085,2567922,"His background is even more frightful.","Stalker"
"232",2568713,2571800,"Several times in prison,then he was harmed here.","Stalker"
"233",2572300,2575804,"He has a mutant daughter,a victim of the Zone as they call it.","Stalker"
"234",2576012,2577264,"They say she's got no legs.","Stalker"
"235",2581853,2584396,"And what about this Porcupine?","Stalker"
"236",2585481,2587858,"What does it mean, was punished ?","Stalker"
"237",2589068,2590652,"Or was it just a figure of speech?","Stalker"
"238",2593739,2598494,"One day Porcupine returned from here","Stalker"
"239",2599829,2601873,"and got rich overnight.","Stalker"
"240",2603916,2605543,"Fabulously rich.","Stalker"
"241",2605751,2607460,"You call it punishment?","Stalker"
"242",2609380,2611632,"A week later he hanged himself.","Stalker"
"243",2612507,2613509,"Why?","Stalker"
"244",2614342,2615344,"Quiet!","Stalker"
"245",2618597,2620391,"What was that?","Stalker"
"246",2736340,2740927,"Presumably a meteorite fell downhere about twenty years ago.","Stalker"
"247",2742679,2744472,"It had burned down the settlement.","Stalker"
"248",2746057,2749936,"They searched for this meteorite,but never found it, of course.","Stalker"
"249",2751731,2754065,"Why ''of course''?","Stalker"
"250",2754692,2756985,"Then people began disappearing here.","Stalker"
"251",2758403,2760655,"They came here and never returned.","Stalker"
"252",2763201,2764994,"So it was concluded...","Stalker"
"253",2766161,2770541,"that this meteoritewas not really a meteorite.","Stalker"
"254",2771708,2773126,"At first...","Stalker"
"255",2776047,2781302,"they circled the place with barbedwire to scare off the inquisitive.","Stalker"
"256",2784554,2789226,"All this gave rise to rumoursthat there's a place in the Zone...","Stalker"
"257",2792563,2794398,"where wishes come true.","Stalker"
"258",2795273,2801572,"Naturally, they began to guardthe Zone like the apple of their eye.","Stalker"
"259",2803699,2807286,"Who knows what kind of wishsomeone might cherish.","Stalker"
"260",2808036,2811289,"What was it if not a meteorite?","Stalker"
"261",2814876,2816420,"I told you, no one knows.","Stalker"
"262",2818130,2820423,"And what do you think?","Stalker"
"263",2822385,2825637,"Nothing.Or anything.","Stalker"
"264",2828431,2831893,"A message to mankind,as one of my colleagues says.","Stalker"
"265",2832728,2834146,"Or a gift.","Stalker"
"266",2839318,2841027,"Some gift.","Stalker"
"267",2842530,2844489,"Why on earth would they do it?","Stalker"
"268",2844699,2846409,"To make us happy.","Stalker"
"269",2851038,2855083,"The flowers are blooming again,but they don't smell for some reason.","Stalker"
"270",2856251,2861257,"Sorry for leaving you two here,but it was too early to go anyway.","Stalker"
"271",2865927,2866929,"Did you hear it?","Stalker"
"272",2868431,2870474,"Maybe someone lives here?","Stalker"
"273",2871976,2872976,"Who?","Stalker"
"274",2875353,2877606,"You told me yourself","Stalker"
"275",2877815,2882527,"about some tourists camped herewhen the Zone originated.","Stalker"
"276",2883445,2885739,"There's no one in the Zone andthere can't be.","Stalker"
"277",2890994,2892454,"Well, it's time.","Stalker"
"278",2939918,2941545,"How are we going to return?","Stalker"
"279",2942630,2946050,"- They don't return here.- What do you mean?","Stalker"
"280",2947385,2949512,"We'll go as we agreed.","Stalker"
"281",2955559,2957603,"I'll show the direction.","Stalker"
"282",2958271,2960313,"Any deviation from it is dangerous.","Stalker"
"283",2963025,2965235,"The first landmark is that last pole.","Stalker"
"284",2966612,2969574,"You go first, Professor.","Stalker"
"285",2982335,2983336,"Now you.","Stalker"
"286",2991971,2994014,"Try to follow in his footsteps.","Stalker"
"287",3073385,3076054,"Oh, my God! And where are...","Stalker"
"288",3076764,3080893,"Did they remain here like that?Those people?","Stalker"
"289",3081476,3082728,"Who knows.","Stalker"
"290",3084146,3089485,"I remember them packing at the station,getting ready to come here.","Stalker"
"291",3090318,3091945,"I was just a boy.","Stalker"
"292",3092947,3096867,"We all thought thenthat somebody wanted to conquer us.","Stalker"
"293",3103875,3105418,"You first, Professor.","Stalker"
"294",3114302,3115302,"Now you, Writer.","Stalker"
"295",3265452,3270248,"Your room is over there.We'll go this way.","Stalker"
"296",3271791,3275922,"Why were you hiking up the price?It's so close at hand.","Stalker"
"297",3277672,3280675,"Yes, but the handhas to be very long.","Stalker"
"298",3282637,3284304,"We don't have such a hand.","Stalker"
"299",3351873,3353416,"Don't! Leave it alone!","Stalker"
"300",3355293,3357420,"Don't touch it!","Stalker"
"301",3360505,3362757,"Don't touch it, I said!","Stalker"
"302",3362925,3366971,"Are you crazy?What's the matter with you?","Stalker"
"303",3369556,3371684,"It's not the placefor leisurely strolls.","Stalker"
"304",3373518,3375896,"The Zone wants to be respected.Otherwise it will punish.","Stalker"
"305",3376146,3381318,"Don't you ever try it again...Have you no tongue or what?","Stalker"
"306",3383695,3384780,"I warned you, didn't I?","Stalker"
"307",3385614,3386615,"Are we to go there?","Stalker"

"309",3392538,3397293,"Only we are not going this way.We'll go around.","Stalker"
"310",3398710,3399920,"Why?","Stalker"
"311",3401588,3402965,"People don't go this way.","Stalker"
"312",3403340,3407177,"In the Zone, the longer the way,the less is the risk.","Stalker"
"313",3408387,3410347,"And to go straight ahead is fatal?","Stalker"
"314",3410556,3412141,"He told you it's dangerous.","Stalker"
"315",3412349,3415978,"- And making a detour's not dangerous?- It is. But they don't go this way.","Stalker"
"316",3416186,3419273,"What do I care that they don't?What if I take a chance...","Stalker"
"317",3419481,3421025,"Listen, what's the matter with you...","Stalker"
"318",3421233,3424570,"To go all the way around!When everything's so close.","Stalker"
"319",3425153,3428407,"Here a risk, there a risk.What the hell !","Stalker"
"320",3428615,3431869,"You're being very flippantabout this.","Stalker"

"348",3694340,3696967,"You're smart, Mister Shakespeare.","Stalker"
"349",3697467,3700429,"To go straight ahead is scary,to go back is embarrassing.","Stalker"
"350",3700596,3705934,"So you gave yourseIf a command.Fear has made you come to your senses.","Stalker"
"351",3706768,3708353,"- What?- Stop it.","Stalker"
"352",3708938,3712108,"- Why have you emptied the bottle?- Stop it, I said!","Stalker"
"353",3728291,3732545,"The Zone is a very complicated system...","Stalker"
"354",3735590,3739135,"...of traps,and they're all deadly.","Stalker"
"355",3742221,3744931,"I don't know what's going on herein the absence of people,","Stalker"

"360",3772210,3773543,"That's the Zone.","Stalker"
"361",3775213,3778507,"It may even seem capricious.","Stalker"
"362",3780175,3783971,"But it is what we've made itwith our condition.","Stalker"
"363",3787224,3792480,"It happened that peoplehad to stop halfway, and go back.","Stalker"
"364",3794190,3797360,"Some of them even diedon the very threshold of the room.","Stalker"
"365",3798860,3802072,"But everything that's going on heredepends not on the Zone, but on us!","Stalker"
"366",3802447,3805867,"So it lets the good ones passand kills the bad ones?","Stalker"
"367",3807286,3808996,"I don't know.","Stalker"
"368",3809204,3811581,"I think,it lets those pass who...","Stalker"
"369",3812583,3814626,"have lost all hope.","Stalker"
"370",3815126,3819090,"Not good or bad,but wretched people.","Stalker"
"371",3820590,3824427,"But even the most wretched will dieif they don't know how to behave.","Stalker"

"378",3860547,3863634,"Besides, one doesn't return herethe way one comes.","Stalker"
"379",3866137,3868097,"Anyway, I would prefer...","Stalker"
"380",3868306,3870599,"Then we're going back right away.","Stalker"
"381",3871434,3875396,"I'll return your moneyminus a certain sum","Stalker"

"393",4019581,4022460,"And let them have a laughat their passions.","Stalker"
"394",4023293,4027380,"Because what they call passionactually is not some emotional energy,","Stalker"

"432",4355417,4358546,"- What?- Professor has disappeared!","Stalker"
"433",4358796,4363091,"How could it happen?He was following you all the way.","Stalker"
"434",4364010,4367305,"He probably lagged behind andlost his way.","Stalker"

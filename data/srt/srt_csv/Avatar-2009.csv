"1297",8372405,8374906,"Everyone on this base, every one of you,","Avatar"
"1298",8374990,8376825,"is fighting for survival.","Avatar"
"1299",8376908,8378409,"That's a fact!","Avatar"
"1300",8379245,8382997,"There's an aboriginal horde out theremassing for an attack.","Avatar"
"1301",8384083,8387960,"Now, these orbital images tell me","Avatar"
"1302",8388379,8391630,"that the hostiles' numbershave gone from a few hundred","Avatar"
"1303",8391631,8394217,"to well over 2,000 in one day.","Avatar"
"1304",8394761,8396762,"And more are pouring in.","Avatar"
"1305",8399222,8402641,"In a week's time,there could be 20,000 of them.","Avatar"
"1306",8402727,8405102,"At that point,they will overrun our perimeter.","Avatar"
"1307",8405103,8407355,"Well, that's not gonna happen!","Avatar"
"1308",8408941,8412611,"Our only security liesin pre-emptive attack.","Avatar"
"1309",8412611,8415030,"We will fight terror with terror.","Avatar"
"1310",8419326,8423496,"Now, the hostiles believethat this mountain stronghold of theirs","Avatar"
"1311",8423581,8425998,"is protected by their...","Avatar"
"1312",8426000,8427416,"Their deity.","Avatar"
"1313",8428710,8430836,"And when we destroy it,","Avatar"
"1314",8430837,8433215,"we will blast a craterin their racial memory so deep","Avatar"
"1315",8433299,8436801,"that they won't comewithin 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.","Avatar"
"1316",8436886,8439595,"And that, too, is a fact.","Avatar"
"1317",8440306,8442057,"Yeah! Yeah.","Avatar"
"1318",8452527,8456487,"Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.","Avatar"
"1319",8456572,8458824,"They've got these huge palletsof mine explosives.","Avatar"
"1320",8458907,8461826,"It's for some kindof shock-and-awe campaign.","Avatar"
"1321",8461911,8463828,"Fricking daisy cutters!","Avatar"
"1322",8465331,8468165,"Quaritch has taken over.He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.","Avatar"

"1324",8470420,8472295,"- Max! Max!- I gotta go.","Avatar"
"1325",8474173,8475674,"We're screwed!","Avatar"
"1326",8477135,8479386,"And I was hopingfor some sort of tactical plan","Avatar"
"1327",8479387,8481638,"that didn't involve martyrdom.","Avatar"
"1328",8483099,8486476,"We're going up against gunshipswith bows and arrows.","Avatar"
"1329",8489479,8491522,"I have 15 clans out there.","Avatar"
"1330",8492191,8494316,"That's over 2,000 warriors.","Avatar"
"1331",8495819,8500281,"Now, we know these mountains.We fly them. You fly them. They don't.","Avatar"
"1332",8501325,8505370,"Their instruments won't work up here.Missile tracking won't work.","Avatar"
"1333",8505871,8507371,"They'll have to fire a line of sight.","Avatar"
"1334",8507457,8511709,"If they bring the fight to us,then we have the home-field advantage.","Avatar"
"1335",8513587,8517048,"You know he's gonna commit that bomberstraight to the Tree of Souls.","Avatar"
"1336",8517132,8518382,"Yeah, I know.","Avatar"
"1337",8518384,8520926,"If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.","Avatar"
"1338",8521012,8524221,"That's their direct line to Eywa,their ancestors.","Avatar"
"1339",8525015,8527058,"It'll destroy them.","Avatar"
"1340",8527058,8529519,"Then I guess we'd better stop him.","Avatar"
"1341",8544576,8547578,"I'm probably just talkingto a tree right now.","Avatar"
"1342",8549998,8554753,"But if you're there,I need to give you a heads-up.","Avatar"
"1343",8557298,8561718,"If Grace is with you,look into her memories.","Avatar"
"1344",8562969,8565095,"See the world we come from.","Avatar"
"1345",8566182,8568099,"There's no green there.","Avatar"
"1346",8569477,8571477,"They killed their Mother.","Avatar"
"1347",8572271,8574772,"And they're gonna do the same here.","Avatar"
"1348",8576399,8578985,"More Sky People are gonna come.","Avatar"
"1349",8579069,8582112,"They're gonna comelike a rain that never ends.","Avatar"
"1350",8583406,8585157,"Unless we stop them.","Avatar"
"1351",8587745,8590829,"Look, you chose me for something.","Avatar"
"1352",8592290,8594166,"I will stand and fight.","Avatar"
"1353",8595210,8596795,"You know I will.","Avatar"
"1354",8599298,8601549,"But I need a little help here.","Avatar"

"836",4152957,4155336,"How's Brian doing?","Backdraft"
"837",4155418,4160341,"- He's out. He quit.- He just up and quit for no reason?","Backdraft"

"839",4163219,4165679,"than any other probie I ever had.All right?","Backdraft"
"840",4165762,4167847,"He probablyhates my guts...","Backdraft"
"841",4167931,4170434,"but at least he finallytook a look in the mirror.","Backdraft"
"842",4170518,4173479,"So once again, Stephen's rightand somebody else is wrong.","Backdraft"
"843",4173561,4175480,"You always gotta be right.","Backdraft"
"844",4175564,4177942,"- That's such bullshit.- Yeah? Why?","Backdraft"
"845",4177983,4181153,"Because I'm the firstto admit it when I'm wrong.","Backdraft"
"846",4181237,4183154,"Yeah?How often does that happen?","Backdraft"
"847",4183238,4185282,"In a fire? Never!","Backdraft"
"848",4188077,4190621,"He would havebought it, Helen.","Backdraft"

"862",4237167,4239502,"Torchers want to frythe whole goddamn world.","Backdraft"
"863",4239587,4243006,"But the fires that killed those guysnever burned up that much.","Backdraft"
"864",4243090,4246801,"The trychtichlorate hid the magnesiumin the plug, but it burned slow.","Backdraft"
"865",4246844,4248970,"And he madehis burns backdrafts.","Backdraft"
"866",4249012,4252640,"- But he killed these guys.- Could have killed everybody.","Backdraft"
"867",4252682,4255895,"Backdraft blew out the flame.That's it. That's the reason.","Backdraft"

"871",4265070,4267363,"They also made sure thatthe fire blew itself out.","Backdraft"
"872",4267405,4270033,"So that's why they usedthe putty in the doors.","Backdraft"
"873",4271243,4273203,"What do we got?A torch with a conscience?","Backdraft"
"874",4273244,4277248,"No. We got a stone killertrying to make a point.","Backdraft"

"196",790720,794322,"Yeah, one, but she kept walking mepast furniture windows...","Laura"
"197",794422,797824,"to look at the parlor suites.","Laura"
"198",797824,800626,"- Would you mind turning that off?- Why? Don't you like it?","Laura"
"199",800626,804430,"It was one of Laura's favorites.Not exactly classical, but sweet.","Laura"

"206",821841,824543,"I'd been working on thatadvertising campaign with Laura.","Laura"
"207",824543,827945,"Well, we'd been working so hard, I--I just couldn't keep my eyes open.","Laura"
"208",827945,830647,"I didn't hear a note at the concert.I fell asleep.","Laura"
"209",830647,833649,"Next he'll producephotographic evidence of his dreams.","Laura"
"210",833649,836751,"I know it sounds suspicious,but I'm resigned to that by now.","Laura"
"211",836751,840454,"I'm a natural-born suspect just becauseI'm not the conventional type.","Laura"
"212",840454,842654,"I wouldn't worry about it,Mr. Carpenter.","Laura"
"213",842755,846358,"It sounds reasonable.I fall asleep at concerts myself.","Laura"

"225",884083,886886,"- Oh. - I have private reasonsthat don't concern him.","Laura"
"226",886886,889089,"Everything about Lauraconcerns me.","Laura"
"227",889089,893090,"You have private reasons,no doubt, to lie about the key.","Laura"

"234",908001,910503,"Will you please stop dawdlingwith that infernal puzzle?","Laura"
"235",910602,914906,"- It's getting on my nerves.- I know, but it keeps me calm.","Laura"
"236",914906,917007,"Okay, let's go.","Laura"
"237",932518,934720,"This was our table--","Laura"
"238",934819,936822,"Laura's and mine.","Laura"
"239",938222,940724,"We spent many quiet eveningshere together.","Laura"
"240",942925,946528,"I remember we dined here the nightbefore her 22nd birthday.","Laura"
"241",947128,949230,"Just we two--","Laura"
"242",949230,953432,"happy, making plansfor her future.","Laura"
"243",954434,957436,"- Good luck.But this was a far cry...","Laura"
"244",957436,962539,"from the girl who walked into my lifeat the Algonquin Hotel five years before.","Laura"
"245",963440,965741,"Pardon me.Excuse me.","Laura"
"246",968044,970045,"Excuse me.","Laura"
"247",979050,982053,"Mr. Lydecker,how do you do?","Laura"
"248",982252,985755,"My name is Laura Hunt,and I'm with Bullitt and Company.","Laura"
"249",985855,988156,"You know,the big advertising firm.","Laura"
"250",988258,991160,"And I'd like to talksomething over with you, if I may.","Laura"
"251",991259,995563,"You can hardly fail to realize thatI am engaged in eating my lunch.","Laura"
"252",995563,999466,"Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorryto interrupt this way...","Laura"
"253",999466,1002568,"but it's so hard to get to see youthe regular way, and...","Laura"
"254",1002668,1004969,"this will onlytake a minute, really.","Laura"
"255",1007670,1009673,"- Now, this is--- Young woman...","Laura"
"256",1009673,1013674,"either you have been raisedin some incredibly rustic community...","Laura"
"257",1013674,1016276,"where good mannersare unknown...","Laura"
"258",1016276,1018779,"or you suffer from the commonfeminine delusion...","Laura"
"259",1018678,1020779,"that the mere factof being a woman...","Laura"
"260",1020779,1024283,"exempts you from the rulesof civilized conduct.","Laura"
"261",1024784,1026885,"Or possibly both.","Laura"
"262",1026885,1029687,"Possibly, but here'swhat I wanted to show you.","Laura"
"263",1029687,1031688,"It's forthe Wallace Flow-Rite pen.","Laura"
"264",1031688,1036090,"I know my company would be glad to payyou $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.","Laura"
"265",1036090,1038093,"I don't use a pen.","Laura"
"266",1038093,1040293,"I write with a goose quilldipped in venom.","Laura"
"267",1040293,1043296,"Yes, but this is a very fine pen,Mr. Lydecker...","Laura"
"268",1043395,1045297,"the best on the market.","Laura"
"269",1045397,1047998,"Wouldn't you at leastconsider endorsing it?","Laura"
"270",1048098,1052402,"I'll neither consider, endorseor use the Wallace pen.","Laura"
"271",1052501,1054904,"I hate pens.","Laura"
"272",1054904,1058307,"If your employers wish me to publishthat statement in my column...","Laura"
"273",1058307,1061108,"you may tell them that I shall bedelighted to oblige.","Laura"
"274",1061108,1065211,"Oh, no.You mustn't do that.","Laura"
"275",1065211,1067612,"Don't blame Bullitt and Company,Mr. Lydecker.","Laura"
"276",1067612,1071515,"They don't know anything about this.It was my idea to see you.","Laura"
"277",1072516,1074317,"Indeed?","Laura"
"278",1074317,1078721,"Yes. I know they'd give anything downat the office to get your endorsement...","Laura"
"279",1078721,1081322,"only they thinkthere's no use asking.","Laura"
"280",1081322,1084325,"So I had this ad made upall on my own...","Laura"
"281",1084325,1088127,"because I thought, well,what's the harm in trying?","Laura"
"282",1088127,1090728,"There was always a chancethat you might, Mr. Lydecker.","Laura"
"283",1090728,1092530,"Just think whatit would mean--","Laura"
"284",1092530,1097033,"You seem to be completely disregardingsomething more important than your career.","Laura"
"285",1097033,1099235,"- What?- My lunch.","Laura"
"286",1101336,1103438,"Do you really believe that?","Laura"
"287",1103638,1106040,"Implicitly.","Laura"
"288",1106139,1108641,"I never heardof anything so selfish.","Laura"
"289",1108741,1113444,"In my case, self-absorptionis completely justified.","Laura"
"290",1113444,1117147,"I have never discovered any othersubject quite so worthy of my attention.","Laura"
"291",1117147,1119749,"But you write about people...","Laura"
"292",1119749,1123350,"with such real understandingand sentiment.","Laura"
"293",1124452,1126752,"That's what makesyour column so good.","Laura"
"294",1126752,1130356,"Sentiment comes easilyat 50 cents a word.","Laura"
"295",1131658,1133859,"Well, if that's the wayyou really feel...","Laura"
"296",1134960,1137963,"you must be very lonely.","Laura"
"297",1138162,1142065,"Will you kindly continuethis character analysis elsewhere?","Laura"
"298",1142166,1145466,"- You begin to bore me.- You're a poor man.","Laura"
"299",1145466,1147669,"I'm very sorry for you.","Laura"
"300",1150270,1152972,"Naturally,I was annoyed by the incident...","Laura"
"301",1154273,1156574,"but she had somethingabout her, that girl.","Laura"
"302",1157776,1161878,"I had to speak to her again.I had to see her.","Laura"
"303",1161979,1164281,"- Miss, would you mind if I--- Just a moment, please.","Laura"
"304",1164380,1166782,"I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.He's on the telephone.","Laura"

"309",1205509,1209211,"Miss Hunt, I have somethingto say to you.","Laura"
"310",1209312,1211713,"You've already said it,Mr. Lydecker.","Laura"
"311",1211913,1215515,"I wish to point out that you caught meat my most difficult moment.","Laura"
"312",1215616,1218317,"Ordinarily I am notwithout a heart.","Laura"
"313",1218418,1220319,"Really?","Laura"
"314",1220419,1223621,"Shall I produceX-ray pictures to prove it?","Laura"
"315",1226223,1228524,"I wish to apologize.","Laura"
"316",1228625,1230625,"Your apology is accepted.","Laura"
"317",1233029,1234930,"Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.","Laura"
"318",1235029,1237231,"If you comea little bit closer, my boy...","Laura"
"319",1237331,1239834,"I can just crack your skullwith my stick.","Laura"
"320",1243936,1247538,"And now, for reasonswhich are too embarrassing to mention...","Laura"
"321",1248338,1251140,"I'd like to endorse that pen.","Laura"
"322",1251241,1253342,"Mr. Lydecker!","Laura"
"323",1253442,1255444,"Thank you.","Laura"
"324",1257945,1261047,"- You're a very strange man.- What?","Laura"
"325",1261148,1265150,"You're really sorryfor the way you acted, aren't you?","Laura"
"326",1265150,1267853,"Let's not be psychiatric,Miss Hunt...","Laura"
"327",1267853,1271255,"but in a word, yes.","Laura"
"328",1272155,1274057,"It's very kind of you,you know.","Laura"
"329",1274158,1277959,"I'm not kind. I'm vicious.It's the secret of my charm.","Laura"
"330",1280361,1283063,"But if you chooseto think me kind...","Laura"
"331",1283664,1286565,"I'll call for you at 6:00.","Laura"
"332",1287266,1289868,"All right?","Laura"
"333",1289968,1292069,"All right.","Laura"
"334",1295572,1298573,"Her career beganwith my endorsement of the pen.","Laura"
"335",1298674,1301777,"I secured other endorsements for her...","Laura"
"336",1301976,1303978,"introduced herto important clients.","Laura"
"337",1305579,1307880,"I gave her her start...","Laura"
"338",1307980,1310082,"but it was her own talentand imagination...","Laura"
"339",1310182,1312684,"that enabled her to riseto the top of her profession...","Laura"
"340",1312684,1315186,"and stay there.","Laura"
"341",1316086,1319388,"She had an eager mind always.","Laura"
"342",1319488,1323191,"She was always quick to seize uponanything that would improve her mind...","Laura"
"343",1323291,1325492,"or her appearance.","Laura"
"344",1326493,1328895,"Laura had innate breeding.","Laura"
"345",1333598,1337202,"But she deferredto my judgment and taste.","Laura"
"346",1337602,1341504,"I selected a more attractivehairdress for her.","Laura"
"347",1343506,1346908,"I taught her what clotheswere more becoming to her.","Laura"
"348",1348709,1351511,"Through me, she met everyone.","Laura"
"349",1351611,1354312,"The famous and the infamous.","Laura"
"350",1354312,1358616,"Her youth and beauty, her poiseand charm of manner...","Laura"
"351",1358816,1360917,"captivated them all.","Laura"
"352",1361017,1364419,"She had warmth, vitality.","Laura"
"353",1364620,1367021,"She had authentic magnetism.","Laura"
"354",1368522,1371826,"Wherever we went,she stood out.","Laura"
"355",1372025,1375828,"Men admired her.Women envied her.","Laura"
"356",1376028,1380031,"She became as well knownas Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...","Laura"
"357",1380131,1382432,"and his white carnation.","Laura"
"358",1382532,1385734,"But Tuesday and Friday nightswe stayed home...","Laura"
"359",1385834,1389237,"dining quietly,listening to my records.","Laura"
"360",1390237,1393240,"I read my articles to her.","Laura"
"361",1393340,1397343,"The way she listenedwas more eloquent than speech.","Laura"
"362",1399043,1400845,"These were the best nights.","Laura"
"363",1402346,1405950,"Then one Tuesday, she phonedand said she couldn't come.","Laura"
"364",1406951,1409452,"It didn't matter, really.","Laura"
"365",1409452,1413455,"But when it happened againthe following Friday, I was disturbed.","Laura"
"366",1415356,1419358,"I couldn'tunderstand it. I felt betrayed...","Laura"
"367",1420158,1423761,"and yet I knew Laurawould never betray anyone.","Laura"
"368",1429665,1432467,"I walked for a long time.","Laura"
"369",1433768,1437471,"Then I found myselfbefore her apartment building.","Laura"
"370",1437471,1442375,"The lights were on.It pleased me to know she was home...","Laura"
"371",1442375,1444676,"till I saw she was not alone.","Laura"
"372",1446477,1450781,"But I waited.I wanted to see who he was.","Laura"
"373",1455684,1459386,"It was Jacoby, who had recentlypainted her portrait.","Laura"
"374",1459686,1462087,"I never liked the man.","Laura"
"375",1462087,1467092,"He was so obviously conscious of lookingmore like an athlete than an artist.","Laura"
"376",1467092,1470593,"I sat up the rest of the nightwriting a column about him.","Laura"
"377",1470593,1472095,"I demolished his affectations...","Laura"
"378",1472095,1475397,"exposed his camouflagedimitations of better painters...","Laura"
"379",1475498,1478199,"ridiculed his theories.","Laura"
"380",1478199,1482303,"I did it for her,knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.","Laura"
"381",1482303,1485905,"It was a masterpiecebecause it was a labor of love.","Laura"
"382",1485905,1489507,"Naturally, she could neverregard him seriously again.","Laura"
"383",1490207,1493209,"There were others,of course...","Laura"
"384",1493309,1495611,"but her own discriminationruled them out...","Laura"
"385",1495611,1498812,"before it became necessaryfor me to intercede...","Laura"
"386",1500014,1503416,"until one night at a partyat Ann Treadwell's.","Laura"
"387",1503516,1507919,"It was one of her usual roundupsof bizarre and nondescript characters...","Laura"
"388",1507919,1510122,"- corralled from every stratum of society.- How are you this evening?","Laura"
"389",1510122,1512523,"This is Mr. and Mrs. Preston.They've been waiting to meet you.","Laura"

"403",1559256,1562458,"Louise. Louise, for the last time,will you marry me?","Laura"
"404",1562458,1565260,"I won't, but I've savedsome chicken livers for you.","Laura"

"406",1567161,1569362,"you think you couldget this spot out for me?","Laura"
"407",1569362,1572265,"I can afford a blemish on my characterbut not on my clothes.","Laura"
"408",1572265,1574865,"- Mmm. Couldn't eat another mouthful.- I'm afraid it's rouge.","Laura"
"409",1574865,1577068,"- I'm afraid it's liquor.- Louise. Oh.","Laura"
"410",1577068,1580372,"- May I have a glass of milk for Mr. Lydecker?- Of course, Miss Hunt.","Laura"
"411",1580372,1582473,"I forgot to tell you.I also read palms.","Laura"

"413",1586575,1588477,"What more can you wantof a man?","Laura"
"414",1588477,1591579,"- Don't listen to that scalawag.- I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.","Laura"
"415",1591579,1593380,"What do you mean?We're old friends.","Laura"
"416",1593380,1595181,"She feeds me,humors me, repairs me...","Laura"
"417",1595181,1597282,"and refuses to marry me,don't you, honey?","Laura"
"418",1597282,1599284,"- I do.- She has good sense.","Laura"
"419",1599284,1602286,"- Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.- You're wasting your time.","Laura"

"426",1621199,1623401,"Why maintain the fiction?Why not work?","Laura"
"427",1623401,1627004,"Believe it or not, I askedone of my many friends for a job once--","Laura"

"429",1629705,1632707,"He could have pressed a buttonand done it, but he just laughed.","Laura"
"430",1632707,1634708,"- He thought I was joking.- Weren't you?","Laura"
"431",1634708,1637710,"No. When I convinced him, he gotembarrassed, said he'd phone me.","Laura"
"432",1637710,1643314,"That was months ago. Now wheneverhe sees me, he looks the other way.","Laura"

"502",1883682,1887184,"I don't believe it. He probably neededmoney and was too proud to borrow.","Laura"
"503",1887184,1889186,"Carpenter proud?","Laura"
"504",1890186,1892890,"Perhaps that's whythe pawn ticket was in her name.","Laura"

"822",3377525,3381027,"- Does she know how?- I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.","Laura"

"825",3387132,3389934,"You haven't borrowed it lately?You didn't just bring it back tonight?","Laura"
"826",3389934,3393937,"You followed me here.You saw me come in. You ought to know.","Laura"

"830",3404143,3407445,"Didn't you know Laura Hunt would comeback any day and spill the whole thing?","Laura"

"842",3443971,3445973,"- Well, I--- You had a key, and I know it.","Laura"
"843",3446072,3448473,"- Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.- I--","Laura"
"844",3448574,3452978,"Laura kept a duplicate keyat her office. I went over and got it.","Laura"
"845",3453077,3457182,"I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wantedto have it out with her once and for all.","Laura"
"846",3457281,3461783,"You know, she thought-- Well,she thought she was in love with me.","Laura"
"847",3461884,3465086,"Well, we couldn't go on talkingin public places. She was too upset.","Laura"
"848",3465286,3467788,"I couldn't go to her room, and I didn'twant to take her to my hotel.","Laura"
"849",3467788,3470589,"- So we went to Laura's.- Yeah?","Laura"
"850",3470589,3472492,"We talked therefor about three hours...","Laura"
"851",3472592,3475994,"- and then the doorbell rang and--- Go on.","Laura"
"852",3476094,3478896,"Diane was frightened.But knowing Laura as I've known her...","Laura"
"853",3478896,3480997,"I've learned to besurprised at nothing.","Laura"
"854",3480997,3484500,"- What do you mean by that? - Her friendswould come to her with their troubles...","Laura"
"855",3484500,3486901,"at all hoursof the day or night.","Laura"
"856",3486901,3489404,"I asked Dianeto answer the door.","Laura"
"857",3489404,3493406,"- Why didn't you go yourself? - Supposingone of Laura's friends had found me there.","Laura"
"858",3493406,3496107,"- Why open the door at all?- They must have seen the light.","Laura"
"859",3496107,3498909,"What about the girl? Diane--what about her reputation?","Laura"
"860",3498909,3502812,"I asked her to tell them Laura had lether the apartment while she was away.","Laura"
"861",3502812,3505013,"Anybody that knew Laurawould have believed that.","Laura"
"862",3505013,3508416,"- Yeah. Go on.- Well, then the doorbell rang again.","Laura"
"863",3508516,3511318,"I could hear Diane's mules--Laura's they were--","Laura"
"864",3511318,3514319,"clattering across the bare boardsbetween the rugs.","Laura"
"865",3514420,3517522,"Then there was a moment's silenceand then a shot.","Laura"
"866",3518123,3520824,"It was an awful explosion.","Laura"
"867",3520925,3523927,"By the time I reached her,the door was closed.","Laura"
"868",3524028,3527129,"- She lay there on the floor.- Did you go out to see who it was?","Laura"
"869",3527129,3530531,"No. I was too confused, too horrified,incapable of doing anything.","Laura"
"870",3530531,3533633,"The room was dark. I saw onlya vague heap lying on the floor.","Laura"
"871",3533633,3537937,"I-- I don't thinkI fully grasped the situation.","Laura"
"872",3537937,3541039,"I think I called her name,but I'm not sure. I--","Laura"
"873",3541139,3544742,"I remember kneeling on the floor,feeling her heart.","Laura"
"874",3545942,3547943,"My first instinctwas to call the police.","Laura"
"875",3548044,3549945,"- Why didn't you?- I don't know.","Laura"
"876",3550145,3553347,"Or rather, I was afraid--not only for myself, but for Laura.","Laura"
"877",3553347,3557851,"In a panicky sort of way, I felt I mustkeep out of this to keep Laura out of it.","Laura"
"878",3557851,3560253,"I know now how foolishand hopeless it was...","Laura"
"879",3560253,3562955,"but there was onlyone thing on my mind--","Laura"
"880",3562955,3565856,"the safety of a person whose lifewas dearer to me than my own.","Laura"
"881",3565856,3567758,"Don't you understand that?","Laura"
"882",3567758,3570260,"Did you thinkLaura had done it?","Laura"
"883",3570260,3573161,"- Did you?- I don't remember what I thought.","Laura"
"884",3573161,3576164,"- Do you think so now?- No.","Laura"
"885",3576164,3578365,"- But you didn't?- No.","Laura"
"886",3578365,3581667,"On Saturday, when our men went to thehotel to tell you that Laura was dead...","Laura"

"1104",4369717,4374020,"Thanks. No, I didn'tkill Diane Redfern...","Laura"
"1105",4374020,4376221,"or anyone else.","Laura"
"1106",4377522,4379925,"Then why--","Laura"
"1107",4380024,4383327,"Why did you tell me the radioat your country place was broken?","Laura"
"1108",4383327,4385628,"- Because it was broken.- Not when I tried it.","Laura"
"1109",4385728,4388830,"Just as I was leaving the village,I asked the local handyman to fix it.","Laura"
"1110",4388830,4392834,"- How did he get in? - I always leave akey under the flowerpot on the porch.","Laura"
"1111",4392834,4397836,"You're too intelligent to make upsomething I could check so easily...","Laura"
"1112",4397836,4402841,"but you're intelligent enough to havebroken it yourself to strengthen your story.","Laura"
"1113",4402841,4406844,"The main thing I want to know is why youpulled that switch on me about Carpenter.","Laura"
"1114",4406844,4410446,"You told me last nightyou decided not to marry him.","Laura"
"1115",4410446,4414949,"- Yes, I guess I did.- But today it was on again. Why?","Laura"
"1116",4414949,4418852,"Well, I--I changed my mind.","Laura"
"1117",4418852,4423854,"What are you trying to hide? Don't yourealize you're involved in a murder?","Laura"
"1118",4423854,4427358,"You've got yourself in a jam it's notgoing to be easy to get out of...","Laura"
"1119",4427358,4429159,"unless you're on the levelwith me.","Laura"
"1120",4429159,4431661,"This is no time for secrets.","Laura"
"1121",4431661,4433762,"Now, did you really decideto call it off...","Laura"
"1122",4433762,4437865,"or did you just tell me that becauseyou knew I wanted to hear it?","Laura"
"1123",4441568,4444970,"What went on between you and Carpenterwhen you saw him last night?","Laura"
"1124",4444970,4447873,"Did he persuade you to make up?","Laura"
"1125",4448272,4450774,"Or did you agreeto pretend you had?","Laura"
"1126",4450774,4454275,"- Was that it?- Well, we-- That is, both of us thought--","Laura"
"1127",4454275,4457379,"He convinced you that if youbroke the engagement now...","Laura"
"1128",4457379,4459980,"people would thinkyou believed he was guilty.","Laura"
"1129",4459980,4463383,"Yes, but now I know it was onlybecause he thought I was.","Laura"
"1130",4463383,4466386,"- Did you believe he was guilty?- No. I'm sure he isn't.","Laura"
"1131",4466386,4469488,"But he'd gotten himselfinto an awfully suspicious position...","Laura"
"1132",4469488,4473589,"and he's the sort of man that people arealways ready to believe the worst about.","Laura"
"1133",4474290,4476492,"Are you in love with him?","Laura"
"1134",4480795,4483297,"I don't see howI ever could have been.","Laura"
"1135",4487500,4489601,"Come on.You're going home.","Laura"
"1136",4491903,4495405,"- But I thought I was--- That's-- That's what I wanted you to think.","Laura"
"1137",4495405,4498708,"You and a few others.I didn't even book you.","Laura"
"1138",4498708,4501010,"You mean this wassome sort of a game?","Laura"
"1139",4501010,4503912,"I was 99% certainabout you...","Laura"
"1140",4503912,4506313,"but I had to get rid ofthat one percent doubt.","Laura"
"1141",4506313,4509515,"Wasn't therean easier way to make sure?","Laura"
"1142",4509515,4513418,"I'd... reached a pointwhere I needed official surroundings.","Laura"
"1143",4515619,4518221,"Then it was worth it, Mark.","Laura"
"1144",4520622,4522624,"I'll call a cab for you.","Laura"
"1145",4535934,4538035,"Good night.I'll see you tomorrow.","Laura"
"1146",4538135,4540136,"Good night, Mark.","Laura"
"1147",4541338,4543338,"I'm going overto Lydecker's apartment.","Laura"
"1148",4626597,4628698,"It still doesn'tmake sense to me, Laura.","Laura"
"1149",4628698,4631400,"He's playing some sortof a game with you.","Laura"
"1150",4631400,4634402,"- I don't think so.- I don't deny that he's infatuated with you...","Laura"
"1151",4634402,4637604,"in some warped wayof his own.","Laura"
"1152",4637705,4641807,"But he isn't capable of any normal,warm human relationship.","Laura"
"1153",4641807,4644509,"He's been dealingwith criminals too long.","Laura"
"1154",4646811,4649413,"When you were unattainable--when he thought you were dead--","Laura"
"1155",4649413,4651314,"that's whenhe wanted you most.","Laura"
"1156",4651314,4653315,"But he was gladwhen I came back...","Laura"
"1157",4653315,4655517,"as if he werewaiting for me.","Laura"
"1158",4655517,4658919,"Do you know whathe calls women? ""Dames.""","Laura"
"1159",4658919,4662322,"A ""dame"" in Washington Heightsgot a fox fur out of him.","Laura"
"1160",4662322,4665923,"- His very words.- That doesn't mean anything.","Laura"
"1161",4665923,4668126,"He isn't like that.","Laura"
"1162",4668226,4671128,"Laura, you haveone tragic weakness.","Laura"
"1163",4671228,4674231,"With you, a lean, strong bodyis the measure of a man...","Laura"
"1164",4674431,4676332,"and you always get hurt.","Laura"
"1165",4677933,4680535,"No man is evergoing to hurt me again.","Laura"
"1166",4680635,4683537,"No one, not even you.","Laura"
"1167",4683637,4687039,"I? Hurt you?","Laura"
"1168",4687140,4689241,"Laura, look at me.","Laura"
"1169",4691542,4694844,"When a man has everythingin the world that he wants...","Laura"
"1170",4694944,4698046,"except what he wants most...","Laura"
"1171",4698146,4700547,"he loses his self-respect.","Laura"
"1172",4700647,4703551,"It makes him bitter, Laura.","Laura"
"1173",4703651,4706753,"He wants to hurt someoneas he's been hurt.","Laura"
"1174",4708354,4711957,"You were a long timein finding out about Shelby...","Laura"
"1175",4711957,4716159,"but... that's over now.","Laura"
"1176",4716159,4718962,"We'll be back together again.","Laura"
"1177",4719962,4723664,"Haven't you heard of science'snewest triumph-- the doorbell?","Laura"
"1178",4725065,4726967,"I don't like to remind her.","Laura"
"1179",4728868,4733571,"- That was the murderer's signal.- Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.","Laura"
"1180",4733671,4737674,"I thought you'd like to know. Wetested your shotgun. It isn't the one.","Laura"
"1181",4737774,4740176,"Now, that's what I calla typical move--","Laura"
"1182",4740176,4743278,"a real keyto the man's character.","Laura"
"1183",4743278,4745680,"First he tells you thathe thinks you're innocent...","Laura"
"1184",4745680,4747881,"then proceedsto check up on you.","Laura"
"1185",4747881,4750584,"When I report that I thinkshe's innocent...","Laura"
"1186",4750584,4752285,"that's my own personal opinion.","Laura"
"1187",4752285,4755087,"When I submit proof, it becomesthe opinion of the department.","Laura"
"1188",4755087,4757988,"This entire maneuver could be a trickto get you off your guard.","Laura"
"1189",4757988,4759690,"It could be, but it isn't.","Laura"
"1190",4759690,4763591,"- I believe you, Mark.- It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.","Laura"
"1191",4763591,4767094,"If McPherson weren't muscular andhandsome in a cheap sort of way...","Laura"
"1192",4767094,4769397,"you'd see through himin a second.","Laura"
"1193",4769397,4772899,"Waldo, I mean to beas kind about this as I know how...","Laura"
"1194",4772899,4777402,"but I must tell you-you're the one whofollows the same obvious pattern.","Laura"
"1195",4777402,4779904,"First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.And now I suppose--","Laura"
"1196",4779904,4782505,"- Laura, I-- - I don't thinkwe should see each other again.","Laura"
"1197",4782505,4786609,"- You're not yourself, darling.- Yes, I am.","Laura"
"1198",4786609,4790411,"For the first time in ages,I know what I'm doing.","Laura"
"1199",4792412,4794614,"Very well.","Laura"
"1200",4794715,4797817,"I hope you'll never regretwhat promises to be...","Laura"
"1201",4797817,4800418,"a disgustinglyearthy relationship.","Laura"
"1202",4801918,4804720,"My congratulations, McPherson.","Laura"
"1203",4804821,4808024,"Listen to my broadcastin 15 minutes.","Laura"
"1204",4808123,4810925,"I'm discussinggreat lovers of history.","Laura"
"1205",4830538,4835942,"- It was the most difficult thingI ever had to do in my life.","Laura"
"1206",4836042,4838445,"All I need is the gun.","Laura"
"1207",4842848,4846851,"- What are you doing?- Do you know the combination to this thing?","Laura"
"1208",4846951,4850553,"- I never knew it had one.- It must be somewhere. Oh.","Laura"
"1209",4862461,4866565,"- Have you ever seen this before?- No.","Laura"
"1210",4866764,4869466,"Waldo gave you that clock,didn't he?","Laura"
"1211",4869566,4871567,"Yes.","Laura"
"1212",4872869,4874970,"The doorbell rang...","Laura"
"1213",4875069,4878273,"and Diane Redfernwent to the door in your negligee.","Laura"
"1214",4879474,4882977,"She opened the door.The room was dark.","Laura"
"1215",4884476,4887679,"Waldo saw a girl standing there,and he assumed it was you.","Laura"
"1216",4888580,4890581,"He figured that ifhe couldn't have you himself...","Laura"
"1217",4890581,4893083,"he was gonna make surethat nobody else did.","Laura"
"1218",4893083,4894984,"So he let her have it...","Laura"
"1219",4898887,4900788,"with both barrels,right in the face.","Laura"
"1220",4902789,4905591,"She fell here.","Laura"
"1221",4905691,4908593,"Waldo heard Shelby runningfrom the next room...","Laura"
"1222",4908693,4911095,"so he hidin the stairway outside.","Laura"
"1223",4912697,4915899,"Shelby was scared,so he ran out as fast as he could.","Laura"
"1224",4915899,4919501,"Then Waldo came backand placed the gun in that clock.","Laura"
"1225",4921503,4923404,"I knew it.","Laura"
"1226",4923504,4926006,"I've felt itever since I came back...","Laura"
"1227",4926106,4928508,"but I didn't wantto believe it.","Laura"
"1228",4928607,4931409,"I couldn't make myselfbelieve that...","Laura"
"1229",4931509,4934311,"Waldo was a murderer.","Laura"
"1230",4934411,4938514,"- Well, he is.- He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.","Laura"
"1231",4938514,4940715,"- I killed her.- What are you talking about?","Laura"
"1232",4940816,4945219,"But I did, Mark. I did as surelyas if I'd pulled the trigger myself.","Laura"
"1233",4945319,4947321,"That's nonsense.Forget it.","Laura"
"1234",4947421,4951324,"No, Mark, I can't.I'm as guilty as he is--","Laura"
"1235",4951324,4955926,"not for anything I did,but for what I didn't do.","Laura"
"1236",4957027,4961431,"But I couldn't help myself.I owed him too much.","Laura"
"1237",4965833,4968735,"I can understand that,Laura...","Laura"
"1238",4968735,4972538,"but I can't understand why you've tried sohard to protect Shelby these last few days.","Laura"
"1239",4972538,4974939,"I was nearly frantic for fearyou'd arrest Shelby.","Laura"
"1240",4974939,4978041,"I knew he wasn't guilty.He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.","Laura"
"1241",4978041,4981244,"And Waldo was doing everythinghe could to incriminate him.","Laura"
"1242",4981244,4983547,"It was his wayof getting rid of Shelby...","Laura"
"1243",4983547,4985848,"just as he did Jacoby.","Laura"
"1244",4988049,4991552,"I must say, for a charming,intelligent girl...","Laura"
"1245",4991552,4994053,"you've certainly surrounded yourselfwith a remarkable collection of dopes.","Laura"
"1246",4995755,4998857,"Don't touch anything.Fingerprints will be important.","Laura"
"1247",5000857,5002960,"I'll have the clockpicked up tomorrow.","Laura"
"1248",5002960,5005061,"- What are you going to do?- Arrest Waldo.","Laura"
"1249",5005061,5007862,"- Mark.- Can't be helped.","Laura"
"1250",5014267,5016870,"That's to make sureyou're not disturbed.","Laura"
"1251",5016969,5019371,"If the doorbell rings,don't answer it.","Laura"
"1252",5019471,5023274,"- I'll phone you in the morning.- Good night, Mark.","Laura"
"1253",5023474,5026576,"Get some sleep. Forgetthe whole thing like a bad dream.","Laura"

"319",1575008,1577594,"She was no good,but couldn't tell him that.","Rio Bravo"
"320",1577678,1579971,"I tried and he damn near killed me.","Rio Bravo"

"330",1606789,1608040,"I don't know.","Rio Bravo"
"331",1608791,1611836,"So in the meantime,you have to take care of him.","Rio Bravo"
"332",1611920,1614923,"He's been doing a pretty good jobof taking care of me.","Rio Bravo"
"333",1616799,1619051,"I'm supposed to be your friend, too.","Rio Bravo"
"334",1619760,1622806,"- Why don't you let me help you?- You're not good enough.","Rio Bravo"

"609",2800192,2803737,"He was losing blood.It was dripping into a drink on the bar.","Rio Bravo"

"650",2934076,2935952,"My only excuse is...","Rio Bravo"

"663",2979204,2981164,"I'd say you made a poor sale.","Rio Bravo"
"664",2981414,2983958,"A lot of people around herewill agree with you.","Rio Bravo"
"665",2984041,2987795,"But it's still a saleand it's too late to back out.","Rio Bravo"
"666",2987878,2992092,"Not to change the subject, but how doesa girl get herself on a handbill?","Rio Bravo"
"667",2992967,2994594,"She gets married.","Rio Bravo"

"670",3003686,3005938,"It was probably my fault he cheated.","Rio Bravo"
"671",3006063,3008108,"He liked to buy me things.","Rio Bravo"
"672",3008275,3011027,"- Then why did you leave him?- I didn't.","Rio Bravo"

"780",3354871,3357248,"You could have at least let me finish.","Rio Bravo"
"781",3357916,3361753,"You try to help someonewho doesn't want any help.","Rio Bravo"
"782",3362963,3364922,"I guess I talk too much.","Rio Bravo"
"783",3367134,3368217,"You tell her?","Rio Bravo"
"784",3368302,3370594,"- Tell her what?- That she's a fool.","Rio Bravo"
"785",3372431,3373764,"She's going on the stage?","Rio Bravo"

"787",3376351,3378811,"You say she was going,why should I make sure?","Rio Bravo"
"788",3378894,3381188,"Because I say for youto make sure she does.","Rio Bravo"

"805",3455304,3457431,"Suppose we don't want to give them up?","Rio Bravo"
"806",3457556,3460351,"Think you're good enoughto take them against six of us?","Rio Bravo"
"807",3460434,3463563,"For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,that's pretty stupid.","Rio Bravo"
"808",3464106,3467608,"You won't need a gun no morebecause you'd be the first man I'd get.","Rio Bravo"
"809",3467693,3469068,"Come on, let's go.","Rio Bravo"

"812",3475742,3476909,"He cut my reins.","Rio Bravo"
"813",3476994,3480496,"I'd say he did it on purpose.And I'm telling you to hold it.","Rio Bravo"
"814",3484960,3489130,"Now hang your guns on the fenceand you can pick them up when you leave.","Rio Bravo"

"844",3596822,3598282,"I didn't ask.","Rio Bravo"
"845",3598824,3602077,"Didn't ask them to come,or ask them why they're here.","Rio Bravo"
"846",3603161,3606373,"But I think they're watching to seewhat you're going to do.","Rio Bravo"
"847",3608791,3612378,"You don't like that, do you?Too many witnesses.","Rio Bravo"
"848",3613213,3616465,"Now do you want to keep talking to meor see your brother?","Rio Bravo"

"865",3665306,3668643,"He didn't take too kindlyto being arrested for murder.","Rio Bravo"
"866",3668809,3670436,"It wasn't murder.","Rio Bravo"
"867",3670728,3673523,"If he says it wasn't murder,why do you say it was?","Rio Bravo"
"868",3673606,3677693,"Man gets shot that's got a gun,there's room for reasonable doubt.","Rio Bravo"

"876",3697630,3700092,"He's no good, but he's your brother.","Rio Bravo"
"877",3700800,3704387,"If he committed 20 murders,you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.","Rio Bravo"
"878",3704512,3706181,"I don't like that kind of talk.","Rio Bravo"
"879",3706264,3708557,"- You're accusing me...- Let's get this straight.","Rio Bravo"

"884",3720612,3723489,"And I don't like itwhen a friend of mine offers to help...","Rio Bravo"
"885",3723572,3725701,"...and 20 minutes later he's dead!","Rio Bravo"
"886",3726492,3729663,"And I don't like you, Burdette,because you set it up.","Rio Bravo"
"887",3732456,3734668,"What're you going to do about it?","Rio Bravo"
"888",3735751,3737963,"I thought you'd get around to that.","Rio Bravo"
"889",3738588,3741048,"I'm going to sit herewith your brother in my lap...","Rio Bravo"
"890",3741173,3744010,"...until the United States Marshalgets here.","Rio Bravo"
"891",3744135,3746179,"That'll be about six days.","Rio Bravo"
"892",3746512,3749682,"He may ask a few questionsabout that busted wheel.","Rio Bravo"
"893",3750309,3753561,"But I think you're too smartto have stopped that stage completely.","Rio Bravo"
"894",3753686,3755355,"Now I'm running out of breath.","Rio Bravo"
"895",3755438,3757398,"You talk if you want to.","Rio Bravo"
"896",3758065,3761027,"He talks awful big for a manthat's all alone...","Rio Bravo"
"897",3761193,3763487,"...except for a barfly and a cripple.","Rio Bravo"
"898",3764864,3767701,"- You can get me out of here any...- Shut up, Joe!","Rio Bravo"
"899",3768117,3770911,"You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.","Rio Bravo"
"900",3771538,3775541,"He sees Stumpy here sittingaround the corner locked in with you.","Rio Bravo"
"901",3776376,3779170,"And if that isn't plain enough,I'll tell you why.","Rio Bravo"
"902",3779253,3781882,"If any trouble starts around this jail...","Rio Bravo"
"903",3781965,3785969,"...before anybody can get to you,you're going to get accidentally shot.","Rio Bravo"
"904",3786552,3788847,"I can practical guarantee that.","Rio Bravo"
"905",3790097,3793059,"I see you still havea little grudge against us.","Rio Bravo"
"906",3794478,3797813,"460 acres might be little to you, Nathan.","Rio Bravo"
"907",3798440,3800275,"But it was a lot of country to me.","Rio Bravo"
"908",3800358,3804362,"Don't take no chances, Nathan.He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.","Rio Bravo"
"909",3804737,3806614,"He's smarter than I thought.","Rio Bravo"
"910",3807740,3810786,"You know,a court might just call that murder, too.","Rio Bravo"
"911",3811244,3812871,"What's the difference?","Rio Bravo"
"912",3812996,3814956,"We'd all be dead by then.","Rio Bravo"
"913",3815248,3817626,"You got anything else you want to say?","Rio Bravo"
"914",3818085,3821420,"Just one thing. Joe has friends.","Rio Bravo"
"915",3822255,3824632,"You can't hold Joeor me responsible for them...","Rio Bravo"
"916",3824715,3827594,"...what you say they've doneor what they might do.","Rio Bravo"
"917",3828052,3829637,"I want to make that clear.","Rio Bravo"
"918",3829721,3831556,"I'll help you make it clear.","Rio Bravo"
"919",3831681,3834351,"I don't think Joe's got a friend in the world.","Rio Bravo"
"920",3834434,3838688,"And he won't have any unless somebodybuys them for him at $50 a head.","Rio Bravo"
"921",3839106,3841483,"Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.","Rio Bravo"
"922",3843150,3844820,"You made it clear.","Rio Bravo"
"923",3845195,3846612,"All right, Stumpy.","Rio Bravo"
"924",3846697,3848572,"- Nathan.- Just sit tight, Joe.","Rio Bravo"
"925",3848699,3850659,"Send me a bottle before you leave town.","Rio Bravo"
"926",3850784,3854371,"You do that, because part of my jobis to see that it ain't poisoned.","Rio Bravo"
"927",3854496,3857331,"Sometimes takes quite a spell to find out.","Rio Bravo"
"928",3862170,3864463,"- He didn't have much to say, did he?- No.","Rio Bravo"
"929",3869885,3873222,"What did you leave him go for?You had plenty to hold him on.","Rio Bravo"
"930",3873347,3875016,"Anything they're going to do is...","Rio Bravo"
"931",3875099,3877561,"...planned already,or he wouldn't have come in here.","Rio Bravo"
"932",3877686,3881106,"Throwing him with Joe would give himan alibi for whatever happens.","Rio Bravo"
"933",3881188,3882565,"I never thought of that.","Rio Bravo"
"934",3882648,3884943,"- What do you think will happen?- I don't know.","Rio Bravo"
"935",3885068,3886820,"You can think, can't you? Any man...","Rio Bravo"
"936",3887320,3891240,"I think I told you to get back in thereand stay with that door locked.","Rio Bravo"
"937",3891324,3893869,"Be careful how you talk to me.You hear what Joe said.","Rio Bravo"
"938",3893994,3897331,"You're alone except for a barflyand an old cripple.","Rio Bravo"
"939",3897496,3901501,"Calling me an old cripple.I like hearing you say that, Joe.","Rio Bravo"
"940",3902043,3904588,"I got to fix your supper for you tonight.","Rio Bravo"
"941",3909842,3910927,"Señor Chance.","Rio Bravo"
"942",3911010,3912512,"It's me, Carlos.","Rio Bravo"
"943",3912596,3913972,"Come on in.","Rio Bravo"
"944",3914472,3915556,"What do you want?","Rio Bravo"
"945",3915641,3916974,"I want to talk to you.","Rio Bravo"
"946",3917059,3918518,"Did the girl...","Rio Bravo"
"947",3919478,3921146,"What happened to your eye?","Rio Bravo"
"948",3921228,3923356,"You told me to put the lady on the stage.","Rio Bravo"
"949",3923481,3925358,"She did that? What'd you do?","Rio Bravo"
"950",3925442,3927985,"- She did not do it.- I thought you said she did.","Rio Bravo"
"951",3928070,3932114,"I say you tell me to put her on the stage.Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.","Rio Bravo"
"952",3932199,3935117,"- I'm a little mixed up.- Do not talk. I tell you.","Rio Bravo"
"953",3935202,3936994,"- Okay.- It's better if I tell you.","Rio Bravo"
"954",3937079,3940998,"You told me to put her on the stage.The stage she's ready, but she don't come.","Rio Bravo"
"955",3941123,3943501,"I yell at her, ""Come down.""She said, ""No.""","Rio Bravo"
"956",3943626,3946295,"- I go and get her, she said she don't go.- Did she go?","Rio Bravo"
"957",3946380,3949090,"I tell her you say go.I tell her I am responsible.","Rio Bravo"
"958",3949173,3952177,"She say, no, she is responsible.And I said that may be.","Rio Bravo"
"959",3952260,3955764,"I pick her up. And Consuelo say,""What are you doing with that woman?""","Rio Bravo"
"960",3955847,3959268,"I say, ""I take her to the stage.""The woman said she don't want to go.","Rio Bravo"
"961",3959393,3960936,"Did she go on the stage?","Rio Bravo"
"962",3961018,3964438,"Consuelo tell me put her down.I said, ""I am responsible.""","Rio Bravo"
"963",3964563,3967693,"Consuelo thinks that mean something else.So she give me this eye.","Rio Bravo"

"965",3968985,3971822,"Do? What can I do?My arms is full of the lady.","Rio Bravo"
"966",3971905,3976284,"I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.She yells. And she says I tried to kill her.","Rio Bravo"
"967",3976367,3977952,"Did the girl get on the stage?","Rio Bravo"
"968",3978036,3980746,"No, she did not go!But Jake says he couldn't wait.","Rio Bravo"
"969",3980831,3982541,"- Why?- He says he must leave.","Rio Bravo"
"970",3982623,3985168,"I mean the girl.Did she say why she wasn't going?","Rio Bravo"
"971",3985293,3988338,"No. She didn't say.How can I know if she don't say?","Rio Bravo"

"1016",4284885,4286219,"What is it?","Rio Bravo"
"1017",4286552,4289640,"It's some Mexican piece.I heard it farther south.","Rio Bravo"

"1024",4303945,4305655,"You mean he didn't say anything?","Rio Bravo"
"1025",4305738,4307490,"Why are you so interested?","Rio Bravo"
"1026",4307573,4309618,"Because he's talking now.","Rio Bravo"
"1027",4309909,4311411,"Hear that music?","Rio Bravo"
"1028",4311536,4313329,"He told the man to play it.","Rio Bravo"
"1029",4314581,4315666,"What is it?","Rio Bravo"
"1030",4315916,4318835,"They call it The Deguello,the cutthroat song.","Rio Bravo"
"1031",4318918,4323465,"The Mexicans played it for the Texas boyswhen they had them pent up at the Alamo.","Rio Bravo"
"1032",4323590,4326301,"Played it day and night till it was all over.","Rio Bravo"
"1033",4326760,4328886,"Now do you know what he means by it?","Rio Bravo"
"1034",4329011,4330389,"No quarter.","Rio Bravo"

"1036",4333100,4334768,"You'll be hearing a lot of it.","Rio Bravo"
"1037",4334850,4337395,"I guess we made him talk after all.","Rio Bravo"
"1038",4337561,4340106,"Just thought you'd like to know, Sheriff.","Rio Bravo"
"1039",4399373,4400375,"Stumpy!","Rio Bravo"
"1040",4400667,4403587,"- What?- They don't need any help with that tune.","Rio Bravo"
"1041",4403670,4406547,"What's the matter,is it getting through to you?","Rio Bravo"
"1042",4413596,4416350,"By the way, the stage got off all right.","Rio Bravo"
"1043",4418268,4420645,"I watched it clear through the valley.","Rio Bravo"
"1044",4422355,4425317,"In about six days the marshal will get here.","Rio Bravo"
"1045",4425484,4427109,"That's what I figured.","Rio Bravo"
"1046",4430863,4432990,"The girl wasn't on the stage.","Rio Bravo"
"1047",4435493,4436869,"I know that.","Rio Bravo"
"1048",4439163,4440873,"Tell her she could stay?","Rio Bravo"
"1049",4441207,4442376,"No, she...","Rio Bravo"
"1050",4444127,4446253,"Yes, I did. What about it?","Rio Bravo"
"1051",4446462,4448172,"Nothing, nothing at all.","Rio Bravo"
"1052",4448340,4450050,"You were going to say something.","Rio Bravo"
"1053",4450132,4451926,"I remembered in time.","Rio Bravo"
"1054",4453302,4457474,"I remembered another girl came throughon a stage that stopped over.","Rio Bravo"
"1055",4458684,4461144,"I remember you told me she was no good.","Rio Bravo"
"1056",4461936,4464480,"I didn't believe you, but you were right.","Rio Bravo"
"1057",4464605,4466899,"So, naturally I figured you're an expert.","Rio Bravo"
"1058",4467024,4469944,"And you know justwhat you're doing all the time.","Rio Bravo"
"1059",4471070,4473782,"I just hope you have better luck than I had.","Rio Bravo"
"1060",4476243,4479912,"You know, that's the first timeI've been able to laugh about that.","Rio Bravo"
"1061",4480037,4481832,"Maybe there's some hope for me yet.","Rio Bravo"
"1062",4481914,4482666,"Maybe.","Rio Bravo"
"1063",4483292,4484376,"But I doubt it.","Rio Bravo"
"1064",4484501,4488087,"That's what I like about you,you're such an encouraging man.","Rio Bravo"
"1065",4489006,4492341,"If you go by the hotel,pick up some coffee and sugar, will you?","Rio Bravo"
"1066",4492426,4493676,"Joe complaining?","Rio Bravo"
"1067",4493801,4495554,"Him? He didn't get no sugar.","Rio Bravo"
"1068",4495636,4498097,"His coffee's water pouredover the old grounds.","Rio Bravo"
"1069",4498180,4500225,"I'll learn him to talk out of turn.","Rio Bravo"
"1070",4500309,4504563,"Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.You mind if I file the action a bit?","Rio Bravo"
"1071",4504645,4506939,"I don't want you to file no actionon my gun.","Rio Bravo"
"1072",4507024,4510777,"I don't want no easy pull. I mightshoot myself. Get somebody else's.","Rio Bravo"
"1073",4511110,4513404,"Why don't you give him his own guns?","Rio Bravo"
"1074",4514280,4517367,"- I forgot all about them.- Your memory is no better than mine.","Rio Bravo"
"1075",4517451,4519911,"They been locked up over a yearexcept when you...","Rio Bravo"
"1076",4520037,4522663,"...took them outto clean them and oil them.","Rio Bravo"
"1077",4530421,4532131,"Where'd you get these?","Rio Bravo"
"1078",4532591,4535385,"Bought them off the fellowyou sold them to.","Rio Bravo"
"1079",4541641,4543435,"I don't know how to...","Rio Bravo"
"1080",4544144,4547898,"Let's take a turn around the town.Get Stumpy his coffee.","Rio Bravo"
"1081",4548023,4550399,"Ain't you going to tell meto get back in there?","Rio Bravo"
"1082",4550484,4553235,"No, stay out here and get shot.","Rio Bravo"
"1083",4553654,4555697,"I might do that just for spite.","Rio Bravo"
"1084",4555948,4557908,"Might get a laugh out of you.","Rio Bravo"
"1085",4558617,4560993,"What I put up with for $30 a month.","Rio Bravo"
"1086",4580389,4581722,"Feels good.","Rio Bravo"

"1090",4587311,4590023,"In that case take outwhat you gave for these guns.","Rio Bravo"
"1091",4590106,4591358,"No hurry.","Rio Bravo"
"1092",4591858,4594610,"If you're feeling so generous,I could use an advance.","Rio Bravo"
"1093",4594694,4598532,"Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.Something without all these holes in it.","Rio Bravo"
"1094",4598657,4599740,"No need of that.","Rio Bravo"
"1095",4599865,4602828,"When you lit out,you left some things behind.","Rio Bravo"
"1096",4603537,4605413,"I got them at the hotel.","Rio Bravo"

"1886",8092024,8094653,"I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.","Rio Bravo"
"1887",8095069,8097530,"She might be leaving and she might not.","Rio Bravo"
"1888",8098073,8100117,"She might need help making up her mind.","Rio Bravo"

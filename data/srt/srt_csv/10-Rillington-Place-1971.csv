"1053",4868560,4871631,"What happened after the soundof furniture moving?","10 Rillington Place"
"1054",4871840,4873636,"I, um...","10 Rillington Place"
"1055",4873840,4878550,"I went off to sleep again.Because of the pain I was
having with the fibrositis,","10 Rillington Place"

I could get to sleep.","10 Rillington Place"

during the last war?","10 Rillington Place"
"1068",4937800,4939028,"Yes.","10 Rillington Place"

"1070",4941800,4943118,"For four years, yes.","10 Rillington Place"
"1071",4943359,4946670,"But you are not,are you, a man
of good character?","10 Rillington Place"
"1072",4951479,4955234,"Well, I...have had some trouble.","10 Rillington Place"
"1073",4955680,4959672,"I apologize for having to ask youthese questions, but I'm afraid I must.","10 Rillington Place"
"1074",4959880,4965431,"On four occasions, you have beenconvicted of offences of dishonesty,
haven't you?","10 Rillington Place"
"1075",4965760,4968592,"Three.Not four?","10 Rillington Place"
"1076",4971960,4975635,"Then perhaps I had betterput them to you.","10 Rillington Place"
"1077",4976239,4978958,"Were you sentenced tothree months' imprisonment
in 1921","10 Rillington Place"

"1091",5019239,5020672,"I see.","10 Rillington Place"
"1092",5020880,5026511,"But what is perhaps more importantand relevant to this matter,","10 Rillington Place"
"1093",5026720,5030507,"are there two other convictionsrecorded against you?","10 Rillington Place"
"1094",5032399,5034197,"Yes.","10 Rillington Place"

"1100",5052720,5053948,"[LOUDER]Yes.","10 Rillington Place"
"1101",5061520,5065034,"Do you appreciatethat the medical evidence
in this case","10 Rillington Place"
"1102",5065239,5068676,"which has been called,is that this woman
was strangled?","10 Rillington Place"
"1103",5071279,5072792,"I was informedof that, yes.","10 Rillington Place"
"1104",5073000,5075514,"Not killed by abortion,of which there is
no sign whatever,","10 Rillington Place"

for many years.","10 Rillington Place"
"1117",5124520,5127113,"Is that right?Yes, I did.","10 Rillington Place"
"1118",5127319,5130198,"And I was commendedon two occasions.","10 Rillington Place"
"1119",5131279,5133430,"Thank you, Mr. Christie.","10 Rillington Place"
"1120",5145399,5147277,"What are you doing?","10 Rillington Place"
"1121",5147880,5150632,"I'm going to sleepin the front room.","10 Rillington Place"
"1122",5153439,5155158,"Front room?","10 Rillington Place"
"1123",5155359,5159194,"On the sofa from now on.What's that in aid of?","10 Rillington Place"
"1124",5160000,5164198,"Nothing. It's just that I'm notsleeping very well, that's all.","10 Rillington Place"
"1125",5172520,5174271,"Now...","10 Rillington Place"
"1126",5174479,5177313,"it is you who voluntarilygo to the police","10 Rillington Place"
"1127",5177520,5181671,"on the 30th of Novemberafter hearing about
the telegram","10 Rillington Place"
"1128",5181880,5186270,"which your aunt hadreceived from Mr. Thorley,
your wife's father?","10 Rillington Place"
"1129",5187439,5188429,"That's right.","10 Rillington Place"
"1130",5188640,5191756,"It was because yourprevious lies were
exposed by the telegram","10 Rillington Place"
"1131",5191960,5194474,"that you decidedto go to the police, was it?","10 Rillington Place"
"1132",5194680,5196954,"It wasn't becauseof the lies.","10 Rillington Place"
"1133",5197159,5199912,"Then why did yousuddenly go to
the police?","10 Rillington Place"
"1134",5200119,5201837,"Well...","10 Rillington Place"
"1135",5202039,5204076,"I was getting worriedabout my daughter.","10 Rillington Place"
"1136",5205479,5208789,"Are you saying thatseriously to the jury?","10 Rillington Place"
"1137",5209000,5211594,"That you go to the policeand confessed a murder","10 Rillington Place"
"1138",5211800,5213711,"because you're worriedabout your daughter?","10 Rillington Place"
"1139",5213920,5216957,"With great respect,there is no confession
of murder.","10 Rillington Place"
"1140",5217159,5221789,"He said, ""I have disposedof my wife. I have put her
down the drain.""","10 Rillington Place"
"1141",5223439,5225350,"It sounds very like murder.","10 Rillington Place"
"1142",5228399,5231994,"All he said was he had put her,it might well be her body,","10 Rillington Place"
"1143",5232199,5234395,"down the drain.","10 Rillington Place"
"1144",5236600,5241798,"You made a statementto the police, and this
is the first you made...","10 Rillington Place"
"1145",5242000,5244389,"Exhibit 6.","10 Rillington Place"
"1146",5244600,5248036,"In which you talkof meeting a man in a café","10 Rillington Place"
"1147",5248239,5251073,"and of how your wifetook these pills","10 Rillington Place"
"1148",5251279,5253157,"and died of them,","10 Rillington Place"
"1149",5253359,5255668,"and you found her dead.","10 Rillington Place"
"1150",5256399,5258675,"Do you remember that statement?","10 Rillington Place"
"1151",5258880,5263032,"Yes, I remember that statement.That is untrue?","10 Rillington Place"
"1152",5264199,5265679,"That is untrue, yes.","10 Rillington Place"
"1153",5266119,5270113,"You then make a statementin which you set out
in some detail","10 Rillington Place"
"1154",5270319,5272390,"how Mr. Christiegave your wife something","10 Rillington Place"
"1155",5272600,5276797,"which would cause an abortion,and she died of that.","10 Rillington Place"
"1156",5277000,5279639,"Do you rememberthat one?","10 Rillington Place"
"1157",5280000,5281637,"Yes, I remember that one too.","10 Rillington Place"
"1158",5282359,5285033,"Is that one true or untrue?","10 Rillington Place"
"1159",5285960,5287996,"That is true.","10 Rillington Place"
"1160",5288199,5289519,"Then you made a statement","10 Rillington Place"
"1161",5289720,5294315,"in which you confessedto murdering your wife
and your child.","10 Rillington Place"
"1162",5294520,5297318,"Is that true or untrue?","10 Rillington Place"
"1163",5297520,5300636,"I was told of my daughter's deathbefore I made that one.","10 Rillington Place"
"1164",5300840,5303149,"True or untrue?","10 Rillington Place"
"1165",5306960,5309394,"It is true I made the statement.","10 Rillington Place"
"1166",5309600,5312319,"Is the statement true or untrue?","10 Rillington Place"
"1167",5315159,5316639,"Untrue.","10 Rillington Place"
"1168",5316840,5320310,"So then that is the secondstatement you have made","10 Rillington Place"
"1169",5320520,5323113,"to the police, in some detail,","10 Rillington Place"
"1170",5323319,5325550,"which is untrue.","10 Rillington Place"
"1171",5327079,5328637,"Yes.","10 Rillington Place"
"1172",5329680,5333115,"So would it not be rightto say that you are a person
who's prepared to lie,","10 Rillington Place"
"1173",5333319,5336356,"or tell the truth,at your own convenience?","10 Rillington Place"
"1174",5336560,5339676,"Well, why should I tell lies?My life is at stake here.","10 Rillington Place"
"1175",5340239,5342150,"Now...","10 Rillington Place"
"1176",5342520,5344908,"we have shown that your story","10 Rillington Place"
"1177",5345119,5348873,"about Mr. Christie givingyour wife an abortion
is nonsense.","10 Rillington Place"
"1178",5349520,5353399,"Well, you are the personwho alleges Mr. Christie
is the murderer in this case.","10 Rillington Place"
"1179",5354560,5357949,"Can you suggestwhy he should have
strangled your wife?","10 Rillington Place"
"1180",5363000,5364831,"Well...","10 Rillington Place"
"1181",5365039,5366996,"he was...","10 Rillington Place"

"1183",5370840,5374673,"Can you suggestwhy he should have
strangled your wife?","10 Rillington Place"
"1184",5382159,5383639,"No, I can't.","10 Rillington Place"
"1185",5384720,5389190,"Can you suggestwhy he should have
strangled your daughter?","10 Rillington Place"
"1186",5397359,5399112,"No.","10 Rillington Place"
"1187",5401199,5403997,"I didn't do it,Auntie.","10 Rillington Place"

brought me in to Notting Hill.","10 Rillington Place"
"1190",5411439,5414591,"Well, Christie saidshe was in East Acton.","10 Rillington Place"
"1191",5415119,5416792,"Get Christie.","10 Rillington Place"
"1192",5417000,5420912,"Get him here to see me.He's the only one

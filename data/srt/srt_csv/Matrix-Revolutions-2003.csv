"84",345389,346470,"What choice?","Matrix Revolutions"
"85",347250,349750,"To help you, to guide Neo.","Matrix Revolutions"
"86",350149,352720,"Now, since the real test for any choice...","Matrix Revolutions"

"88",355290,357560,"...knowing full well what it might cost...","Matrix Revolutions"
"89",359319,362319,"...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice...","Matrix Revolutions"

"94",375779,379339,"The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.","Matrix Revolutions"
"95",380209,383860,"He used to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.","Matrix Revolutions"
"96",384540,387829,"If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...","Matrix Revolutions"

"98",391639,392319,"Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"99",392659,394829,"Because of who the Trainman works for.","Matrix Revolutions"
"100",394889,396170,"The Merovingian.","Matrix Revolutions"
"101",396590,401069,"He's placed a bounty on your lives. You must be careful at all times.","Matrix Revolutions"
"102",401990,405930,"Seraph knows how to find the Trainman, he'll go with you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"103",406310,408980,"For years he has protected me.","Matrix Revolutions"
"104",410350,412769,"I hope he can do the same for you.","Matrix Revolutions"

"107",423540,425069,"I know Morpheus.","Matrix Revolutions"
"108",425860,429730,"I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.","Matrix Revolutions"
"109",430060,432029,"After everything that has happened...","Matrix Revolutions"
"110",432110,434410,"How can you expect me to believe you?","Matrix Revolutions"
"111",434519,435850,"I don't.","Matrix Revolutions"
"112",436459,438860,"I expect just what I've always expected.","Matrix Revolutions"
"113",438860,441769,"For you to make up your own damn mind.","Matrix Revolutions"
"114",441910,443589,"Believe me or don't.","Matrix Revolutions"
"115",443779,446720,"All I can do is to tell you that your friend is in trouble...","Matrix Revolutions"
"116",446980,448579,"...and he needs your help.","Matrix Revolutions"
"117",449389,451620,"He needs all our help.","Matrix Revolutions"
"118",453050,454870,"Are you from the Matrix?","Matrix Revolutions"
"119",454949,456550,"Yes. No.","Matrix Revolutions"
"120",456620,458659,"I mean I was.","Matrix Revolutions"
"121",458680,460199,"Why did you leave?","Matrix Revolutions"
"122",462389,465699,"I had to. I had to leave my home too.","Matrix Revolutions"
"123",466040,467959,"Sati, come here darling.","Matrix Revolutions"
"124",468149,469620,"Leave the poor man in peace.","Matrix Revolutions"
"125",469800,472220,"Yes papa.","Matrix Revolutions"
"126",476129,478800,"I am sorry, she's still very curious.","Matrix Revolutions"
"127",480149,483680,"I know you. Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.","Matrix Revolutions"
"128",483790,487129,"I'm Rama-Kandra. This is my wife Kamala.","Matrix Revolutions"
"129",487240,488610,"My daughter Sati.","Matrix Revolutions"
"130",489069,491370,"We are most honoured to meet you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"131",491379,493029,"You are programs.","Matrix Revolutions"
"132",493029,498149,"Oh yes! I'm the power plant systems manager for recycling operations.","Matrix Revolutions"
"133",498209,502459,"My wife is an interactive software programmer. She's highly creative.","Matrix Revolutions"
"134",502649,505120,"What are you doing here? You do not belong here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"135",505199,507550,"Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.","Matrix Revolutions"
"136",508199,509910,"My wife can be very direct.","Matrix Revolutions"
"137",511529,512659,"It's ok.","Matrix Revolutions"
"138",513269,514789,"I don't have an answer.","Matrix Revolutions"
"139",515019,516620,"I don't even know where 'here' is.","Matrix Revolutions"
"140",516929,518570,"This place is nowhere.","Matrix Revolutions"
"141",518929,521919,"It is between your world and our world.","Matrix Revolutions"
"142",523000,526259,"Who's the Trainman? He works for the Frenchman.","Matrix Revolutions"
"143",526529,528440,"Why did I know you were going to say that...","Matrix Revolutions"
"144",528490,530360,"The Frenchman does not forget.","Matrix Revolutions"
"145",530840,532980,"And he does not forgive.","Matrix Revolutions"
"146",533059,535679,"You know him? I know only what I need to know.","Matrix Revolutions"
"147",535779,539460,"I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...","Matrix Revolutions"
"148",539519,542850,"...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.","Matrix Revolutions"
"149",543299,545090,"Is that what you are doing here?","Matrix Revolutions"
"150",545120,548669,"Rama, please! I do not want to be cruel Kamala.","Matrix Revolutions"
"151",549159,551720,"He may never see another face for the rest of his life.","Matrix Revolutions"
"152",552330,553330,"I'm sorry.","Matrix Revolutions"
"153",554129,555669,"You don't have to answer that question.","Matrix Revolutions"
"154",555769,557139,"No, I don't mind.","Matrix Revolutions"
"155",558129,559750,"The answer is simple.","Matrix Revolutions"
"156",565600,567840,"I love my daughter very much.","Matrix Revolutions"
"157",568409,571389,"I find her to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.","Matrix Revolutions"
"158",572080,574230,"But where we're from that is not enough.","Matrix Revolutions"
"159",575000,577750,"Every program that is created must have a purpose.","Matrix Revolutions"
"160",577850,580370,"If it does not, it is deleted.","Matrix Revolutions"
"161",581539,584289,"I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.","Matrix Revolutions"
"162",586769,589889,"You do not understand? I just have never...","Matrix Revolutions"
"163",590200,592970,"Heard a program speak of love.","Matrix Revolutions"
"164",593269,595460,"It's a human emotion.","Matrix Revolutions"
"165",595570,597070,"No, it's a word.","Matrix Revolutions"
"166",597070,603070,"What matters is the connection the word implies.","Matrix Revolutions"
"167",604389,606919,"I see that you are in love.","Matrix Revolutions"
"168",608269,612059,"Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?","Matrix Revolutions"
"169",612299,613710,"Anything.","Matrix Revolutions"
"170",614059,618480,"Then perhaps the reason you're here, isn't so different from the reason I'm here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"171",626149,627669,"That's him.","Matrix Revolutions"
"172",630149,631860,"Get away! Get away from me!","Matrix Revolutions"
"173",631970,633519,"We don't want trouble.","Matrix Revolutions"
"174",633549,636269,"Get the hell away from me! We need your help.","Matrix Revolutions"

"176",690330,692100,"Oh, no.","Matrix Revolutions"
"177",704679,705960,"Damn it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"178",709110,710840,"When is the train due?","Matrix Revolutions"
"179",711000,712990,"It's already late.","Matrix Revolutions"
"180",713399,715840,"It's not like the Trainman to be late.","Matrix Revolutions"
"181",716289,718250,"You think it has something to do with me?","Matrix Revolutions"
"182",718470,721490,"I cannot say. Who knows such thing?","Matrix Revolutions"
"183",721549,724159,"Only the Oracle. You know the Oracle?","Matrix Revolutions"
"184",724179,726179,"Everyone knows the Oracle.","Matrix Revolutions"
"185",726389,728590,"I consulted with her before i met with the Frenchman.","Matrix Revolutions"
"186",728590,731580,"She promised she would look after Sati after we said goodbye.","Matrix Revolutions"
"187",731730,733029,"Goodbye?","Matrix Revolutions"
"188",733840,735169,"You're not staying with her?","Matrix Revolutions"
"189",735279,736690,"It is not possible.","Matrix Revolutions"
"190",736720,740299,"Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.","Matrix Revolutions"
"191",740460,743169,"My wife and I must return to our world.","Matrix Revolutions"
"192",743230,744370,"Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"193",744629,746070,"That is our karma.","Matrix Revolutions"
"194",746110,747590,"You believe in karma?","Matrix Revolutions"
"195",747700,750330,"Karma is a word, like love.","Matrix Revolutions"
"196",750519,755200,"A way of saying 'what I'm here to do'.","Matrix Revolutions"
"197",755399,757230,"I do not resent my karma.","Matrix Revolutions"
"198",757649,762570,"I'm grateful for it, grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.","Matrix Revolutions"
"199",762850,767389,"They are gifts. And so I do what I must do to honour them.","Matrix Revolutions"
"200",768389,771690,"Papa, the train! Yes! Find your bag!","Matrix Revolutions"
"201",771879,773000,"Quickly!","Matrix Revolutions"

"205",792250,794779,"Who are you? He is a friend.","Matrix Revolutions"
"206",794820,798049,"Rama! I know you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"207",798929,801620,"So that's what they wanted.","Matrix Revolutions"
"208",801700,803570,"I need to get back.","Matrix Revolutions"
"209",803820,805899,"I'll pay you whatever you want.","Matrix Revolutions"
"210",806110,808539,"One way or another I'm getting on this train.","Matrix Revolutions"
"211",808620,809799,"Oh no, no, no, no, no.","Matrix Revolutions"
"212",810429,814220,"You're gonna stay right here until the Merovingian says different.","Matrix Revolutions"
"213",814350,819200,"If I know him, you're gonna be here for a long, long time.","Matrix Revolutions"
"214",819429,821409,"I don't wanna hurt you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"215",821419,826080,"You don't get it. I built this place.","Matrix Revolutions"
"216",826320,831539,"Down here I make the rules. Down here I make the threats.","Matrix Revolutions"
"217",836519,839610,"Down here, I'm God.","Matrix Revolutions"
"218",841429,844980,"Get on the train or you're gonna stay here with him.","Matrix Revolutions"
"219",860759,863919,"We should return to the Oracle. She will know what to do.","Matrix Revolutions"
"220",864039,865169,"No.","Matrix Revolutions"
"221",865629,868190,"We know what has to be done.","Matrix Revolutions"
"222",882809,883970,"Shit!","Matrix Revolutions"
"223",912210,914139,"You gotta be kidding.","Matrix Revolutions"
"224",915149,917570,"Holy shit. It's wingless.","Matrix Revolutions"
"225",917879,922200,"I get it. You must be ready to die.","Matrix Revolutions"
"226",922690,924259,"I need to speak with him.","Matrix Revolutions"
"227",924330,926149,"Only way you're getting through this door...","Matrix Revolutions"
"228",926750,929759,"...is over my big dead ass.","Matrix Revolutions"
"229",929779,931740,"So be it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"230",954600,957070,"There are no weapons allowed in the club.","Matrix Revolutions"
"231",957110,960629,"At the bottom of this elevator there is a coat-check girl.","Matrix Revolutions"
"232",960659,963669,"And if we're lucky, one man for checking weapons.","Matrix Revolutions"
"233",964350,965789,"And if we're unlucky?","Matrix Revolutions"
"234",966320,968590,"There will be many men.","Matrix Revolutions"
"235",970000,973210,"Can I take your...? Oh my God.","Matrix Revolutions"
"236",1114049,1116569,"What in the hell?","Matrix Revolutions"

"242",1143809,1147269,"Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?","Matrix Revolutions"
"243",1147349,1151150,"I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.","Matrix Revolutions"
"244",1151349,1153250,"We only want to talk. Oh, yes.","Matrix Revolutions"
"245",1153359,1158059,"I'm sure you do. You have fought through hell to do so.","Matrix Revolutions"
"246",1158109,1160920,"Yes. I'll tell you what I'll do.","Matrix Revolutions"
"247",1160960,1165660,"Put down the guns and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.","Matrix Revolutions"

"251",1197460,1201000,"Who could have guessed we would all be seeing each other so soon...","Matrix Revolutions"
"252",1201410,1206230,"...after our last meeting? A fate too kind.","Matrix Revolutions"

"255",1215130,1216369,"Disappointing.","Matrix Revolutions"
"256",1216769,1218549,"But not unexpected.","Matrix Revolutions"
"257",1218619,1221680,"I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson.","Matrix Revolutions"
"258",1222019,1225230,"And to remember there is no action without consequence.","Matrix Revolutions"
"259",1225349,1227930,"And if you take something from me...","Matrix Revolutions"
"260",1228029,1230700,"...you will pay the price.","Matrix Revolutions"
"261",1230910,1233099,"You know why we are here?","Matrix Revolutions"

"263",1240130,1243650,"Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.","Matrix Revolutions"
"264",1243730,1246269,"I'm curious, though, as to...","Matrix Revolutions"
"265",1246390,1249579,"...how it actually happened.","Matrix Revolutions"
"266",1249960,1252109,"Do you know? No.","Matrix Revolutions"
"267",1252380,1253559,"No?","Matrix Revolutions"
"268",1254319,1256019,"I did not think so.","Matrix Revolutions"
"269",1256720,1259769,"But it is always best to ask.","Matrix Revolutions"
"270",1259859,1262130,"We want to make a deal.","Matrix Revolutions"
"271",1263309,1269309,"Always straight to business. Uh, Morpheus? Ok.","Matrix Revolutions"
"272",1269680,1272509,"I have something you want.","Matrix Revolutions"

"276",1284720,1289210,"Something I have wanted ever since I first came here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"277",1289279,1291940,"It is said they cannot be taken.","Matrix Revolutions"
"278",1292019,1295089,"they can only be given.","Matrix Revolutions"
"279",1295150,1297069,"What?","Matrix Revolutions"
"280",1298710,1301720,"The eyes of the Oracle.","Matrix Revolutions"
"281",1304960,1308880,"I have told you before, there's no escaping the nature of the universe.","Matrix Revolutions"
"282",1308980,1311700,"It is that nature that has again brought you to me.","Matrix Revolutions"
"283",1311759,1315710,"Where some see coincidence, I see consequence.","Matrix Revolutions"
"284",1315779,1319619,"Where others see chance, I see...","Matrix Revolutions"
"285",1319660,1321569,"...cost.","Matrix Revolutions"
"286",1323869,1327230,"Bring me the eyes of the Oracle.","Matrix Revolutions"
"287",1327670,1331150,"And I will give you back your saviour.","Matrix Revolutions"
"288",1331690,1335210,"It seems a particularly fair and reasonable deal to me.","Matrix Revolutions"

"292",1376339,1381210,"You give me Neo, or we all die right here, right now.","Matrix Revolutions"
"293",1381750,1384009,"Interesting deal.","Matrix Revolutions"
"294",1386029,1391480,"You are really ready to die for this man?","Matrix Revolutions"
"295",1392279,1394049,"Believe it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"296",1394240,1398859,"She'll do it. If she has to she'll kill every one of us.","Matrix Revolutions"
"297",1399190,1402180,"She's in love. It's remarkable how similar...","Matrix Revolutions"
"298",1402180,1404069,"...the pattern of love is...","Matrix Revolutions"
"299",1404069,1406680,"...to the pattern of insanity.","Matrix Revolutions"
"300",1406759,1408250,"Time's up.","Matrix Revolutions"
"301",1408400,1410759,"What's it gonna be Merv?","Matrix Revolutions"
"302",1414990,1418430,"Ok, you got yourself in here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"303",1419180,1421410,"You can get yourself out.","Matrix Revolutions"
"304",1468720,1470490,"Are you ready for us?","Matrix Revolutions"
"305",1470589,1474099,"Almost, Sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here, we're working on it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"306",1474160,1474799,"Did you find Neo?","Matrix Revolutions"
"307",1474910,1476640,"Can't you see him? No, Sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"308",1476710,1479269,"We were reading something but I couldn't tell what it was.","Matrix Revolutions"

"310",1487930,1490210,"I have to see her.","Matrix Revolutions"
"311",1490980,1492289,"Now?","Matrix Revolutions"
"312",1494210,1496210,"It's my last chance.","Matrix Revolutions"
"313",1498259,1500609,"That's it, that's the secret.","Matrix Revolutions"
"314",1500680,1503500,"You've got to use your hands. Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"315",1503579,1506690,"Cookies need love, like everything does.","Matrix Revolutions"
"316",1507779,1508630,"Neo.","Matrix Revolutions"
"317",1509740,1513490,"I was hoping to have these done before you got here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"318",1513490,1516539,"Oh, well. Sati, honey...","Matrix Revolutions"
"319",1516740,1518740,"...I think it's time for a tasting.","Matrix Revolutions"
"320",1518880,1522119,"Take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.","Matrix Revolutions"
"321",1522150,1522690,"Ok.","Matrix Revolutions"
"322",1524769,1527930,"I'm glad you got out. Me too.","Matrix Revolutions"
"323",1531049,1532019,"So...","Matrix Revolutions"
"324",1532559,1535539,"Do you recognize me? A part of you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"325",1535769,1538240,"Yeah, that's how it works.","Matrix Revolutions"
"326",1538329,1540900,"Some bits you lose, some bits you keep.","Matrix Revolutions"
"327",1541059,1545089,"I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror, but...","Matrix Revolutions"

"329",1550880,1552490,"No, thank you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"330",1552549,1555630,"Remember what you were like when you first walked through my door?","Matrix Revolutions"
"331",1555680,1558299,"Jittery as a june bug.","Matrix Revolutions"
"332",1558400,1560789,"And now just look at you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"333",1561130,1564680,"You sure did surprise me, Neo. And you still do.","Matrix Revolutions"
"334",1564769,1567400,"You gave me a few surprises too.","Matrix Revolutions"
"335",1567920,1570369,"I hope I helped.","Matrix Revolutions"
"336",1570420,1574059,"You helped me to get here, but my question's why.","Matrix Revolutions"
"337",1574099,1576039,"Where is this going?","Matrix Revolutions"
"338",1576059,1577440,"Where does it end?","Matrix Revolutions"
"339",1577450,1580660,"I don't know. You don't know, or you won't tell me?","Matrix Revolutions"
"340",1580690,1582769,"I told you before...","Matrix Revolutions"
"341",1582769,1586670,"no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand.","Matrix Revolutions"
"342",1586700,1587539,"And I mean no one.","Matrix Revolutions"
"343",1587700,1589259,"What choice?","Matrix Revolutions"
"344",1589369,1590779,"It doesn't matter.","Matrix Revolutions"
"345",1590849,1594970,"It's my choice. I have mine to make, the same as you have yours.","Matrix Revolutions"
"346",1595039,1598369,"Does that include what things to tell me and what not to tell me?","Matrix Revolutions"
"347",1598369,1599410,"Of course not.","Matrix Revolutions"
"348",1599569,1601480,"Then why didn't you tell me about the architect?","Matrix Revolutions"
"349",1601559,1604299,"Why didn't you tell me about Zion, the Ones before me?","Matrix Revolutions"
"350",1604339,1606119,"Why didn't you tell me the truth?","Matrix Revolutions"
"351",1606200,1609069,"Because it wasn't time for you to know.","Matrix Revolutions"
"352",1609180,1610970,"Who decided it wasn't time?","Matrix Revolutions"
"353",1611069,1613240,"You know who.","Matrix Revolutions"
"354",1615190,1617150,"KNOW THYSELF","Matrix Revolutions"
"355",1620599,1622490,"I did.","Matrix Revolutions"
"356",1623490,1626529,"Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things.","Matrix Revolutions"
"357",1626569,1628970,"So do I.","Matrix Revolutions"
"358",1629089,1632369,"Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.","Matrix Revolutions"
"359",1632380,1636559,"Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"360",1636849,1639130,"Tell me just what the hell is happening to me.","Matrix Revolutions"
"361",1642190,1645740,"The power of the One extends beyond this world.","Matrix Revolutions"
"362",1645829,1649359,"It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.","Matrix Revolutions"
"363",1649380,1650430,"Where?","Matrix Revolutions"
"364",1650589,1654990,"The Source, that's what you felt when you touched those sentinels.","Matrix Revolutions"
"365",1655049,1656910,"But you weren't ready for it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"366",1656950,1658859,"You should be dead.","Matrix Revolutions"
"367",1658900,1662109,"But apparently you weren't ready for that either.","Matrix Revolutions"
"368",1663960,1667130,"The architect told me that if I didn't return to the Source...","Matrix Revolutions"
"369",1667130,1669529,"...Zion would be destroyed by midnight tonight.","Matrix Revolutions"
"370",1669710,1670720,"Please...","Matrix Revolutions"
"371",1671140,1674240,"You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...","Matrix Revolutions"
"372",1674279,1676680,"...but that man can't see past any choice.","Matrix Revolutions"
"373",1677289,1681500,"Why not? He doesn't understand them. He can't.","Matrix Revolutions"
"374",1681519,1684140,"To him they're variables in an equation.","Matrix Revolutions"
"375",1684450,1689630,"One at a time each variable must be solved and countered. That's his purpose.","Matrix Revolutions"
"376",1690049,1692299,"To balance the equation.","Matrix Revolutions"
"377",1692589,1694529,"What's your purpose?","Matrix Revolutions"
"378",1694789,1696890,"To unbalance it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"379",1697039,1698089,"Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"380",1698470,1699940,"What do you want?","Matrix Revolutions"
"381",1700029,1702589,"I want the same thing you want Neo.","Matrix Revolutions"
"382",1703490,1706740,"And I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"383",1706769,1709640,"The end of the war.","Matrix Revolutions"
"384",1709970,1712039,"Is it going to end?","Matrix Revolutions"
"385",1712099,1714579,"One way or another.","Matrix Revolutions"
"386",1714819,1717819,"Can Zion be saved?","Matrix Revolutions"
"387",1718609,1723670,"I'm sorry I don't have the answer to that question, but...","Matrix Revolutions"
"388",1724359,1726029,"If there's an answer...","Matrix Revolutions"
"389",1726609,1729319,"...there's only one place you're going to find it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"390",1729380,1730609,"Where?","Matrix Revolutions"
"391",1730740,1732700,"You know where.","Matrix Revolutions"
"392",1733769,1736279,"And if you can't find the answer...","Matrix Revolutions"
"393",1737299,1741240,"...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.","Matrix Revolutions"
"394",1742509,1744650,"What does that mean?","Matrix Revolutions"
"395",1749039,1751869,"Everything that has a beginning...","Matrix Revolutions"
"396",1752799,1754950,"...has an end.","Matrix Revolutions"
"397",1755589,1757970,"I see the end coming.","Matrix Revolutions"
"398",1758079,1761210,"I see the darkness spreading.","Matrix Revolutions"
"399",1761769,1763759,"I see death.","Matrix Revolutions"
"400",1763920,1767150,"And you are all that stands in his way.","Matrix Revolutions"
"401",1767289,1770950,"Smith. Very soon...","Matrix Revolutions"
"402",1771089,1774150,"...he's going to have the power to destroy this world.","Matrix Revolutions"
"403",1774269,1777200,"But I believe he won't stop there, he can't.","Matrix Revolutions"
"404",1777309,1780509,"He won't stop until there's nothing left at all.","Matrix Revolutions"
"405",1780670,1784109,"What is he? He is you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"406",1784250,1786819,"Your opposite. Your negative.","Matrix Revolutions"
"407",1786910,1790750,"The result of the equation trying to balance itself out.","Matrix Revolutions"
"408",1790769,1792569,"And if I can't stop him?","Matrix Revolutions"
"409",1792710,1795029,"One way or another, Neo...","Matrix Revolutions"
"410",1795289,1798700,"...this war is going to end.","Matrix Revolutions"
"411",1798920,1806390,"Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands or in his.","Matrix Revolutions"
"412",1822380,1823700,"How are you feeling?","Matrix Revolutions"
"413",1823789,1825299,"Are you alright?","Matrix Revolutions"
"414",1831710,1834130,"I need time.","Matrix Revolutions"
"415",1838839,1841470,"That figures. Captain Roland.","Matrix Revolutions"
"416",1842500,1845130,"What's up Maggie? Bane is. He's conscious.","Matrix Revolutions"
"417",1845279,1848690,"Good. Maybe he's got some answers.","Matrix Revolutions"
"418",1854509,1856769,"I love that smell.","Matrix Revolutions"
"419",1857609,1860740,"I sure am gonna miss it.","Matrix Revolutions"

"421",1867039,1869250,"Sati, honey...","Matrix Revolutions"
"422",1870329,1876329,"Take a few cookies and go with Seraph. Can I come back? I would like to come back.","Matrix Revolutions"
"423",1876380,1880019,"I would like that too. Then I'll see you tomorrow.","Matrix Revolutions"

"425",1906750,1909259,"I'm scared Seraph.","Matrix Revolutions"
"426",1910380,1911230,"Come.","Matrix Revolutions"
"427",1955269,1957569,"He's following us.","Matrix Revolutions"
"428",1962349,1965400,"Well, well, it's been a long time.","Matrix Revolutions"
"429",1967269,1973369,"I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost. I have beaten you before.","Matrix Revolutions"
"430",1973430,1978230,"Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.","Matrix Revolutions"
"431",1979859,1985119,"And you must be the last exile. The Oracle told me about you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"432",1985500,1987089,"Really?","Matrix Revolutions"
"433",1987089,1991490,"What did she say about me? That you're a bad man.","Matrix Revolutions"
"434",1991730,1994259,"Oh, I'm not so bad...","Matrix Revolutions"
"435",1994319,1997450,"...once you get to know me.","Matrix Revolutions"
"436",2024549,2030019,"The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.","Matrix Revolutions"
"437",2032160,2035930,"I suppose you've been expecting me. Right?","Matrix Revolutions"
"438",2036730,2042480,"The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be? she knows everything.","Matrix Revolutions"
"439",2043200,2046420,"But if that's true, then why is she here?","Matrix Revolutions"
"440",2046470,2050269,"If she knew I was coming, why wouldn't she leave?","Matrix Revolutions"
"441",2054860,2057789,"Maybe you knew I was going to do that, maybe you didn't.","Matrix Revolutions"
"442",2057929,2060440,"If you did, that means you baked those cookies and...","Matrix Revolutions"
"443",2060440,2063019,"...set that plate right there deliberately, purposefully.","Matrix Revolutions"
"444",2063110,2067940,"Which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.","Matrix Revolutions"
"445",2068420,2070840,"What did you do with Sati?","Matrix Revolutions"
"446",2070980,2076489,"Cookies need love, like everything does.","Matrix Revolutions"
"447",2077090,2079550,"You are a bastard.","Matrix Revolutions"
"448",2079969,2083730,"You would know Mom.","Matrix Revolutions"

"455",2146309,2148639,"Yeah, definitely.","Matrix Revolutions"
"456",2148989,2151239,"You're right about that, Sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"457",2151909,2155280,"They look like they might be self-inflicted.","Matrix Revolutions"
"458",2155389,2159360,"But, why would I do something like that to myself?","Matrix Revolutions"
"459",2160050,2163809,"Unless of course I wasn't myself.","Matrix Revolutions"
"460",2164210,2169719,"But if I'm not me, then who am I?","Matrix Revolutions"
"461",2174219,2178980,"Has this man been tested for VDTs? Yes sir, it was negative.","Matrix Revolutions"
"462",2179070,2182420,"But he's showing a lot of unusual neural activity.","Matrix Revolutions"
"463",2182420,2186230,"Some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...","Matrix Revolutions"
"464",2186250,2189849,"...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.","Matrix Revolutions"
"465",2190079,2195590,"I want the truth, I don't care what it takes. Make him remember.","Matrix Revolutions"
"466",2216380,2219090,"Sir, we found her! The Logos?","Matrix Revolutions"
"467",2219170,2222449,"Yes sir. 'Bout time we had some goddamn good news.","Matrix Revolutions"
"468",2251480,2254730,"Are the thermals picking up any signs of life?","Matrix Revolutions"
"469",2255039,2257449,"No sir. Nothing yet.","Matrix Revolutions"
"470",2257530,2261019,"What about the ship? Holographic says the hull's intact.","Matrix Revolutions"
"471",2261119,2263079,"Drop her down, and keep a man in the rear turret.","Matrix Revolutions"
"472",2263099,2263920,"Yes, Sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"473",2274460,2279010,"Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.","Matrix Revolutions"
"474",2296179,2300130,"Careful sir, the squids are sneaky bastards.","Matrix Revolutions"
"475",2300130,2302320,"Could be a trap.","Matrix Revolutions"
"476",2327500,2329489,"What was that?","Matrix Revolutions"
"477",2331940,2335829,"You can put that shit away boys, all she needs is a jump.","Matrix Revolutions"
"478",2336510,2337400,"Niobe.","Matrix Revolutions"
"479",2337750,2338760,"Morpheus.","Matrix Revolutions"
"480",2343469,2345969,"Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine.","Matrix Revolutions"
"481",2346010,2349730,"We didn't know what happened after...","Matrix Revolutions"
"482",2350760,2352030,"I'm sorry.","Matrix Revolutions"
"483",2352150,2353369,"It's ok...","Matrix Revolutions"
"484",2353909,2356409,"I'm happy to see you too.","Matrix Revolutions"
"485",2356789,2359059,"Did you get Neo out? Yes.","Matrix Revolutions"
"486",2359119,2361260,"How did you know about that? The Oracle.","Matrix Revolutions"
"487",2361300,2364769,"You saw her? Just before the Sentinels found us.","Matrix Revolutions"
"488",2364809,2365780,"What did she tell you?","Matrix Revolutions"
"489",2365840,2369070,"The same things she always does.","Matrix Revolutions"
"490",2369730,2373369,"Exactly what I needed to hear.","Matrix Revolutions"
"491",2373679,2377309,"In less than 12 hours the machines will breach the dock walls.","Matrix Revolutions"
"492",2377349,2381949,"Every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city...","Matrix Revolutions"
"493",2381960,2384860,"...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.","Matrix Revolutions"
"494",2384860,2387469,"Thus our primary objective must be to destroy...","Matrix Revolutions"
"495",2387500,2390800,"...or disable the diggers inside the dock.","Matrix Revolutions"
"496",2390829,2394639,"If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.","Matrix Revolutions"
"497",2395059,2397059,"If not, the only place we would be able to mount an...","Matrix Revolutions"
"498",2397059,2400679,"...effective defense would be at the entrance of the Temple.","Matrix Revolutions"
"499",2400789,2403429,"It's small enough that it would force them into a bottleneck...","Matrix Revolutions"
"500",2403500,2406940,"...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.","Matrix Revolutions"
"501",2406969,2410050,"We understand that you've requested additional volunteers.","Matrix Revolutions"
"502",2410170,2411219,"That is correct.","Matrix Revolutions"
"503",2411340,2413610,"Precisely what size of force are you planning...","Matrix Revolutions"
"504",2413610,2416510,"...to commit to the primary dock objective?","Matrix Revolutions"
"505",2416579,2419949,"Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.","Matrix Revolutions"
"506",2420010,2423239,"Half the infantry? If it were up to me Councillor...","Matrix Revolutions"
"507",2423349,2425929,"I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in...","Matrix Revolutions"
"508",2425929,2428429,"...their hand and march them straight into that dock.","Matrix Revolutions"
"509",2428510,2431429,"Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"510",2431480,2434000,"Time will tell, Councillor.","Matrix Revolutions"
"511",2434039,2436650,"Commander, just one more question.","Matrix Revolutions"
"512",2436699,2439610,"Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar? None.","Matrix Revolutions"
"513",2439719,2442760,"And at this point there's no reason to expect there ever will be.","Matrix Revolutions"
"514",2442940,2444150,"Perhaps.","Matrix Revolutions"
"515",2444190,2446369,"But we can hope.","Matrix Revolutions"
"516",2446400,2451420,"I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.","Matrix Revolutions"
"517",2461719,2463050,"Zee, what are you doing?","Matrix Revolutions"
"518",2463079,2464800,"Making shells.","Matrix Revolutions"
"519",2464880,2467539,"They're evacuating our level, we have to go.","Matrix Revolutions"
"520",2467630,2470489,"I'm not going with you. What?","Matrix Revolutions"
"521",2470590,2474130,"They've called for volunteers to hold the dock.","Matrix Revolutions"
"522",2477239,2479389,"Kids, you stay here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"523",2480739,2484659,"I know how you feel, Zee, but you can't do this.","Matrix Revolutions"
"524",2484670,2485780,"I have to. Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"525",2485780,2488610,"Because I love him.","Matrix Revolutions"
"526",2489300,2491630,"I love him the same as he loves me.","Matrix Revolutions"
"527",2491869,2495289,"And if I were out there and he were here I know what he'd do.","Matrix Revolutions"
"528",2495869,2498369,"But you're gonna get yourself killed.","Matrix Revolutions"
"529",2498539,2500630,"It's crazy Zee.","Matrix Revolutions"
"530",2500739,2503000,"Maybe it is.","Matrix Revolutions"
"531",2503340,2505340,"But ask yourself, if it were Dozer, you knew the only...","Matrix Revolutions"
"532",2505429,2509030,"...chance you had to see him again was to hold the dock.","Matrix Revolutions"
"533",2509119,2510909,"What would you do?","Matrix Revolutions"
"534",2516300,2518219,"Make shells.","Matrix Revolutions"
"535",2529159,2531800,"What the shit is going on over here?","Matrix Revolutions"
"536",2531920,2533840,"An accident, sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"537",2534119,2537159,"I didn't see, sorry.","Matrix Revolutions"
"538",2537280,2540800,"Who the hell are you? A unit volunteer sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"539",2541119,2545750,"What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my corps?","Matrix Revolutions"
"540",2545760,2547679,"I wanna do my part, sir!","Matrix Revolutions"
"541",2547750,2550289,"We gotta hold the dock.","Matrix Revolutions"
"542",2550300,2551630,"How old are you, kid?","Matrix Revolutions"
"543",2551630,2555539,"Eighteen. Should have said sixteen, I might have believed that!","Matrix Revolutions"
"544",2556309,2559280,"Ok, I'm sixteen. Minimum age for the corps is 18.","Matrix Revolutions"
"545",2559369,2560949,"Sixteen's too young.","Matrix Revolutions"
"546",2561289,2566480,"Machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me just the same.","Matrix Revolutions"
"547",2566849,2569079,"Ain't that the goddamned truth.","Matrix Revolutions"
"548",2569139,2571090,"Give me a chance, Sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"549",2571139,2573070,"I won't let you down.","Matrix Revolutions"
"550",2573090,2579349,"You do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.","Matrix Revolutions"
"551",2591449,2593599,"Ok, charge the igniter.","Matrix Revolutions"
"552",2600570,2602130,"She lives again.","Matrix Revolutions"
"553",2602159,2605739,"You want us to patch an uplink to reload the operations software, Sparky?","Matrix Revolutions"
"554",2605820,2610070,"Yeah, that'd be swell. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?","Matrix Revolutions"
"555",2613860,2616849,"Uplinks are in place, I'm bringing her back online.","Matrix Revolutions"
"556",2616849,2620159,"Looking good, except uh...","Matrix Revolutions"
"557",2621510,2623800,"Something's wrong with the Matrix feed.","Matrix Revolutions"
"558",2623820,2624809,"No there's not.","Matrix Revolutions"
"559",2625079,2626869,"You're looking at what we're looking at.","Matrix Revolutions"
"560",2626929,2628349,"What the hell is going on in there?","Matrix Revolutions"
"561",2628420,2631159,"Whatever it is, it can't be good.","Matrix Revolutions"
"562",2631449,2634300,"The machines have taken Junction 21.","Matrix Revolutions"
"563",2634369,2637639,"The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...","Matrix Revolutions"
"564",2637710,2640199,"...at Interstate 153, we might surprise them.","Matrix Revolutions"
"565",2640849,2645219,"We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.","Matrix Revolutions"
"566",2645230,2649090,"Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.","Matrix Revolutions"
"567",2649739,2654929,"It ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.","Matrix Revolutions"
"568",2655690,2656860,"No it's not.","Matrix Revolutions"
"569",2657409,2658900,"There's another way.","Matrix Revolutions"
"570",2659110,2660449,"A support line.","Matrix Revolutions"
"571",2660590,2662190,"It drops down right here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"572",2662210,2664329,"A thousand meters short of 21.","Matrix Revolutions"
"573",2664409,2668579,"If we're lucky we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.","Matrix Revolutions"
"574",2668889,2672480,"That's a mechanical line. It's impossible, no one can pilot a mechanical.","Matrix Revolutions"
"575",2672480,2673340,"I can.","Matrix Revolutions"
"576",2673409,2674190,"Bullshit.","Matrix Revolutions"
"577",2674380,2677619,"I've done it. That was a long time ago, Niobe.","Matrix Revolutions"
"578",2677690,2679170,"I said I can do it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"579",2679340,2681840,"So what? If you can you'll be the only one that can.","Matrix Revolutions"
"580",2681840,2683650,"There's no way we can follow you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"581",2686250,2687599,"Hi.","Matrix Revolutions"
"582",2689539,2693869,"I know time is always against us. I'm sorry that I took so long.","Matrix Revolutions"
"583",2694170,2697559,"But I wanted to be sure. Sure of what?","Matrix Revolutions"
"584",2698059,2700530,"I know what I have to do. What?","Matrix Revolutions"
"585",2700590,2703719,"There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"586",2703809,2705679,"I have to take one of the ships.","Matrix Revolutions"
"587",2705690,2708019,"What? To go where?","Matrix Revolutions"
"588",2709420,2711699,"To the machine city.","Matrix Revolutions"
"589",2714989,2717639,"I know it's difficult to understand.","Matrix Revolutions"
"590",2717710,2720650,"No, It's not, you're out of your goddamn mind.","Matrix Revolutions"
"591",2720659,2723639,"I still have to go. You'll never make it. In 100 years...","Matrix Revolutions"
"592",2723719,2725849,"...no ship has been within a hundred kilometers of it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"593",2725860,2728170,"You'll never make it. I have to try.","Matrix Revolutions"
"594",2728349,2730389,"Is this what the Oracle has told you?","Matrix Revolutions"
"595",2730699,2731769,"No.","Matrix Revolutions"
"596",2732000,2735400,"This is asinine. If you wanna kill yourself, go do it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"597",2735400,2737500,"But do it without wasting one of our ships.","Matrix Revolutions"
"598",2737610,2739730,"You have to believe me, I have to go.","Matrix Revolutions"
"599",2739730,2740269,"Bullshit!","Matrix Revolutions"
"600",2740269,2743650,"I am the captain of this ship, I say where it has to go!","Matrix Revolutions"
"601",2743780,2748500,"And believe me, this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.","Matrix Revolutions"
"602",2751219,2753159,"He can take mine.","Matrix Revolutions"
"603",2753309,2755059,"You can't do that.","Matrix Revolutions"
"604",2756280,2759280,"Don't even think of trying to tell me what I can...","Matrix Revolutions"
"605",2759280,2761880,"...or cannot do with my ship after that little speech.","Matrix Revolutions"
"606",2761889,2766889,"But for Christ sake, Niobe. I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.","Matrix Revolutions"
"607",2766960,2770750,"If we leave inside the hour we should reach Zion as the machines do.","Matrix Revolutions"
"608",2770829,2772989,"That's as good a plan as any.","Matrix Revolutions"
"609",2773260,2776530,"It's a waste. A Goddamn waste.","Matrix Revolutions"
"610",2782480,2785039,"Two ships, two directions.","Matrix Revolutions"
"611",2785309,2789190,"Sounds like providence, doesn't it Morpheus?","Matrix Revolutions"
"612",2789750,2792230,"You've never believed in The One.","Matrix Revolutions"
"613",2792239,2795829,"I still don't. Then why are you doing this?","Matrix Revolutions"
"614",2796179,2798510,"I believe in him.","Matrix Revolutions"
"615",2799619,2800639,"Thank you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"616",2806840,2810019,"What's that for? To help you relax.","Matrix Revolutions"
"617",2810039,2812909,"Make it easier for you to remember.","Matrix Revolutions"
"618",2813360,2816519,"What if i don't want to remember?","Matrix Revolutions"
"619",2816630,2818849,"Why would you want that?","Matrix Revolutions"
"620",2818900,2821670,"What if I blew that EMP?","Matrix Revolutions"
"621",2823000,2826300,"What if I did destroy those ships and I am responsible...","Matrix Revolutions"
"622",2826309,2829809,"...for the deaths of all those men?","Matrix Revolutions"
"623",2832030,2838710,"If I did that, it wouldn't be very safe for me here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"624",2838710,2839760,"Would it?","Matrix Revolutions"
"625",2848900,2853250,"Of course it might not be very safe for you, either.","Matrix Revolutions"
"626",2860889,2862900,"I'm ready.","Matrix Revolutions"
"627",2864119,2865250,"Trinity.","Matrix Revolutions"
"628",2867050,2869650,"There's something I have to say.","Matrix Revolutions"
"629",2872750,2875429,"There's something you need to understand.","Matrix Revolutions"
"630",2876719,2879599,"I know I'm supposed to go.","Matrix Revolutions"
"631",2879750,2884860,"But beyond that... I don't know I...","Matrix Revolutions"
"632",2885659,2890360,"I know. You don't think you're coming back.","Matrix Revolutions"
"633",2891420,2894159,"I knew it the moment you said you had to leave.","Matrix Revolutions"
"634",2894280,2896559,"I could see it in your face.","Matrix Revolutions"
"635",2896590,2898889,"Just like you knew the moment you looked at me...","Matrix Revolutions"
"636",2898980,2902179,"...that I was coming with you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"637",2903769,2907550,"I'm scared Trin. So am I.","Matrix Revolutions"
"638",2908590,2912570,"It took me ten minutes to buckle up one boot.","Matrix Revolutions"
"639",2913170,2916699,"But I'll tell you something. Six hours ago...","Matrix Revolutions"
"640",2916849,2918849,"...I told the Merovingian I was ready...","Matrix Revolutions"
"641",2918860,2922440,"...to give anything and everything for you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"642",2924429,2927019,"You know what's changed in the last 6 hours?","Matrix Revolutions"
"643",2927119,2927989,"No.","Matrix Revolutions"
"644",2928420,2931940,"Nothing.","Matrix Revolutions"
"645",2943739,2946230,"Have you finished loading that amunition? Just about, sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"646",2946280,2948789,"Lets move it, we're out of time.","Matrix Revolutions"
"647",2948840,2951090,"You're not leaving them anything?","Matrix Revolutions"
"648",2951179,2953289,"He said he didn't need it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"649",2956610,2961280,"I ain't saying goodbye, I'm saying good luck.","Matrix Revolutions"
"650",2961320,2962409,"Thank you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"651",2967869,2970389,"I can only hope you know what you're doing.","Matrix Revolutions"
"652",2970460,2972530,"Me too.","Matrix Revolutions"
"653",2976429,2979710,"It was an honour, Sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"654",2981449,2985969,"No, the honour's still mine.","Matrix Revolutions"
"655",2998250,2999360,"We're ready sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"656",2999489,3001449,"'Bout damn time.","Matrix Revolutions"
"657",3002489,3006000,"We're already late Captain, so lets hit it and hit it hard.","Matrix Revolutions"
"658",3009610,3014039,"Bye baby, take good care of them.","Matrix Revolutions"
"659",3035309,3037139,"Ready?","Matrix Revolutions"
"660",3045179,3046889,"Engine's still firing.","Matrix Revolutions"
"661",3047150,3050780,"Must be a fuse, I'll check it out.","Matrix Revolutions"
"662",3064010,3067010,"I should've known he'd send his bitch first.","Matrix Revolutions"
"663",3067010,3067510,"Bane!","Matrix Revolutions"
"664",3067739,3071070,"No one ever got away from me as many times as you did.","Matrix Revolutions"
"665",3071170,3073219,"Every single time I thought it was the last.","Matrix Revolutions"
"666",3073260,3076860,"Everytime I was sure we had you, but somehow you'd slip through our fingers.","Matrix Revolutions"
"667",3077010,3082030,"I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.","Matrix Revolutions"

"672",3114190,3115980,"27 kilometers to go.","Matrix Revolutions"
"673",3116039,3118530,"Captain, we got an emergency down here. What is it AK?","Matrix Revolutions"
"674",3118550,3119780,"It's Maggie, sir.","Matrix Revolutions"
"675",3119829,3120960,"She's dead.","Matrix Revolutions"
"676",3121039,3124070,"Murdered. I think it was Bane. Goddamn it.","Matrix Revolutions"

"684",3148789,3150739,"It's too dangerous. Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"685",3150800,3154329,"Because if he's killed them, he will control another EMP.","Matrix Revolutions"

"709",3253309,3258119,"I admit, it's difficult to even think, encased in this rotting piece of meat.","Matrix Revolutions"
"710",3258130,3264269,"The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.","Matrix Revolutions"
"711",3266610,3267769,"Disgusting.","Matrix Revolutions"
"712",3268650,3271380,"Look at how pathetically fragile it is.","Matrix Revolutions"

"934",5098850,5100590,"That is correct, Councillor, I did.","Matrix Revolutions"
"935",5101239,5103989,"Knowing what he planned to do with it?","Matrix Revolutions"
"936",5104520,5107350,"And the Oracle said nothing of this?","Matrix Revolutions"
"937",5107489,5110340,"She told me that Neo would need my help and when the time came...","Matrix Revolutions"
"938",5110340,5112329,"...I would choose to help him or not.","Matrix Revolutions"

"940",5116920,5118760,"None, it's completely impossible.","Matrix Revolutions"

"942",5120489,5124239,"He wouldn't even take any ammunition. He was totally out of his goddamn mind.","Matrix Revolutions"
"943",5124619,5127489,"No, he wasn't.","Matrix Revolutions"

"964",5274649,5276930,"What do we do now, Commander?","Matrix Revolutions"
"965",5280439,5281710,"It's now a matter of time.","Matrix Revolutions"
"966",5283479,5286779,"Machines will breach the walls of the city.","Matrix Revolutions"
"967",5287270,5291689,"I recommend that the Council join the rest of the non-military personnel inside the Temple.","Matrix Revolutions"

"972",5307770,5311529,"Commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving?","Matrix Revolutions"
"973",5313000,5316300,"If I were you, Councillor, I wouldn't ask me that question.","Matrix Revolutions"
"974",5316560,5317560,"I would ask him.","Matrix Revolutions"
"975",5318289,5319220,"Why?","Matrix Revolutions"
"976",5319989,5324119,"Because he's the one who believes in miracles.","Matrix Revolutions"
"977",5329819,5332010,"There, those mountains.","Matrix Revolutions"
"978",5332970,5334159,"That's it.","Matrix Revolutions"

"982",5347710,5349619,"We have to.","Matrix Revolutions"
"983",5422630,5424680,"Sentinels!","Matrix Revolutions"
"984",5435710,5437779,"There's too many.","Matrix Revolutions"

"986",5456340,5458010,"Come on, Neo, I need help here!","Matrix Revolutions"
"987",5458010,5459479,"I can't beat them.","Matrix Revolutions"
"988",5459560,5460899,"What'll we do? Go up!","Matrix Revolutions"

"990",5462140,5463340,"The sky.","Matrix Revolutions"
"991",5463340,5464920,"It's the only way.","Matrix Revolutions"
"992",5466050,5468119,"Then up we go.","Matrix Revolutions"
"993",5502970,5504460,"Beautiful.","Matrix Revolutions"
"994",5526979,5529800,"Pump the igniter, the ship will start.","Matrix Revolutions"

"1002",5581250,5582090,"Here.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1003",5592560,5594189,"We made it.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1004",5595899,5597760,"You said we would.","Matrix Revolutions"

"1011",5621750,5624470,"I can't go with you Neo.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1012",5625880,5628149,"I've gone as far as I can.","Matrix Revolutions"

"1085",6298270,6300600,"Closing in on you.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1086",6300899,6302699,"Oh, I can.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1087",6304380,6308489,"I really should thank you for it, after all, it was your life...","Matrix Revolutions"

"1092",6538069,6539529,"Why do you do it?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1093",6540180,6542079,"Why? Why get up?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1094",6542270,6544829,"Why keep fighting?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1095",6545890,6550909,"Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1096",6551229,6555229,"Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1097",6557939,6559810,"Is it freedom or truth?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1098",6559890,6562229,"Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?","Matrix Revolutions"
"1099",6562430,6566039,"Illusions Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1100",6566210,6570939,"Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify...","Matrix Revolutions"
"1101",6570979,6574270,"...an existance that is without meaning or purpose.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1102",6574420,6578119,"And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1103",6578239,6583800,"Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1104",6586829,6588859,"You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.","Matrix Revolutions"
"1105",6588930,6590270,"You must know it by now!","Matrix Revolutions"
"1106",6590350,6593539,"You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting!","Matrix Revolutions"

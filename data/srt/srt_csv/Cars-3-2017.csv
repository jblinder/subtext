"1114",3816391,3817851,"Guido, she's an angel.","Cars 3"
"1115",3819184,3820686,"Lou won't admit this,","Cars 3"
"1116",3820769,3824231,"but she used to have serious eyes for Hud.","Cars 3"
"1117",3824815,3825858,"Oh, really?","Cars 3"
"1118",3825983,3827777,"Even if I did, it wouldn't have mattered.","Cars 3"
"1119",3827943,3830655,"Hud didn't like fast women.And that left me out.","Cars 3"
"1120",3831864,3834492,"Old Lou wasn't just fast, she was fearless.","Cars 3"
"1121",3834742,3837829,"The second I saw my first race,I just knew I had to get in there.","Cars 3"
"1122",3837996,3842416,"Of course, the fellas in chargedidn't like a lady racer showin' them up.","Cars 3"
"1123",3842583,3844126,"So they wouldn't let me have a number.","Cars 3"
"1124",3844376,3845545,"What did you do?","Cars 3"
"1125",3845836,3847047,"I stole one!","Cars 3"
"1126",3847255,3848340,"- What?- Wow.","Cars 3"
"1127",3848715,3851509,"Life's too short to take nofor an answer. Right, River?","Cars 3"
"1128",3851675,3854554,"If we had waited for an invitation,we might've never raced.","Cars 3"
"1129",3854721,3857139,"And once we got on the track,we didn't want to leave.","Cars 3"
"1130",3857349,3858932,"I think that's how Doc felt too.","Cars 3"
"1131",3859141,3861186,"You should've seen himwhen he first came to town.","Cars 3"
"1132",3861268,3863103,"Shiny blue paint.","Cars 3"
"1133",3863271,3864646,"Not just the Hudson Hornet.","Cars 3"

"1138",3872489,3873489,"Not for long.","Cars 3"
"1139",3873572,3876451,"Hud was the fastest racerthis side of the Mississippi.","Cars 3"
"1140",3876742,3878077,"Until he wasn't.","Cars 3"
"1141",3878577,3879579,"What?","Cars 3"
"1142",3880746,3883083,"Everything changed when the rookie showed up.","Cars 3"
"1143",3889672,3892675,"Took Hud all of no time to workhis way through the best racers...","Cars 3"
"1144",3892759,3894344,"in both Carolinas.","Cars 3"
"1145",3895260,3899099,"Past River. Past Lou. Even Junior.","Cars 3"
"1146",3901351,3903311,"But there was still the rookie to deal with.","Cars 3"
"1147",3906481,3908190,"Tried slamming him into the wall.","Cars 3"
"1148",3910110,3912862,"But Hud never touched any wall,","Cars 3"
"1149",3912987,3914114,"unless he wanted to.","Cars 3"
"1150",3925125,3928168,"That rookie never sawanything like that before.","Cars 3"
"1151",3928335,3930547,"- Doc did that?- Whoa! Are you kidding?","Cars 3"
"1152",3930797,3933882,"Couldn't wipe the smile off his facefor a week after that.","Cars 3"
"1153",3935885,3937971,"I wish I could've seen him like that.","Cars 3"
"1154",3939139,3942016,"- Like what?- So happy.","Cars 3"
"1155",3949190,3952152,"You didn't come all this wayfor a quart of oil, did you?","Cars 3"
"1156",3953485,3955362,"I need your help, Smokey.","Cars 3"
"1157",3956072,3958532,"Yeah? What kind of help?","Cars 3"
"1158",3959867,3962954,"That's just it, I'm not sure.","Cars 3"
"1159",3963036,3965081,"All I know is if I lose in Florida...","Cars 3"
"1160",3966331,3968041,"it's over for me.","Cars 3"
"1161",3968126,3970335,"What happened to Doc will happen to me.","Cars 3"
"1162",3971503,3973172,"What did happen to him?","Cars 3"
"1163",3974507,3978552,"You know,racing was the best part of his life.","Cars 3"
"1164",3978719,3980429,"And when it ended, he...","Cars 3"
"1165",3981764,3984224,"Well, we both know he wasnever the same after that.","Cars 3"
"1166",3986226,3987853,"Is that what you think?","Cars 3"
"1167",3989856,3992525,"Come on. I want to show you something.","Cars 3"
"1168",3998530,4000449,"You got the first part right.","Cars 3"
"1169",4001117,4003286,"The crash broke Hud's body","Cars 3"
"1170",4003369,4005538,"and the ""no more racing"" broke his heart.","Cars 3"
"1171",4006206,4007581,"He cut himself off.","Cars 3"
"1172",4007664,4009626,"Disappeared to Radiator Springs.","Cars 3"
"1173",4009791,4012878,"Son of a gun didn't talk to me for 50 years.","Cars 3"
"1174",4013545,4017300,"But then one day,the letters started coming in.","Cars 3"
"1175",4029844,4032556,"And every last one of them was about you.","Cars 3"
"1176",4035434,4038519,"Yeah, Hud loved racing.","Cars 3"
"1177",4039563,4040731,"But coaching you?","Cars 3"
"1178",4041690,4044568,"I had never seen the old grump so happy.","Cars 3"
"1179",4048614,4051574,"Racing wasn't the best part of Hud's life.","Cars 3"

"1185",4083934,4085936,"You got a lot of stuff, kid.","Cars 3"
"1186",4102036,4106123,"Hud saw something in youthat you don't even see in yourself.","Cars 3"

"178",1109508,1113467,"He's lonely. He hasn't got any friendsbut me, and maybe you.","Stage Fright"
"179",1113645,1116773,"- You will help him, won't you?- He hasn't got me...","Stage Fright"
"180",1116948,1118279,"...yet.","Stage Fright"
"181",1120385,1124082,"You're just dying to get into a part of this,and you know you are.","Stage Fright"
"182",1124256,1126816,"A part in this melodramatic play,you mean?","Stage Fright"
"183",1126992,1128789,"That's the way you're treating it, Eve.","Stage Fright"
"184",1128960,1131758,"As though it were a playyou were acting in at the Academy.","Stage Fright"
"185",1131930,1135798,"Everything seems a fine acting rolewhen you're stage-struck...","Stage Fright"
"186",1135967,1137730,"...doesn't it, my dear?","Stage Fright"
"187",1137903,1141361,"Here you have a plot,an interesting cast...","Stage Fright"
"188",1141540,1145499,"...even a costume,little the worse for wear.","Stage Fright"
"189",1145677,1149238,"Unfortunately, Eve,in this real and earnest life...","Stage Fright"
"190",1149414,1152906,"...we must face the situationand all its bearings.","Stage Fright"
"191",1153118,1154847,"Yes.","Stage Fright"
"192",1155587,1156815,"What do you mean?","Stage Fright"
"193",1156988,1161254,"Well, Miss Charlotte Inwoodappears to be an expert in garden paths.","Stage Fright"
"194",1161426,1164452,"I think she's led your young friendup the garden path.","Stage Fright"
"195",1164629,1166995,"I think we should hesitatebefore we follow him.","Stage Fright"
"196",1167165,1169258,"- But why?- I don't know how this bloodstain...","Stage Fright"
"197",1169434,1173495,"...got onto this dress, but I do know thatsomebody smeared it on deliberately.","Stage Fright"
"198",1173672,1175162,"But why should they do that?","Stage Fright"
"199",1175340,1178798,"Well, Miss Inwood is an actress,a very good one.","Stage Fright"
"200",1178977,1181275,"She has an eyefor an emotional situation.","Stage Fright"
"201",1181446,1184677,"Supposing she wanted our somnolentyoung friend to go to her house...","Stage Fright"
"202",1184850,1186283,"...and be spotted there.","Stage Fright"
"203",1186451,1190410,"Well, this sanguinary garmentwould provide a very plausible reason.","Stage Fright"
"204",1190589,1193080,"A very plausible reason indeed.","Stage Fright"
"205",1193258,1196716,"So that's why she didn't change her dressbefore she went to his rooms.","Stage Fright"
"206",1196895,1199955,"Well, I cannot imagine Miss Inwoodgoing to see her young man...","Stage Fright"
"207",1200132,1203624,"Or your young man, whose ever young manhe is, in this nasty, messy condition.","Stage Fright"
"208",1203802,1207533,"No. This dress is a clue, my dear,a very important clue.","Stage Fright"
"209",1207706,1210732,"And though it grieves me, of all people,to have to say it, Eve...","Stage Fright"
"210",1210909,1213343,"...I think we should go to the police.","Stage Fright"
"211",1215914,1218405,"Jonathan! Jonathan, wake up.","Stage Fright"
"212",1218583,1221177,"Jonathan, how far do you thinkyou could trust Charlotte?","Stage Fright"

"214",1223822,1226256,"This bloodstain was put here deliberately.","Stage Fright"
"215",1226424,1230155,"Don't be ridiculous. You're trying to turn meagainst Charlotte, but you can't.","Stage Fright"
"216",1230328,1233764,"What's this doing here, anyhow?It should have been destroyed hours ago!","Stage Fright"
"217",1233932,1236457,"Fool! There goes the evidencethat could've helped you.","Stage Fright"

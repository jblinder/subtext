"49",260893,263487,"Well, I always kind of wantedto write a book...","Before Sunset"
"50",263653,267168,"...that all took placewithin the space of a pop song.","Before Sunset"
"51",267373,270365,"Like three or four minutes long,the whole thing.","Before Sunset"
"52",270573,273929,"The story, the idea,is that there's this guy, right...","Before Sunset"
"53",274133,276727,"...and he's totally depressed.","Before Sunset"

"58",289853,293084,"Everything that he needs.But that doesn't matter...","Before Sunset"

"60",296373,298523,"You know? Happinessis in the doing, right?","Before Sunset"
"61",298733,300928,"Not in the getting what you want.","Before Sunset"
"62",301133,304489,"So he's sitting there,and just that second...","Before Sunset"
"63",304653,308726,"...his little 5-year-old daughterhops up on the table.","Before Sunset"
"64",308893,312044,"And he knows that she shouldget down, because she could get hurt.","Before Sunset"
"65",312253,316769,"But she's dancing to this pop songin a summer dress.","Before Sunset"
"66",317373,319284,"And he looks down...","Before Sunset"
"67",319493,321882,"...and all of a sudden, he's 16.","Before Sunset"
"68",322693,327926,"And his high-school sweetheartis dropping him off at home.","Before Sunset"
"69",328093,331529,"And they just lost their virginity,and she loves him...","Before Sunset"
"70",331693,335481,"...and the same song is playingon the car radio.","Before Sunset"
"71",335733,338566,"And she climbs up and starts dancingon the roof of the car.","Before Sunset"
"72",338773,340252,"And now he's worried about her.","Before Sunset"
"73",340413,344531,"And she's beautiful, with a facialexpression just like his daughter's.","Before Sunset"
"74",344853,346923,"In fact, maybe that's whyhe even likes her.","Before Sunset"
"75",347133,349931,"You see, he knows he's notremembering this dance...","Before Sunset"
"76",350133,353682,"...he's there. He's there,in both moments, simultaneously.","Before Sunset"
"77",353893,357169,"And just for an instant,all his life is just folding in on itself.","Before Sunset"
"78",357373,359967,"And it's obvious to himthat time is a lie.","Before Sunset"
"79",362173,364528,"That it's all happening all the time...","Before Sunset"
"80",364693,368129,"...and inside every momentis another moment...","Before Sunset"
"81",368373,370125,"...all happening simultaneously.","Before Sunset"

"168",651293,653648,"You must have been so angrywith me. I'm so sorry.","Before Sunset"
"169",653813,656247,"I wanted to be there,more than anything in the world.","Before Sunset"
"170",656413,659052,"- Honestly, I swear...- You can't be angry, my grandmother...","Before Sunset"
"171",659213,662728,"I know. I honestly thought that somethinglike that might have happened.","Before Sunset"
"172",662893,664884,"I was definitely bummed, but...","Before Sunset"
"173",665053,668602,"Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchangedany phone numbers or any information.","Before Sunset"

"175",670853,673083,"- Nothing to go on.- I didn't know your last name.","Before Sunset"
"176",673253,676325,"Remember, we were both afraidif we started writing and calling...","Before Sunset"

"178",680053,681247,"No, it sure wasn't.","Before Sunset"
"179",681413,683165,"We wanted to pick upwhere we left off.","Before Sunset"
"180",683333,686564,"Which would have been fineif it had worked. Oh, well.","Before Sunset"
"181",687853,689332,"So...","Before Sunset"

"187",706053,709966,"I put up signs of my numberin the hotel in case you'd been delayed.","Before Sunset"
"188",710133,712647,"- I was a total dork.- Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?","Before Sunset"

"197",732173,734323,"He's never beeneast of the Mississippi.","Before Sunset"
"198",734493,738566,"Why didn't you put, ""Six months later,the French bitch didn't show up""?","Before Sunset"

"336",1147893,1150646,"...one night I heard some noiseon my fire escape...","Before Sunset"
"337",1150853,1153287,"...so I called 911,and the cops came eventually.","Before Sunset"

"339",1157453,1159842,"No, but it was a manand a woman officer.","Before Sunset"
"340",1160053,1161964,"I was explaining what I had heard...","Before Sunset"
"341",1162173,1164368,"...when the woman hadto go move the police car.","Before Sunset"
"342",1164533,1166171,"I was left alone with the male cop.","Before Sunset"
"343",1166333,1170611,"Right away he asked me if I had a gun,and I said, ""No, of course not.""","Before Sunset"
"344",1170813,1173566,"And he told me, ""Well, you betterthink about getting one.","Before Sunset"
"345",1173773,1176970,"This is America, not France. Okay?""","Before Sunset"
"346",1177133,1180125,"And I said to him, ""I have no ideahow to shoot a gun...","Before Sunset"

"348",1182933,1186562,"And that's when he pulled out his gun,like this, and he went:","Before Sunset"

"355",1208973,1212363,"The way that cop had pulled his gun out,and everything, right?","Before Sunset"
"356",1212573,1214325,"So I canceled my demandfor the gun...","Before Sunset"
"357",1214493,1217485,"...and I called the police and triedto complain about that cop.","Before Sunset"
"358",1217653,1220121,"- What happened with that?- It was so much paperwork...","Before Sunset"
"359",1220293,1223012,"...and then I got scared,with my shitty student visa...","Before Sunset"

"633",2035226,2039014,"When I'm having sex, I see myselfwalking down that street.","Before Sunset"
"634",2039186,2041017,"I swear. It's so weird, right?","Before Sunset"
"635",2041186,2045225,"- Is that street nearby? I mean, could...?- Could we? No.","Before Sunset"

"643",2063706,2065617,"I was much more hopeful and naive...","Before Sunset"
"644",2065786,2069904,"...but the core, and the way I wasfeeling things, is exactly the same.","Before Sunset"
"645",2070066,2072296,"It made me realizeI haven't changed much at all.","Before Sunset"
"646",2072466,2073899,"I don't think anybody does.","Before Sunset"
"647",2074066,2077695,"People don't want to admit it, but it'slike we have these innate set points...","Before Sunset"

"649",2081506,2082905,"- You believe that?- I think so.","Before Sunset"
"650",2083066,2086263,"I read this study where they followedpeople who'd won the lottery...","Before Sunset"

"652",2088386,2092379,"You'd think one extreme is gonna makeyou euphoric and the other suicidal.","Before Sunset"
"653",2092546,2095140,"But the study shows that,after about six months...","Before Sunset"
"654",2095306,2098457,"...as soon as people had gotten used totheir new situation...","Before Sunset"
"655",2098626,2100856,"...they were, more or less, the same.- The same?","Before Sunset"
"656",2101026,2104098,"Yeah. Like, if they were basicallyan optimistic, jovial person...","Before Sunset"
"657",2104266,2106985,"...they're now an optimistic, jovialperson in a wheelchair.","Before Sunset"
"658",2107186,2109063,"If they're a petty, miserable asshole...","Before Sunset"

"662",2118026,2119664,"No, come on, are you depressed now?","Before Sunset"
"663",2119826,2122021,"No, no, I'm not depressed.","Before Sunset"
"664",2122186,2124746,"But sometimes I worryI'll get to the end of my life...","Before Sunset"
"665",2124906,2128296,"...feeling I haven't done all I wanted to.- Well, what do you want to do?","Before Sunset"
"666",2128466,2130104,"I...","Before Sunset"

"675",2156106,2158495,"- All right.- That sounds terrible. No, no, no.","Before Sunset"
"676",2158666,2162420,"But I don't want to be one of thosepeople that don't believe in any magic.","Before Sunset"

"678",2164586,2166338,"- There we go.- That makes sense, right?","Before Sunset"

"684",2182066,2185263,"I've always felt there was some kind ofmystical core to the universe.","Before Sunset"
"685",2185426,2190420,"But, more recently, I've started to thinkthat, me, my personality, whatever...","Before Sunset"
"686",2190586,2193544,"That I don't have any permanentplace here, you know.","Before Sunset"
"687",2193706,2195298,"In eternity or whatever, you know.","Before Sunset"
"688",2195466,2199141,"And the more I think that, I can't gothrough life saying this is no big deal.","Before Sunset"
"689",2199306,2202662,"This is it. This is actually happening.What do you think is interesting?","Before Sunset"
"690",2202826,2204896,"What do you think is funny?What is important?","Before Sunset"
"691",2205106,2207301,"You know, every day's our last.","Before Sunset"
"692",2207666,2211022,"When I feel that way, I usuallycall my mom to tell her I love her.","Before Sunset"
"693",2211186,2212744,"- Yeah?- And she's always:","Before Sunset"
"694",2212906,2216865,"""Are you okay? Do you have cancer?Are you gonna commit suicide?""","Before Sunset"
"695",2217026,2219540,"It's almost not worth it.","Before Sunset"
"696",2220706,2223379,"So, what about us?","Before Sunset"
"697",2223546,2225980,"- What about us?- No, what I mean is...","Before Sunset"
"698",2226146,2229582,"...if we were both going to die tonight...- Like the apocalypse was coming?","Before Sunset"
"699",2229746,2233705,"No, that's too dramatic... But what ifjust the two of us were going to die?","Before Sunset"
"700",2233866,2235743,"I mean, would we talkabout your book?","Before Sunset"

"705",2244466,2246821,"I definitely wouldstop talking about my book.","Before Sunset"
"706",2246986,2249546,"- I would probably drop the environment.- Okay.","Before Sunset"
"707",2249706,2253494,"But I would still want to talk about,you know, the magic in the universe.","Before Sunset"
"708",2253666,2256738,"- I'd just want to do it from a...- What?","Before Sunset"
"709",2256906,2258464,"...a hotel room, you know...","Before Sunset"
"710",2258626,2262255,"...in between sessions of uswildly fucking until we die.","Before Sunset"
"711",2262426,2265145,"Wow. Well, why waste timewith an hotel room?","Before Sunset"
"712",2265306,2268582,"Why not do it right there on a bench?","Before Sunset"
"713",2269306,2271581,"Come here, come here, come here.","Before Sunset"
"714",2271746,2274055,"Okay. We're not gonna die tonight.","Before Sunset"
"715",2274226,2276182,"All right. Too bad. I'm sorry.","Before Sunset"
"716",2276346,2277825,"That was an extreme example.","Before Sunset"
"717",2277986,2280341,"- I'm sorry.- Okay.","Before Sunset"
"718",2280506,2282098,"What l... My point was, you know...","Before Sunset"
"719",2282266,2284985,"...to truly communicate withpeople is very hard to do.","Before Sunset"
"720",2285146,2287819,"No, I know, most of ourday-to-day exchanges...","Before Sunset"
"721",2287986,2289465,"Yeah, no, I mean...","Before Sunset"
"722",2289626,2292140,"...not to bring everything back to sex...- But why not?","Before Sunset"
"723",2292306,2295298,"No, this example, this friend of mine,she was talking about...","Before Sunset"
"724",2295466,2298378,"- She and her boyfriend... Problems in bed.- Right.","Before Sunset"
"725",2298586,2301942,"And how when they had been datingfor a year she started telling him...","Before Sunset"
"726",2302106,2304984,"...what he could do to please her more,and it freaked him out.","Before Sunset"
"727",2305146,2306420,"- Why?- Totally.","Before Sunset"
"728",2306626,2308537,"He thought it meanthe was a bad lover...","Before Sunset"
"729",2308706,2310503,"Maybe she shouldn't havewaited so long.","Before Sunset"
"730",2310666,2312941,"- After a year...- But men are so easily offended.","Before Sunset"
"731",2313106,2315495,"- What, more than women?- Definitely on that subject.","Before Sunset"
"732",2315666,2316985,"- You think so?- Yeah, yeah.","Before Sunset"
"733",2317706,2319742,"Well, maybe it's because, you know...","Before Sunset"
"734",2319906,2323785,"...men are easier to... To please.- To please?","Before Sunset"
"735",2323986,2326864,"- Well, I don't know.- Yeah, they are. They're definitely.","Before Sunset"
"736",2327066,2329102,"Anyway, this friend,she was telling me...","Before Sunset"
"737",2329266,2332781,"...next time she dates a man,she's gonna make a little questionnaire...","Before Sunset"
"738",2332946,2336256,"...about what they like and dislike...- What, written down, or out loud?","Before Sunset"
"739",2336426,2338098,"Yeah, mostly written down.","Before Sunset"
"740",2338266,2341781,"But it wouldn't be just yes or no.It would be a bit more complex than that.","Before Sunset"
"741",2341946,2345302,"Like, for example, if the question is:""Are you into S & M?""","Before Sunset"
"742",2345466,2350096,"The answer could be: ""No, but a goodspanking once in a while doesn't hurt.""","Before Sunset"
"743",2350266,2353815,"Right, or like:""Do you like talking dirty in bed?""","Before Sunset"
"744",2353986,2357296,"- That kind of thing?- Yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.","Before Sunset"
"745",2357466,2359741,"Just ""What specific wordwould you like to hear?""","Before Sunset"

"751",2372706,2374298,"Good.","Before Sunset"
"752",2374466,2377344,"It's amazing what perverts we'vebecome in the past nine years.","Before Sunset"
"753",2377506,2380657,"At least now we don't have to pretendeach new sexual experience...","Before Sunset"
"754",2380826,2382464,"...is, like, a life-altering event.","Before Sunset"
"755",2382626,2385982,"I know. By now, you've stuck it inso many places it's about to fall off.","Before Sunset"
"756",2386146,2389695,"And I can't realistically expect you'vebecome anything but a total ho.","Before Sunset"

"839",2620146,2622023,"Oh, wow.","Before Sunset"
"840",2622186,2624780,"- Notre Dame, man. Check that out.- Oh, wow.","Before Sunset"
"841",2624946,2628780,"I heard this story once about whenthe Germans were occupying Paris...","Before Sunset"
"842",2628946,2630504,"...and they had to retreat back.","Before Sunset"
"843",2630666,2632543,"They wired Notre Dame to blow...","Before Sunset"
"844",2632706,2636779,"...but they had to leave one guyin charge of hitting the switch.","Before Sunset"
"845",2636946,2639904,"And the guy, the soldier,he couldn't do it.","Before Sunset"
"846",2640066,2643615,"He just sat there, knocked outby how beautiful the place was.","Before Sunset"
"847",2643786,2645583,"Then, when the Allied troopscame in...","Before Sunset"
"848",2645746,2649102,"...they found all the explosiveslying there and the switch unturned...","Before Sunset"
"849",2649266,2652781,"...and they found the same thingat the Sacr�-Coeur, Eiffel Tower...","Before Sunset"
"850",2652946,2655141,"...couple other places, I think.","Before Sunset"
"851",2655306,2657183,"Is that true?","Before Sunset"
"852",2657346,2660304,"I don't know.I always liked the story, though.","Before Sunset"
"853",2660466,2661785,"Yeah, that's a great story.","Before Sunset"
"854",2661986,2664739,"But you have to think that Notre Damewill be gone one day.","Before Sunset"
"855",2664906,2667943,"There used to be another churchat the Seine, right there.","Before Sunset"
"856",2668106,2670825,"- What, right in the same spot?- Yeah.","Before Sunset"
"857",2672226,2674581,"You know, this is great.I've never done this.","Before Sunset"
"858",2674746,2677260,"- Yeah.- I forget about how beautiful Paris is.","Before Sunset"
"859",2677426,2678984,"It's not so bad, being a tourist.","Before Sunset"
"860",2679146,2681535,"- Thanks for getting me on the boat.- You're welcome.","Before Sunset"
"861",2681706,2684504,"I think that book that I wrotewas like building something...","Before Sunset"
"862",2684986,2688979,"...so that I wouldn't forget the detailsof the time that we spent together.","Before Sunset"
"863",2689186,2692781,"You know, like, just as a reminder,that once, we really did meet.","Before Sunset"
"864",2692946,2695779,"You know, that this was real,this happened.","Before Sunset"
"865",2695946,2697857,"I'm happy you're saying that,because...","Before Sunset"
"866",2698026,2702144,"I mean, I always feel like a freak becauseI'm never able to move on like this:","Before Sunset"
"867",2703226,2706377,"People just have an affair,or even entire relationships...","Before Sunset"
"868",2706586,2708861,"...they break up and they forget.","Before Sunset"
"869",2709026,2712735,"They move on like they would havechanged brand of cereals.","Before Sunset"
"870",2713346,2716463,"I feel I was never able to forgetanyone I've been with...","Before Sunset"
"871",2716626,2721984,"...because each person had their ownspecific qualities.","Before Sunset"
"872",2722146,2726776,"You can never replace anyone.What is lost is lost.","Before Sunset"
"873",2727906,2731899,"Each relationship, when it ends,really damages me. I never fully recover.","Before Sunset"
"874",2732066,2735103,"That's why I'm very carefulwith getting involved...","Before Sunset"
"875",2735266,2737222,"...because it hurts too much.","Before Sunset"
"876",2737386,2740423,"Even getting laid,I actually don't do that...","Before Sunset"
"877",2740586,2743384,"...because I will miss of the personthe most mundane things.","Before Sunset"
"878",2743546,2746140,"Like I'm obsessed with little things.","Before Sunset"
"879",2746466,2748696,"Maybe I'm crazy,but when I was a little girl...","Before Sunset"
"880",2748866,2751664,"...my mom told methat I was always late to school.","Before Sunset"
"881",2751826,2754101,"One day she followed me to see why.","Before Sunset"
"882",2754306,2758424,"I was looking at chestnuts falling fromthe trees, rolling on the sidewalk...","Before Sunset"
"883",2758586,2764104,"...or ants crossing the road, the waya leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk.","Before Sunset"
"884",2764266,2766222,"Little things.","Before Sunset"
"885",2766706,2768458,"I think it's the same with people.","Before Sunset"
"886",2768946,2771744,"I see in them little details,so specific to each of them...","Before Sunset"
"887",2771906,2775865,"...that move me and that I missand will always miss.","Before Sunset"
"888",2776026,2777459,"You can never replace anyone...","Before Sunset"
"889",2777626,2781414,"...because everyone is made of suchbeautiful, specific details.","Before Sunset"
"890",2784746,2787897,"Like, I remember the way your beardhas a bit of red in it...","Before Sunset"
"891",2788626,2791186,"...and how the sunwas making it glow...","Before Sunset"
"892",2791386,2794059,"...that morning right before you left.","Before Sunset"
"893",2794946,2798700,"I remembered that, and I missed it.","Before Sunset"
"894",2798866,2800140,"Really crazy, right?","Before Sunset"
"895",2800746,2804500,"Now I know for sure. You wannaknow why I wrote that stupid book?","Before Sunset"
"896",2804706,2807504,"- Why?- So you'd come to a reading in Paris...","Before Sunset"
"897",2807706,2811699,"...and I could walk up to you and ask,""Where the fuck were you?""","Before Sunset"
"898",2812106,2814222,"No... You think I'd be here today?","Before Sunset"
"899",2814386,2818743,"I'm serious. I think I wrote it,in a way, to try to find you.","Before Sunset"
"900",2818946,2820937,"Okay, that's... I know that's not true...","Before Sunset"
"901",2821106,2823336,"...but that's sweet of you.- I think it is true.","Before Sunset"
"902",2823546,2825901,"What were the chancesof us ever meeting again?","Before Sunset"
"903",2826666,2829738,"After that December,I'd say almost zero.","Before Sunset"
"904",2830146,2832102,"But we're not real anyway, right?","Before Sunset"
"905",2832266,2835338,"We're just charactersin that old lady's dream.","Before Sunset"
"906",2835506,2837815,"She's on her deathbed,fantasizing about her youth.","Before Sunset"
"907",2837986,2839977,"So of course we had to meet again.","Before Sunset"
"908",2840146,2843900,"Oh, God. Why weren't you therein Vienna?","Before Sunset"
"909",2845026,2848621,"- I told you why.- I know why, I just...","Before Sunset"
"910",2848786,2850936,"I wish you would have been.","Before Sunset"
"911",2851106,2853256,"Our lives might have beenso much different.","Before Sunset"
"912",2853426,2855542,"You think so?","Before Sunset"
"913",2855706,2857264,"I actually do.","Before Sunset"
"914",2857466,2860458,"Maybe not. Maybe we would havehated each other eventually.","Before Sunset"
"915",2860666,2863419,"What, like we hate each other now?","Before Sunset"
"916",2864306,2868618,"You know, maybe we're...We're only good at brief encounters...","Before Sunset"
"917",2868786,2872825,"...walking around in European cities,in warm climate.","Before Sunset"
"918",2873306,2876298,"Oh, God. Why didn't weexchange phone numbers and stuff?","Before Sunset"
"919",2876466,2878536,"Why didn't we do that?","Before Sunset"
"920",2878706,2880981,"Because we were young and stupid.","Before Sunset"
"921",2881146,2883341,"Do you think we still are?","Before Sunset"
"922",2883506,2885542,"I guess when you're youngyou just believe...","Before Sunset"
"923",2885706,2888140,"...there'll be many peopleyou'll connect with.","Before Sunset"
"924",2888786,2891300,"Later in life you realizeit only happens a few times.","Before Sunset"
"925",2891466,2894936,"And you can screw it up, you know.Misconnect.","Before Sunset"
"926",2895146,2897455,"The past is the past.It was meant to be that way.","Before Sunset"
"927",2897626,2900186,"You really believe that?That everything's fated?","Before Sunset"
"928",2900346,2904180,"Well, you know, the world might beless free than we think.","Before Sunset"
"929",2904346,2905984,"Yeah?","Before Sunset"
"930",2906226,2909980,"When given these exact circumstances,that's what will happen every time.","Before Sunset"
"931",2910146,2913058,"Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,you'll get water every time.","Before Sunset"
"932",2913226,2916502,"No, I mean, what if your grandmotherhad lived a week longer, you know?","Before Sunset"
"933",2916666,2919180,"Or passed away a week earlier?Days, even?","Before Sunset"
"934",2919346,2920859,"Things might have been different.","Before Sunset"
"935",2921026,2925065,"- You can't think like that, it's...- You shouldn't on most things, but...","Before Sunset"
"936",2925226,2930220,"It's just, on this one, it seemed likesomething was off, you know.","Before Sunset"
"937",2930706,2934301,"In the months leading up to my wedding,I was thinking about you all the time.","Before Sunset"
"938",2934466,2938141,"Even on my way there, I'm in the car, abuddy of mine is driving me downtown...","Before Sunset"
"939",2938306,2940945,"...and I'm staring out the windowand I think I see you...","Before Sunset"
"940",2941106,2943176,"...not far from the church, right...","Before Sunset"
"941",2943346,2945735,"...folding up an umbrellaand walking into a deli...","Before Sunset"
"942",2945906,2949376,"...on the corner of 13th and Broadway.","Before Sunset"
"943",2949546,2952936,"And I thought I was going crazy.But now I think it probably was you.","Before Sunset"
"944",2953706,2956220,"I lived on 11 th and Broadway.","Before Sunset"
"945",2956986,2958783,"You see?","Before Sunset"
"946",2960026,2963621,"So, what is it like to be married?You haven't talked much about that.","Before Sunset"
"947",2964506,2967896,"I haven't? How weird.","Before Sunset"
"948",2968386,2972174,"I don't know. We met, you know,when I was in college.","Before Sunset"
"949",2972346,2978455,"And we broke up and got back togetherfor a period of years, and then...","Before Sunset"
"950",2979066,2983105,"What? We were sort of back togetherand she was pregnant...","Before Sunset"
"951",2983746,2985259,"...so marriage.","Before Sunset"
"952",2985426,2987382,"What is she like?","Before Sunset"
"953",2987546,2990458,"She's a great teacher, a good mom.","Before Sunset"
"954",2990626,2993538,"She's smart, pretty, you know.","Before Sunset"
"955",2993706,2995697,"I remember thinking at the time...","Before Sunset"
"956",2995866,2998141,"...that so many of the menthat I admired most...","Before Sunset"
"957",2998306,3002936,"...that their lives were dedicated tosomething greater than themselves.","Before Sunset"
"958",3003666,3006260,"So you got married becausemen you admired were married?","Before Sunset"
"959",3006426,3012422,"No, no. It's more like I had this...This idea of my best self, you know?","Before Sunset"
"960",3012586,3014258,"And I wanted to pursue that...","Before Sunset"
"961",3014426,3017065,"...even if it might have beenoverriding my honest self.","Before Sunset"
"962",3017226,3018579,"You know what I'm saying?","Before Sunset"
"963",3018746,3023103,"In the moment, I remember thinkingit didn't much matter, the who of it all.","Before Sunset"
"964",3023306,3025695,"I mean, that nobody is gonna beeverything to you...","Before Sunset"
"965",3025866,3028619,"...and that it's just the actionof committing yourself...","Before Sunset"
"966",3028786,3032142,"...you know, meetingyour responsibilities, that matters.","Before Sunset"
"967",3032306,3035776,"I mean, what is love, right,if it's not respect, trust, admiration?","Before Sunset"
"968",3035946,3038904,"And l... I felt all those things.","Before Sunset"
"969",3039066,3041819,"Cut to the present,and I feel like I'm running a nursery...","Before Sunset"
"970",3041986,3044546,"...with somebody I used to date,you know.","Before Sunset"
"971",3044706,3046458,"I mean, I'm like a monk, you know.","Before Sunset"
"972",3046626,3051302,"I mean, I've had sex less than 10 timesin the last four years.","Before Sunset"
"973",3051786,3054254,"- What, what? You laughing at me?- No.","Before Sunset"
"974",3054426,3057145,"- It sounds pathetic?- What monastery do monks have sex...?","Before Sunset"

"976",3060666,3063055,"But I do, I feel like if somebodywere to touch me...","Before Sunset"
"977",3063226,3065342,"...I would dissolve into molecules.","Before Sunset"
"978",3065506,3068145,"Well, we're here. We've gotta go.Come on.","Before Sunset"
"979",3068306,3070103,"Shit.","Before Sunset"
"980",3082106,3084939,"- I'm sorry to hear that, you know.- What?","Before Sunset"
"981",3085106,3088064,"You're not that happywith your marriage.","Before Sunset"
"982",3088226,3090786,"- This friend of mine, she's a shrink...- How's she doing?","Before Sunset"
"983",3090946,3092459,"She's a mess, but...","Before Sunset"
"984",3092626,3095743,"No, she said she's been dealingwith couples that are breaking up...","Before Sunset"
"985",3095906,3097976,"...for the same reason.- What reason is that?","Before Sunset"
"986",3098146,3100785,"They all expected, after a fewyears of living together...","Before Sunset"
"987",3100946,3103176,"...for the passion, that desire,to be the same.","Before Sunset"
"988",3103346,3104745,"- Yeah, right.- It's impossible.","Before Sunset"
"989",3104906,3106180,"And thank God...","Before Sunset"
"990",3106346,3109941,"...we'd end up with aneurysms in thatconstant state of excitement, right?","Before Sunset"
"991",3110106,3111824,"We'd do nothing at allwith our lives.","Before Sunset"
"992",3111986,3115342,"Would you have finished your bookif you were fucking every five minutes?","Before Sunset"
"993",3115506,3117974,"I might have welcomed the challenge,I mean...","Before Sunset"
"994",3118186,3120825,"It's natural for your wifeafter the birth of your son...","Before Sunset"
"995",3120986,3123500,"...to give all her love to the little one.- Of course.","Before Sunset"
"996",3123666,3126703,"If she was obsessed with sex,riding you like a wildcat...","Before Sunset"
"997",3126866,3128538,"That wouldn't make any sense, right?","Before Sunset"
"998",3128706,3132142,"Everything you're saying makes sense.It's not about sex.","Before Sunset"
"999",3132306,3134422,"No, I know. It's obvious.","Before Sunset"
"1000",3134586,3136099,"I...","Before Sunset"
"1001",3137186,3140258,"You know, couplesare so confused lately.","Before Sunset"
"1002",3140426,3142621,"I think it must be that...","Before Sunset"
"1003",3142786,3146574,"...men need to feel essentialand they don't anymore.","Before Sunset"
"1004",3146746,3149180,"It's been imprinted in their headfor so many years...","Before Sunset"
"1005",3149346,3150984,"...that they had to be the provider.","Before Sunset"
"1006",3151146,3154661,"Like, I'm a strong, independent womanin my professional life.","Before Sunset"
"1007",3154826,3156305,"I don't need a man to feed me...","Before Sunset"
"1008",3156466,3159663,"...but I still need a man to love meand that I could love.","Before Sunset"

"1022",3210186,3214418,"I was thinking, for me it's better I don'tromanticize things as much anymore.","Before Sunset"
"1023",3214586,3216383,"I was suffering so much all the time.","Before Sunset"
"1024",3216546,3219902,"I still have lots of dreams,but they're not in regard to my love life.","Before Sunset"
"1025",3220106,3222381,"It doesn't make me sad,it's just the way it is.","Before Sunset"
"1026",3222586,3226545,"Is that why you're in a relationshipwith somebody who's never around?","Before Sunset"
"1027",3226706,3230460,"Yes, obviously I can't deal withthe day-to-day life of a relationship.","Before Sunset"
"1028",3230626,3232617,"Yeah, we have thisexciting time together...","Before Sunset"
"1029",3232786,3236017,"...and he leaves and I miss him,but at least I'm not dying inside.","Before Sunset"
"1030",3236186,3238495,"When someone's always around me,I'm suffocating.","Before Sunset"
"1031",3238706,3241459,"No, wait, you just saidthat you need to love and be loved.","Before Sunset"
"1032",3241666,3244385,"Yeah, but when I do,it quickly makes me nauseous.","Before Sunset"
"1033",3244546,3245945,"It's a disaster.","Before Sunset"
"1034",3246106,3248666,"I mean, I'm really happyonly when I'm on my own.","Before Sunset"
"1035",3248826,3253502,"Even being alone, it's better than sittingnext to a lover and feeling Ionely.","Before Sunset"
"1036",3254146,3255977,"It's not so easy for meto be a romantic.","Before Sunset"
"1037",3256146,3259502,"You start off that way, and afteryou've been screwed over a few times...","Before Sunset"
"1038",3259666,3263818,"...you forget about your delusional ideasand you take what comes into your life.","Before Sunset"
"1039",3264466,3266855,"That's not even true.I haven't been screwed over...","Before Sunset"
"1040",3267026,3269335,"...I've just had too manyblah relationships.","Before Sunset"
"1041",3269506,3271258,"They weren't mean,they cared for me...","Before Sunset"

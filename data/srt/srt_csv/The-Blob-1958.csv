"480",2480127,2484188,"All we know is that they told us something had happened over at Dr. Hallen's house.","The Blob"
"481",2484264,2487028,"We're not accusing anyoneof what we found.","The Blob"
"482",2487100,2490934,"We can't be more definite until we contact Dr. Hallen in Johnsonville.","The Blob"
"483",2491004,2494371,"Dad, it isn't vandalism!Dr. Hallen is dead,","The Blob"

"493",2535382,2538909,"Maybe it's a good idea, son. We can talk about this some more at home.","The Blob"
"494",2538985,2540919,"Sure, Pop.","The Blob"
"495",2542489,2546152,"Get out of the house as fast as you can.I'll be over.","The Blob"
"496",2555836,2558270,"Maybe Bertie's right.","The Blob"
"497",2558338,2563275,"Maybe this is just a gag like those school fraternities were throwing last year.","The Blob"
"498",2563343,2567780,"Remember how they stitched that bathing suit to the statue of General Hayes?","The Blob"
"499",2569182,2571707,"I don't think this is a gag.","The Blob"
"500",2571785,2575118,"Why didn't you book the kids then?","The Blob"
"501",2575188,2579716,"Why make a big thing of it tonight if we can clear the whole thing up tomorrow?","The Blob"
"502",2579793,2583889,"Boy, if it was Bertie, he'd have themstrung up by the thumbs by now.","The Blob"
"503",2583964,2587092,"Maybe he would.","The Blob"
"504",2590036,2591970,"Police department.","The Blob"
"505",2592038,2594336,"Hold on. It's Bertie.","The Blob"

"516",2625105,2627733,"Bertie got some idea what this is?","The Blob"
"517",2627807,2630332,"I don't care what Bertie's ideas are!","The Blob"
"518",2630410,2633174,"He acts like we're still fighting the war.","The Blob"
"519",2633246,2636477,"Just because some kid smacks into his wife on the turnpike...","The Blob"
"520",2636550,2640281,"doesn't make it a crimeto be 17 years old!","The Blob"
"521",2642422,2646119,"Okay, so I don't know what the kids are up to tonight.","The Blob"
"522",2646192,2650185,"But I'm not gonna throw theminto a cell like a couple of vagrants.","The Blob"
"523",2650263,2652754,"We'll put this puzzle together in the morning.","The Blob"
"524",2652832,2655426,"In the meantime, at least we know where the kids are.","The Blob"
"525",2668448,2671679,"- Hey, where are you going?- Oh, shhh, Danny.","The Blob"
"526",2671751,2674618,"- Shhh.- Where are you going?","The Blob"

"528",2678758,2682250,"I won't tell anybody.I'll go with you.","The Blob"
"529",2682329,2685457,"No, honey, I have to go by myself.","The Blob"
"530",2685532,2689434,"- Will you be back pretty soon?- Well, I don't know.","The Blob"
"531",2689502,2693233,"Aren't you afraid to go out by yourself?","The Blob"
"532",2693306,2695467,"Yes, I guess I am, Danny.","The Blob"
"533",2695542,2698739,"I'm not afraid.I'll guard you.","The Blob"
"534",2698812,2701679,"Oh, no, Danny.You've got a bigger job to do.","The Blob"
"535",2701748,2704080,"You've got to stay hereand guard Mommy and Daddy.","The Blob"
"536",2704150,2706618,"Oh, they don't need guarding.","The Blob"
"537",2706686,2708745,"Oh, look, Danny, go on to beddie.","The Blob"
"538",2708822,2712451,"Look, if you go to bed, I might bring you a little dog all your very own.","The Blob"
"539",2712525,2714652,"A dog! Honest?","The Blob"
"540",2714728,2716855,"Honest.I cross my heart.","The Blob"
"541",2716930,2719865,"- Oh, boy!- Now go on up to bed.","The Blob"
"542",2721935,2725268,"- What's his name?- Oh, any name you want, Danny.","The Blob"
"543",2725338,2727272,"Can I name him William?","The Blob"
"544",2727340,2731868,"Oh, that's a fine name, Danny.Now you better run on up to bed.","The Blob"
"545",2731945,2735904,"- Go on.- Oh, I don't like William.","The Blob"
"546",2735982,2738974,"You run on to bed, honey.","The Blob"
"547",2741087,2745046,"Steve? Steve?","The Blob"
"548",2751031,2754296,"- Was he asleep?- Yeah.","The Blob"
"549",2754367,2756961,"Do you think he did something wrong?","The Blob"
"550",2757037,2759437,"I don't know. I don't think so.","The Blob"
"551",2759506,2762634,"The police don't either,or they wouldn't have sent him home.","The Blob"
"552",2762709,2765644,"I felt that he was keepingsomething from us.","The Blob"
"553",2765712,2769307,"He did seem more willing to talkwhen we were at the police station.","The Blob"
"554",2769382,2773978,"Well, I think tomorrow he might talk and we'll be able to straighten this out.","The Blob"
"555",2774054,2776989,"Maybe, after a good night's sleep.","The Blob"
"556",2777057,2779651,"Yeah. Good night.","The Blob"
"557",2779726,2781660,"'Night, dear.","The Blob"

"559",2817097,2819361,"Listen, Jane, I told you to wait over there.","The Blob"
"560",2819432,2822367,"The folks went to bed, so I thought I should just come on over.","The Blob"
"561",2822435,2824767,"All right, come on.Let's go around the corner.","The Blob"
"562",2836149,2838310,"- Steve?- Huh?","The Blob"
"563",2838384,2840375,"Oh, I'm sorry.","The Blob"
"564",2840453,2842851,"At least I could've thanked you for coming out tonight.","The Blob"
"565",2842973,2844389,"You didn't need to.","The Blob"
"566",2844457,2848052,"I never needed to talk to anyone before,not as much as I do now.","The Blob"
"567",2848128,2851461,"Well, we're in this together,aren't we, Steve?","The Blob"
"568",2853233,2855793,"You know, I wish that we...","The Blob"
"569",2858438,2862636,"I must be getting confused.","The Blob"
"570",2862709,2866873,"I know we saw the old man,I know we took him to the doc's...","The Blob"
"571",2866946,2870074,"and I know the doc sent us out to seeif we could find out what happened.","The Blob"
"572",2870150,2872414,"So?","The Blob"
"573",2872485,2875420,"And I know the old manhad something on his hand,","The Blob"
"574",2875488,2878753,"something he couldn't get off,something that kept getting larger.","The Blob"
"575",2878825,2880918,"I saw that.","The Blob"
"576",2880994,2885431,"And then I...I think I saw the doc.","The Blob"
"577",2885498,2888831,"He was standing by the window, and he...","The Blob"
"578",2888902,2891769,"he was trying to get out...","The Blob"
"579",2891838,2894432,"and that thing was all over him...","The Blob"
"580",2894507,2899444,"and then... just dissolved while I stood there.","The Blob"
"581",2899512,2902481,"I think I saw this.","The Blob"
"582",2902549,2904881,"I believe you did.","The Blob"
"583",2914861,2918797,"You know, plenty of people in their right mind thought they saw things that didn't exist,","The Blob"
"584",2918865,2920958,"you know, like flying saucers.","The Blob"
"585",2921034,2925130,"The light was just right,and the angle and the imagination.","The Blob"
"586",2925205,2930142,"Boy, if that's what it is,then this is just an ordinary night.","The Blob"
"587",2930210,2934078,"You and I are gonna go to sleep,and tomorrow when we get up...","The Blob"
"588",2934147,2938083,"that sun's gonna shine,just like yesterday.","The Blob"
"589",2938151,2940142,"Good old yesterday.","The Blob"
"590",2940220,2945089,"Steve, well, you believeyou did see it, don't you?","The Blob"
"591",2945158,2947149,"I don't know. I-I...","The Blob"
"592",2947227,2949821,"That's not true, Steve.","The Blob"
"593",2949896,2953764,"Well, maybe, maybe nowyou don't want to believe it.","The Blob"
"594",2953833,2957428,"Maybe you'd like to tell yourself it didn't happen.","The Blob"
"595",2957503,2961030,"But, Steve, you're not the kind of person who can turn your back...","The Blob"
"596",2961107,2964838,"on something you know is true.","The Blob"
"597",2964911,2966845,"I don't know.","The Blob"
"598",2966913,2969848,"Well, you actually did seewhat happened to Dr. Hallen.","The Blob"
"599",2969916,2971850,"How do you know I did?","The Blob"
"600",2971918,2975285,"Because I know you.","The Blob"
"601",2982629,2986895,"Okay.Now what do we do?","The Blob"
"602",2986966,2989958,"How do you get people to protect themselves from something they don't believe in?","The Blob"
"603",2990036,2993836,"Well, you keep tryingand hoping you can find...","The Blob"
"604",2993907,2997308,"some sort of proofthat'll convince them.","The Blob"
"605",2998778,3000712,"Okay.","The Blob"
"606",3000780,3002873,"I don't like it much,","The Blob"
"607",3002949,3006885,"but I guess the only way you can find that is to go out and look for it.","The Blob"
"608",3008821,3010880,"I'll go get the car.","The Blob"
"609",3063543,3066478,"- You sure you want to go with me?- Yes.","The Blob"
"610",3066546,3068946,"I wouldn't give much for our chances...","The Blob"
"611",3069015,3071950,"wandering around in the middle of the night trying to find something...","The Blob"
"612",3072018,3074452,"that if we found it,it might kill us.","The Blob"
"613",3074520,3077455,"If we could only finda couple of people to help us.","The Blob"
"614",3077523,3079787,"Hmm. Who?","The Blob"

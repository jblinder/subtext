"297",1256519,1258203,"Yes, she is, Superstar.","Rush"
"298",1258640,1261450,"Your brother and I got togetherwith the bean counters.","Rush"
"299",1261519,1262931,"And since the economics of F1","Rush"
"300",1263000,1266560,"are not so significantly differentto the economics of Formula 2,","Rush"
"301",1266640,1269040,"well, we thought if we weregoing to be losing money,","Rush"
"302",1269160,1272209,"we might as well be doing it onthe big roulette table in Formula 1.","Rush"
"303",1272279,1275602,"You fat, little, inbred beauty.Come here.","Rush"
"304",1279920,1283241,"Actually, credit where it's due,we got the idea from Niki.","Rush"

"317",1329000,1330763,"When the season started,people wondered","Rush"

"319",1334240,1338643,"were bringing glamourto the racing community, or just comedy.","Rush"

"331",1367799,1369403,"going on behind me towards the track,","Rush"
"332",1369480,1371881,"it is clearly a grave incident indeed.","Rush"
"333",1371960,1373371,"We will, of course,have more information for you","Rush"
"334",1373440,1374487,"as and when we get it,","Rush"
"335",1374599,1378605,"but it is the sight and soundof Formula 1 nobody likes to see.","Rush"

"508",2087079,2089844,"Right now,with zero incentive or reward,","Rush"
"509",2089920,2091684,"why would I drive fast?","Rush"

"518",2172199,2173724,"Goes wide at the exit.","Rush"
"519",2173920,2175409,"Hunt is past again.","Rush"
"520",2175440,2178523,"Once moreLauda tries to sneak up the inside.","Rush"
"521",2178599,2182605,"They're absolutely side by side,wheel to wheel.","Rush"
"522",2182679,2186730,"So evenly matched. Fantastic battlebetween these two great drivers.","Rush"
"523",2186760,2189126,"Hunt is now ahead once more.","Rush"
"524",2190599,2195242,"But Lauda's coming back again now.Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.","Rush"
"525",2195280,2197760,"And again he runs wide.Again the Hesketh...","Rush"
"526",2197920,2201083,"- Suzy, we're ready, come on.- Just... Just one second.","Rush"

"530",2210920,2212570,"And Hunt's got a problem!","Rush"
"531",2212639,2215085,"Hunt pulls across to the left.","Rush"
"532",2215119,2217963,"Lauda goes ahead on his own.","Rush"

"542",2297920,2300889,"Maybe the fact the car is so goodhas something to do with me.","Rush"
"543",2301000,2303889,"Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.I'm in a Hesketh.","Rush"

"545",2305960,2308405,"- I'd beat you and you know it.- Never.","Rush"
"546",2308519,2311409,"You might win one race, maybe two,because you're aggressive.","Rush"
"547",2311639,2314722,"But in the long run, over the courseof a season, no chance.","Rush"
"548",2314840,2315887,"Right. Why's that?","Rush"
"549",2316159,2318891,"Because to be a champion,it takes more than just being quick.","Rush"
"550",2319039,2320724,"- It's the whole picture.- Oh.","Rush"
"551",2320800,2322800,"You're just a charger and a party guy.","Rush"

"555",2331079,2333161,"All that affection, all those smiles","Rush"
"556",2333239,2335048,"- is a sign of disrespect.- Oh.","Rush"

"558",2337599,2340251,"Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.","Rush"
"559",2340360,2341929,"- Right.- Not even his own teammates.","Rush"
"560",2342000,2344764,"Right. Because I'm a serious guy.","Rush"
"561",2344880,2347280,"I go to bed early,I look after myself, look after my car.","Rush"
"562",2347400,2350449,"- Yes, you're very well-behaved.- Go to work, kick ass.","Rush"
"563",2350559,2353291,"And then, after the race,I go home instead of going to bars","Rush"
"564",2353400,2356528,"and talk all this bullshitwith all these assholes.","Rush"
"565",2356599,2358443,"Arseholes?","Rush"
"566",2358519,2360965,"You should go home more often, too.","Rush"

"570",2374239,2376242,"- In New York, working.- Oh.","Rush"
"571",2377639,2379608,"You know,I've never seen you with her once.","Rush"
"572",2379639,2380880,"No?","Rush"
"573",2383239,2386130,"Well, maybe that's becauseyou're always at home,","Rush"
"574",2386199,2390125,"on your own, looking after yourself,being a good little boy.","Rush"
"575",2394320,2395650,"Take a drink on me, James.","Rush"
"576",2397559,2400166,"Thank you, Niki. I might just have two.","Rush"
"577",2411519,2413010,"Right, Bubbles,","Rush"
"578",2413039,2416168,"whatever it takes to beatthat prick next year, just say it.","Rush"

"581",2423840,2425682,"What the hell's going on?","Rush"
"582",2427840,2430445,"Where is everybody? What's the matter?","Rush"
"583",2436039,2438519,"Do you know what the date is today?","Rush"
"584",2438599,2441045,"Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?","Rush"
"585",2441480,2445724,"Do you have any ideaof the significance of that date?","Rush"
"586",2447039,2450202,"I don't know.Time to start killing pheasants?","Rush"
"587",2452519,2455284,"Actually, it's the deadlinefor securing sponsorship","Rush"
"588",2455360,2457282,"for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.","Rush"
"589",2457519,2458965,"Yes?","Rush"
"590",2459159,2462130,"Which elapsed at midnight last night,and we didn't attract any.","Rush"
"591",2462519,2466081,"Well, so?We aren't looking for sponsorship.","Rush"
"592",2466159,2468447,"Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,vulgar, right?","Rush"
"593",2470400,2471606,"Right.","Rush"
"594",2473159,2475527,"Except we are, or were.","Rush"
"595",2478320,2480766,"I've made something of a miscalculation.","Rush"
"596",2481719,2485202,"The economics, Formula 1,realities thereof.","Rush"
"597",2486599,2489762,"It turns out,not like the lower divisions at all.","Rush"
"598",2492280,2494009,"What are you saying?","Rush"
"599",2495920,2498400,"I'm saying it's over, Superstar.","Rush"
"600",2499239,2502766,"The banks have stepped in,started laying everyone off.","Rush"
"601",2504559,2506960,"Probably have to sell this place.","Rush"
"602",2507559,2509561,"Oh, Christ.","Rush"
"603",2550199,2553965,"I need a drive, Pete.I need you to find me a drive.","Rush"
"604",2554400,2555925,"I mean, what about Lotus?","Rush"
"605",2557039,2558485,"You don't wanna know.","Rush"
"606",2558719,2561451,"- Actually, I do.- Okay. Uh...","Rush"
"607",2563800,2565802,"They felt your reputation preceded you.","Rush"
"608",2566119,2567804,"And what does that mean?","Rush"
"609",2569440,2572489,"It's my other line.Look, I'll get back to you.","Rush"
"610",2574400,2575481,"Peter Hunt.","Rush"

"612",2588239,2589684,"Don't worry. Something will turn up.","Rush"
"613",2598480,2600527,"Doubt that will help in the meantime.","Rush"
"614",2603480,2606130,"Why don't we go away at the weekend?","Rush"
"615",2606199,2609329,"Skiing. Before I go back to New York.","Rush"
"616",2612960,2616362,"Talk to me, James.Don't make a stranger of me.","Rush"
"617",2616480,2620485,"You know, Suzy,only a stranger would invite me skiing","Rush"
"618",2620519,2622965,"when they knowI haven't got a fucking drive.","Rush"
"619",2629360,2631123,"I can't watch this.","Rush"
"620",2631880,2634201,"What were you hoping for anyway?","Rush"
"621",2634679,2636967,"A well-adjusted knightin shining armour?","Rush"
"622",2637039,2638963,"No danger of that.","Rush"
"623",2639039,2641327,"- Let me give you some advice.- I'm all ears.","Rush"
"624",2641400,2644164,"Don't go to men who are willingto kill themselves driving in circles","Rush"
"625",2644239,2646891,"- looking for normality.- I never expected normality.","Rush"
"626",2647000,2649081,"God knows I walked into thiswith my eyes open.","Rush"
"627",2649159,2650650,"I just hoped I'd married someone","Rush"
"628",2650719,2653802,"who was half as impressiveon the inside as he is on the outside.","Rush"
"629",2653920,2655684,"At least there's somethingbehind the facade.","Rush"
"630",2655719,2657927,"- Oh, James.- Fuck off to New York, dear.","Rush"
"631",2659079,2661400,"There must be a moisturiseror an eye shadow somewhere","Rush"
"632",2661480,2663244,"that needs your vapid mush to flog it.","Rush"
"633",2699960,2701405,"- Hello?- Hi, James.","Rush"
"634",2701440,2704762,"It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.","Rush"
"635",2705360,2707362,"- What have you heard?- Nothing. Why?","Rush"
"636",2707440,2709965,"I heard Emerson's off.He's dumped them in it.","Rush"
"637",2710639,2712722,"Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.","Rush"
"638",2712800,2715201,"Say anything, just get me in that room.","Rush"
"639",2720119,2721884,"I'll come straight to the point.","Rush"

"643",2730159,2731650,"ASA-fucking-P.","Rush"
"644",2732639,2736485,"Fortunately, a few handshave already gone up, good people.","Rush"
"645",2737320,2740005,"- Jacky Ickx.- I'm quicker than Jacky.","Rush"
"646",2740440,2744331,"- But he's consistent, dependable.- A grown-up.","Rush"
"647",2744400,2747847,"Right, and will he go for that gapwhen no one else will?","Rush"
"648",2747960,2749927,"Will he put his life on the linethe day that it really matters?","Rush"
"649",2750239,2751684,"The sponsors like him.","Rush"
"650",2752159,2754360,"What do you want,a driver or a brush salesman?","Rush"
"651",2754400,2756320,"- We wanna be successful.- Yes, so do I.","Rush"
"652",2756599,2759523,"But that means beating Niki Lauda,not being a show pony for sponsors.","Rush"
"653",2759599,2761125,"I heard about this thing with Niki.","Rush"
"654",2761159,2762365,"Everyone has.","Rush"
"655",2763639,2766007,"- You really think you can beat him?- I'd beat him in a McLaren.","Rush"
"656",2766079,2769367,"It's the only car out thereas quick as the Ferrari.","Rush"
"657",2769679,2771681,"Which is why I'm here, begging.","Rush"
"658",2772159,2773605,"Look, I'll do whatever you ask.","Rush"
"659",2773679,2775523,"I'll put on a tie,I'll smile for sponsors,","Rush"

"662",2781000,2782889,"Just give me the drive.","Rush"
"663",2783599,2785489,"Yeah.Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.","Rush"
"664",2785679,2787284,"And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,","Rush"
"665",2787360,2790887,"but in terms of raw talentand right stuff,","Rush"
"666",2791000,2792889,"there is no better driver in the world.","Rush"
"667",2793280,2795442,"He's the real thing, Teddy.","Rush"

"669",2798159,2800161,"Nine days out of tenyou'll be pulling your hair out,","Rush"
"670",2800199,2803362,"but on that tenth day,James will be unbeatable.","Rush"
"671",2803400,2805402,"And that is the day you will wishyou had him in your car.","Rush"
"672",2805679,2808523,"You will never win the championshipwith Jacky Ickx.","Rush"
"673",2808880,2811246,"You just might with James.","Rush"

"808",3412920,3415490,"We haven't seenthis sort of intensity","Rush"

"834",3512320,3514447,"not all of which I'm preparedto discuss here -","Rush"
"835",3514480,3518804,"but justice being donere the disqualification in Spain helps,","Rush"

"837",3538320,3539969,"James! James!","Rush"
"838",3689480,3691686,"Welcome to the legendary Nurburgring.","Rush"
"839",3692440,3694282,"This is a 14.2-mile track,","Rush"
"840",3694760,3698128,"complete with 185 corners and bends.","Rush"
"841",3757079,3758922,"Welcome to the Nurburgring,","Rush"
"842",3759000,3761606,"the most dangerous circuiton the season calendar.","Rush"
"843",3761920,3764730,"In Formula 1 it is knownas the Graveyard.","Rush"
"844",3764840,3766568,"The weather conditionsare far from ideal,","Rush"
"845",3766679,3768250,"and latest reports indicate","Rush"
"846",3768360,3770010,"there is no relief in sight.","Rush"
"847",3774840,3779846,"Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,please be quiet.","Rush"
"848",3779920,3782081,"Thank you. Niki Lauda.","Rush"
"849",3782280,3783804,"Thank you.","Rush"
"850",3784679,3787922,"I called this meeting because,as all you drivers know,","Rush"
"851",3788039,3790202,"the Nurburgring is the most stupid,barbaric, outdated","Rush"
"852",3790239,3791730,"and dangerous track in the world.","Rush"
"853",3791760,3794047,"You've all seen the rainthat has been falling today.","Rush"
"854",3794079,3797721,"Now, those of you with experience knowthe ring needs perfect conditions","Rush"
"855",3797800,3800451,"to be even remotely acceptablein terms of risk.","Rush"
"856",3800559,3802927,"And today, with the rain,it's anything but perfect,","Rush"
"857",3803039,3806123,"so I called this meeting totake a vote to cancel the race.","Rush"
"858",3806199,3808282,"Cancel the race?","Rush"
"859",3808400,3810402,"There would be no changeto the situation","Rush"
"860",3810440,3811885,"as far as points is concerned.","Rush"
"861",3811920,3814570,"- The race would simply be cancelled.- This is bullshit.","Rush"
"862",3814639,3816880,"If the race is cancelled,none of us get our race fees.","Rush"
"863",3816960,3821329,"That's true, you leave without your fee,but you might leave with your life.","Rush"
"864",3821400,3825643,"It also means that you wouldeffectively win the championship.","Rush"
"865",3826079,3828606,"So, I can see whythis suits you just fine.","Rush"
"866",3829000,3831570,"Why? There would beno points for me either.","Rush"
"867",3831920,3834240,"No, but there would be one race less","Rush"
"868",3834280,3836646,"where I, or anyone else here,could catch you.","Rush"
"869",3836719,3839007,"James is right. This is just tactics.","Rush"
"870",3839079,3841764,"Maybe he's just frightened.","Rush"
"871",3843280,3844804,"Which asshole said this?","Rush"
"872",3850599,3853648,"Yes, of course I'm frightened,and so are you.","Rush"
"873",3855840,3859525,"I accept, every time I get in my car,there is 20 per cent chance I could die,","Rush"
"874",3859599,3861170,"and I can live with it,","Rush"
"875",3861280,3863282,"but not one per cent more.","Rush"
"876",3863320,3865641,"And today, with the rain,the risk is more.","Rush"
"877",3865760,3868490,"I suppose that all dependson how good you are in the rain.","Rush"
"878",3868960,3870802,"I have the track record here.","Rush"
"879",3870840,3873730,"I am the only person in historyto do the ring in under seven minutes.","Rush"
"880",3873800,3876485,"So, actually, it's to my advantageto race here today.","Rush"
"881",3878119,3880521,"Because I'm quicker than all of you.","Rush"
"882",3881559,3884847,"- Come on.- Fine. Then let's race.","Rush"
"883",3886480,3888847,"- Come on, Niki, let's race.- Gentlemen, please.","Rush"
"884",3888960,3890643,"Why are we here, Niki? Come on.","Rush"
"885",3896880,3899530,"Well, all those in favourof cancelling the race.","Rush"
"886",3909719,3911483,"All those in favour of racing.","Rush"
"887",3917880,3919324,"Gentlemen, the race is on.","Rush"
"888",3926159,3928320,"- Ridiculous.-  What a waste of time.","Rush"
"889",3929719,3932563,"You know, Niki, every now and thenit helps if people like you.","Rush"
"890",3948920,3951047,"In placesthe track is still dangerously wet,","Rush"

"900",3993800,3996280,"All right, fire her up.","Rush"

"697",3066537,3067579,"That's it.","42"
"698",3068122,3070165,"So I thought about it for a while...","42"
"699",3070332,3073335,"...and I looked up ""conspicuous""in the dictionary.","42"

"704",3096359,3099070,"You want to skip me on this one, Dix.I'm not interested.","42"
"705",3099237,3101364,"- What if they put him at shortstop?- Exactly.","42"
"706",3101531,3102657,"That's right, Pee Wee.","42"
"707",3102824,3104951,"Well, I figure if he's man enoughto take my job...","42"
"708",3105118,3106369,"- ...he deserves it.- Ugh.","42"
"709",3106536,3107871,"Oh, the hell he does.","42"
"710",3108037,3111541,"He does not have the ice waterin his veins to play big league baseball.","42"
"711",3111708,3113793,"- That's right.- So let him show what he's got.","42"
"712",3113960,3116504,"Robinson can either play or he can't.","42"
"713",3116671,3118549,"It'll all take care of itself.","42"

"742",3235169,3237171,"...or has stripes like a zebra.","42"
"743",3238840,3243386,"If Robinson can help us win,and everything I have seen says he can...","42"
"744",3243595,3247016,"...then he is gonna play on this ball club!","42"
"745",3247182,3252313,"Like it, lump it, make your minds up to it,because he's coming!","42"
"746",3257526,3261697,"And think about thiswhen your heads hit the pillows tonight.","42"
"747",3263657,3265242,"He's only the first, boys.","42"
"748",3266619,3268120,"Only the first.","42"
"749",3268746,3271248,"There are more coming right behind himevery day...","42"

"751",3275378,3278381,"Oh, yeah, they are gonnacome scratching and diving.","42"
"752",3278548,3281760,"So I would forget your petitionand worry about the field...","42"

"1551",6573634,6578931,"There was something unfairat the heart of the game I loved.","42"
"1552",6579140,6580475,"And I ignored it.","42"
"1553",6585146,6586898,"But a time came...","42"
"1554",6587815,6590151,"...when I could no longer do that.","42"
"1555",6593654,6595240,"You...","42"
"1556",6597785,6600370,"You let me love baseball again.","42"
"1557",6606043,6607336,"Thank you.","42"
"1558",6614802,6617554,"Last long road trip of the year.","42"
"1559",6618764,6621226,"And two long faces, huh?","42"
"1560",6636741,6638785,"Try not to lunge at the plate.","42"
"1561",6640703,6642163,"You serious?","42"
"1562",6642330,6645166,"That's why they're throwingthe fastballs inside.","42"
"1563",6646418,6648712,"Fight those inside fastballs off...","42"
"1564",6648879,6653134,"...sooner or later they won't be ableto help but throw a curve.","42"
"1565",6654385,6656720,"And what'll happen then, coach?","42"
"1566",6663727,6665563,"- Is that right?- Mm-hm.","42"
"1567",6666564,6670067,"Well, you know,if we win enough of these next games...","42"
"1568",6670568,6672320,"...we bring home the pennant.","42"
"1569",6673613,6675490,"You bring yourself home.","42"
"1570",6676575,6678201,"That'll be plenty.","42"
"1571",6679494,6681079,"You're in my heart.","42"
"1572",6684457,6687878,"Since the 4th of July, the BrooklynDodgers have gone on a hot streak...","42"
"1573",6688044,6690547,"...holding off all challengers.","42"
"1574",6690922,6692757,"During that timeand during this season...","42"
"1575",6692924,6695510,"...I have watched Jackie Robinsonsubmerge himself...","42"
"1576",6695677,6697345,"...to serve something greater.","42"
"1577",6699056,6702268,"And I don't mean the Brooklyn Dodgers,though he's doing that too.","42"
"1578",6703102,6706230,"The man flat-out has guts.","42"
"1579",6706397,6709692,"A stand-up force of nature,he's complicated everything but himself.","42"
"1580",6709859,6713279,"He's changing the worldand refusing to let it change him.","42"
"1581",6714864,6716741,"But baseball isn't tennis.","42"
"1582",6716949,6718659,"It takes a team.","42"
"1583",6719619,6721954,"Joining together was a start.","42"
"1584",6722121,6724291,"Staying together,a big step forward.","42"
"1585",6724458,6726627,"But working togetheris how you win.","42"
"1586",6726793,6728045,"Gut!","42"
"1587",6729838,6731798,"Jackie, you son of a gun,I could kiss you!","42"
"1588",6731965,6733133,"Nice catch.","42"
"1589",6733300,6734760,"Yours or mine? Heh.","42"
"1590",6735302,6737971,"Down the stretch on the lastlong road trip of the year...","42"
"1591",6738138,6741475,"...Jackie Robinson and the BrooklynDodgers are doing exactly that.","42"
"1592",6742309,6745562,"They're holding off the Cardinalsand streaking towards the pennant.","42"
"1593",6748315,6750818,"Boss, we did it.","42"
"1594",6750985,6753196,"We did it, we swept Cincinnati!","42"
"1595",6753363,6754781,"Great, Harold.","42"
"1596",6754948,6756824,"One more win could do it.","42"
"1597",6756991,6758993,"Who's pitching tomorrowfor the Pirates?","42"
"1598",6760161,6761829,"Ostermueller.","42"
"1599",6764582,6766501,"Fritz Ostermueller on the mound.","42"
"1600",6766668,6768336,"He's 12-8 on the season.","42"
"1601",6768503,6770713,"A big game today in Pittsburgh.","42"
"1602",6770880,6774092,"A win and the Dodgers will have clinchedthe National League pennant...","42"
"1603",6774259,6776845,"...Yankees having already clinchedin the American League.","42"
"1604",6777012,6778180,"There's bad blood here...","42"
"1605",6778347,6782017,"...as Ostermueller beaned Robinsonin the head earlier in the season...","42"
"1606",6782184,6784728,"...prompting quitea rhubarb at the time.","42"
"1607",6786438,6788357,"Teams have gonetheir separate ways since...","42"
"1608",6788524,6791026,"...with Ostermueller left standingin the Dodgers' way...","42"
"1609",6791193,6793779,"...as they chase the pennantthat eluded them last year.","42"
"1610",6793946,6795739,"Come on, Jackie, let's go!","42"
"1611",6800035,6801204,"Here comes the pitch.","42"

"1614",6807627,6809129,"And you never will.","42"
"1615",6809296,6810964,"Robinson crowding the plate.","42"
"1616",6811131,6813425,"Jack hasn't backed downto a pitcher all season.","42"
"1617",6813591,6814634,"There you go, Jackie!","42"
"1618",6814801,6819055,"You got nothing for him, Ostermueller!But he's got something for you!","42"
"1619",6821391,6823393,"Ostermueller winds and throws.","42"
"1620",6823560,6825353,"Low and away, ball two.","42"
"1621",6825603,6827606,"Fritz seemsto be pitching around Jackie...","42"
"1622",6827773,6830735,"...or as they say in the trade,trying to get him to chase.","42"
"1623",6830901,6832903,"Robinson's havinga fine rookie standard...","42"
"1624",6833070,6836115,"...batting .301 with 31 doublesand 10 home runs.","42"
"1625",6836282,6839410,"He has stolen 27 bases this seasonand has yet to be thrown out attempting.","42"
"1626",6841370,6843706,"Needless to say,Ostermueller being careful with him.","42"
"1627",6845750,6847460,"It's 3-0 now.","42"
"1628",6848002,6850921,"Robinson patient,waiting for something he can swing on.","42"
"1629",6851422,6852924,"Give me something.","42"
"1630",6854384,6855886,"Give me something I can hit.","42"
"1631",6856053,6857262,"You want it?","42"
"1632",6857429,6858972,"What are you afraid of?","42"
"1633",6868815,6870609,"What are you afraid of?","42"
"1634",6872652,6874446,"Ostermueller looking in for the sign.","42"
"1635",6874613,6877240,"Be careful what you ask for, boy.","42"
"1636",6882038,6883956,"And here comes the pitch.","42"
"1637",6887919,6890088,"Oh, and that's a deep fly ball to left.","42"
"1638",6890254,6892507,"Kiner on his horse,I don't think he'll get there.","42"
"1639",6892673,6894217,"Back, back, back, and...","42"
"1640",6894384,6896844,"Oh, ho, ho, doctor!","42"

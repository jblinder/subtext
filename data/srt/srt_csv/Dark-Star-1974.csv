"681",4449333,4452337,"I really don't know what the outsideuniverse is like at all, for certain.","Dark Star"
"682",4452417,4453839,"That's it! That's it!","Dark Star"
"683",4453917,4455169,"Intriguing.","Dark Star"
"684",4455250,4457048,"I wish I had more timeto discuss this matter.","Dark Star"
"685",4457125,4458718,"Why don't you have more time?","Dark Star"
"686",4458792,4460886,"Because I must detonate in 75 seconds.","Dark Star"
"687",4461083,4463336,"No, no, now, put it back!Put the gun back!","Dark Star"
"688",4463417,4465511,"You don't know what you are doing!","Dark Star"
"689",4469250,4470718,"Now, now give me the gun!","Dark Star"
"690",4470792,4472715,"You fool! I'm gonna shootthe pins out of the bomb","Dark Star"
"691",4472792,4474715,"and it will fall away from the shipand we'll be saved!","Dark Star"
"692",4474792,4477762,"Give me the gun, you don't know whatyou are doing? You're...","Dark Star"
"693",4479250,4481753,"You could have killed me...","Dark Star"
"694",4482250,4483376,"Now bomb,","Dark Star"
"695",4483458,4487213,"consider this next question,very carefully.","Dark Star"
"696",4487292,4491377,"What is your one purpose in life?- To explode, of course.","Dark Star"
"697",4491458,4494541,"And you can only do it once, right?- That is correct.","Dark Star"
"698",4494625,4497549,"And you wouldn't want to explode onthe basis of false data, would you?","Dark Star"
"699",4497625,4498717,"Of course not.","Dark Star"
"700",4498792,4502376,"Well then, you've already admittedthat you have no real proof of","Dark Star"
"701",4502458,4505541,"the existence of the outside universe.- Yes, well...","Dark Star"
"702",4505625,4509880,"So you have no absolute proof thatSergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.","Dark Star"
"703",4509958,4512882,"I recall distinctly the detonation order.","Dark Star"
"704",4512958,4514881,"My memory is good onmatters like these.","Dark Star"
"705",4514958,4516710,"Yes, of course you remember it, but...","Dark Star"
"706",4516792,4519545,"But all you're remembering is merely aseries of electrical impulses which","Dark Star"
"707",4519625,4524210,"you now realize have no real definiteconnection with, with outside reality.","Dark Star"
"708",4524292,4527216,"True, but since this is so,I have no proof that you are","Dark Star"
"709",4527292,4529044,"really telling me all this.","Dark Star"
"710",4534250,4536218,"That's all beside the point.","Dark Star"
"711",4536292,4538636,"I mean, the concept is valid,no matter where it originates.","Dark Star"
"712",4538708,4539709,"Hmmm...","Dark Star"
"713",4539792,4541385,"So if you detonate in...- 9 seconds.","Dark Star"
"714",4541458,4544382,"You could be doing soon the basis of false data.","Dark Star"
"715",4544458,4545880,"I have no proof that it was false data.","Dark Star"
"716",4545958,4548928,"You have no proof thatit was correct data.","Dark Star"
"717",4551250,4555926,"I must think on this further.","Dark Star"
"718",4561917,4564386,"Attention. Attention.","Dark Star"
"719",4564458,4567052,"The bomb has returnedto the bomb bay.","Dark Star"
"720",4567125,4570425,"The destruction sequence is aborted.","Dark Star"
"721",4594083,4598042,"Doolittle? Doolittle?","Dark Star"
"722",4598125,4601550,"What happened?Pinback? Boiler?","Dark Star"

"726",4624625,4628584,"You know, we've really gottadisarm the bomb.","Dark Star"
"727",4633083,4636053,"Hello, Doolittle, are you there?","Dark Star"
"728",4636125,4637547,"I'm coming in now.","Dark Star"
"729",4637625,4640048,"I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock.","Dark Star"
"730",4640125,4642719,"Too much trouble to comein the Dorsal Lock.","Dark Star"
"731",4642792,4645716,"Would you blow the seal on theemergency hatch so I can come in?","Dark Star"
"732",4645792,4647760,"Oh, sure.","Dark Star"
"733",4649792,4652420,"You are now leaving theEmergency Airlock.","Dark Star"

"736",4661000,4663503,"What's up, Doolittle?- Talby was in the air lock.","Dark Star"
"737",4663625,4667550,"You blew him out of the ship.He's drifting away without a jet pack.","Dark Star"
"738",4667625,4669002,"I'm going after him.","Dark Star"
"739",4669083,4671711,"Turn on his helmet radioso I can contact him.","Dark Star"
"740",4671792,4673385,"What? What's wrong? I didn't hear...","Dark Star"
"741",4673458,4676587,"Uh, Talby. He's drifting away fromthe ship without his jetpack.","Dark Star"
"742",4682917,4684043,"Talby,","Dark Star"

"750",4711625,4713548,"Hello, bomb.","Dark Star"
"751",4713625,4716219,"False data can act onlyas a distraction.","Dark Star"

"781",4821917,4823510,"I'm going right toward it.","Dark Star"
"782",4823792,4828423,"When you hit the atmosphere,you'll start to burn.","Dark Star"
"783",4829083,4833042,"What a beautiful way to die...as a falling star.","Dark Star"
"784",4833125,4836584,"Guess you're right.","Dark Star"

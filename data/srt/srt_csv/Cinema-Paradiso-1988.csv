"909",7000260,7003060,"But she might have broken her promise...","Cinema Paradiso"
"910",7003725,7008721,"and that would have been terrible. It would have killed him.","Cinema Paradiso"
"911",7008930,7012100,"This way, at least, for 99 nights...","Cinema Paradiso"
"912",7012159,7015095,"he had lived with the illusion that she was waiting for him.","Cinema Paradiso"
"913",7017119,7020520,"Do as the soldier did, Toto. Get out of here.","Cinema Paradiso"
"914",7021920,7023659,"This land is cursed.","Cinema Paradiso"
"915",7024960,7027573,"Living here day after day,","Cinema Paradiso"
"916",7027783,7030108,"you think it's the center of the world.","Cinema Paradiso"
"917",7031110,7034489,"You believe nothing will ever change.","Cinema Paradiso"
"918",7035247,7038417,"Then you leave for a year or two.","Cinema Paradiso"
"919",7039211,7043256,"When you come back, everything's changed.","Cinema Paradiso"
"920",7044479,7048970,"The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there.","Cinema Paradiso"
"921",7050079,7052306,"What was yours is gone many years.","Cinema Paradiso"
"922",7053350,7055007,"You have to go away for a long time...","Cinema Paradiso"

"931",7085256,7090185,"Life isn't like in the movies. Life...","Cinema Paradiso"
"932",7091760,7093060,"is much harder.","Cinema Paradiso"
"933",7095159,7101807,"Get out of here! Go back to Rome. You're young, and the world is yours.","Cinema Paradiso"
"934",7104108,7108800,"And I'm old. I don't want to hear you talk anymore.","Cinema Paradiso"
"935",7110198,7112108,"I want to hear others talking about you.","Cinema Paradiso"

"950",7353699,7354880,"- Toto.- How are you?","Cinema Paradiso"
"951",7368287,7373300,"Your sister will be so glad to see you. And the children...","Cinema Paradiso"
"952",7373460,7376399,"You won't recognize them, they've grown so much.","Cinema Paradiso"

"954",7380886,7385550,"We had the whole thing redone, all thanks to you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"955",7385649,7388965,"I have a surprise for you. Come.","Cinema Paradiso"
"956",7391229,7396484,"Are you tired? You have time to rest before the funeral.","Cinema Paradiso"
"957",7396693,7399000,"No, Mama, it's only an hour by plane.","Cinema Paradiso"
"958",7400359,7403386,"You shouldn't have said that after all these years.","Cinema Paradiso"
"959",7404076,7408372,"Come. I put all your things in here.","Cinema Paradiso"
"960",7515561,7518560,"He must be glad you came, Toto.","Cinema Paradiso"
"961",7520800,7523500,"He always talked about you. Always.","Cinema Paradiso"
"962",7525600,7531666,"Right up to the end.","Cinema Paradiso"
"963",7533412,7535086,"He really loved you.","Cinema Paradiso"

"966",7651159,7652000,"Hello.","Cinema Paradiso"
"967",7662560,7664060,"When did you close it down?","Cinema Paradiso"
"968",7665359,7668680,"Six years ago in May. Nobody came anymore.","Cinema Paradiso"
"969",7669659,7672551,"You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita--","Cinema Paradiso"
"970",7672761,7675359,"the economy, TV, videos.","Cinema Paradiso"
"971",7675560,7678359,"The old movie business is just a memory.","Cinema Paradiso"
"972",7679979,7683479,"The city bought the site for a parking lot.","Cinema Paradiso"
"973",7684500,7687800,"They're demolishing it Saturday. It's too bad.","Cinema Paradiso"
"974",7690500,7691960,"What's this ""Mr. Di Vita""?","Cinema Paradiso"
"975",7693586,7695060,"You used to order me around.","Cinema Paradiso"
"976",7695630,7700060,"Now that you're a big shot, it's a little different.","Cinema Paradiso"
"977",7700510,7703688,"But if you insist, Toto.","Cinema Paradiso"
"978",7707350,7708159,"Excuse me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"979",7714189,7716800,"Who would've believed it? Little Toto.","Cinema Paradiso"
"980",7749800,7753380,"Uncle, next time Grandma goes to Rome, I want to go too.","Cinema Paradiso"
"981",7753479,7755600,"I want to see what you do when you work.","Cinema Paradiso"
"982",7756314,7759193,"Fine, but I have to tell you, there's not much to see.","Cinema Paradiso"
"983",7759402,7762279,"I sell a lot of smoke and very little substance.","Cinema Paradiso"
"984",7764114,7765783,"Watch out, Salvatore. Don't let them take advantage of you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"985",7765992,7770829,"These two will eat you alive.","Cinema Paradiso"
"986",7773957,7775667,"Uncle, are you leaving tomorrow?","Cinema Paradiso"
"987",7778003,7781047,"I don't know. I don't know, Filippo.","Cinema Paradiso"
"988",7782100,7783180,"I really don't know.","Cinema Paradiso"
"989",7803659,7804898,"It must be for you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"990",7805359,7810028,"They've been calling all afternoon. They want to know whether you're leaving tonight...","Cinema Paradiso"
"991",7810528,7811228,"or tomorrow.","Cinema Paradiso"
"992",7821640,7822420,"Go on in.","Cinema Paradiso"
"993",8010610,8012555,"A double whiskey, please.","Cinema Paradiso"
"994",8015430,8016800,"Do you think that's him?","Cinema Paradiso"
"995",8023123,8025659,"Excuse me, are you Dr. Lenera?","Cinema Paradiso"
"996",8026800,8028279,"I'm a big fan.","Cinema Paradiso"

"1000",8193335,8195120,"I always have to call you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1001",8195760,8200968,"Why right now? You were supposed to pick me up at noon. Forget it.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1002",8201761,8202969,"I'm not coming.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1003",8203345,8207600,"You know what? I'll go by myself.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1004",8255189,8256799,"What are you thinking, Toto?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1005",8260986,8264860,"I was thinking that you and I have never spoken, Mama.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1006",8268494,8271379,"When I was little, I saw you...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1007",8273623,8275159,"as an old woman already.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1008",8277003,8278965,"Maybe it's the same for all children. Who knows?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1009",8289264,8291260,"Only now do I realize...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1010",8293352,8297100,"that you were young and beautiful.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1011",8299191,8300986,"You had your whole life ahead of you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1012",8303404,8307500,"How have you managed to live alone all this time...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1013",8308993,8313979,"with no one to think of you? You could have remarried.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1014",8315940,8316770,"Why not?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1015",8319961,8322899,"It's possible that back then I wouldn't have understood.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1016",8323799,8326260,"But eventually I would have.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1017",8328180,8331559,"I never had anyone, if that's what you're thinking.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1018",8332200,8334352,"It was my choice not to.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1019",8334559,8339979,"I remained faithful first to your father... and later to you and Lia.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1020",8341066,8344278,"That's the way I am. I can't help it.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1021",8345029,8346863,"And you're a lot like me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1022",8347073,8350479,"You're far too attached to your things.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1023",8351299,8354831,"I don't know if it's a good thing.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1024",8355039,8356108,"Loyalty is hard.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1025",8356886,8360545,"If you're loyal, you're forever alone.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1026",8360753,8362555,"But my life was whole.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1027",8369762,8371556,"I shouldn't have called you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1028",8373599,8375308,"It's not your fault, Mama.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1029",8376309,8379729,"It's just that I've always been afraid to come back.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1030",8382233,8387530,"And now, after all these years, I thought I was stronger...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1031",8388072,8390224,"that I'd forgotten a lot of things.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1032",8392243,8396997,"But in fact... I find I'm right back where I was...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1033",8398165,8400159,"as if I'd never been away.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1034",8402295,8405680,"And yet I look at Lia and feel that I don't even know her.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1035",8409385,8414347,"And you, Mama... I deserted you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1036",8415725,8417934,"Ran out on you like a bandit...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1037",8418144,8419811,"without any explanation.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1038",8420021,8424108,"I never asked for any. You don't have to explain anything to me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1039",8424316,8427904,"I always thought you did what was right.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1040",8428111,8432742,"Why dwell on it? Only one thing caused me pain.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1041",8432950,8437288,"When I used to bolt the door at night...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1042",8437663,8439555,"before going to bed...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1043",8440760,8442260,"You never used to do that.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1044",8442479,8443459,"No, no.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1045",8444795,8447965,"When you worked nights at the theater...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1046",8448174,8454100,"I couldn't fall asleep until you came home.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1047",8454979,8457683,"When you finally came in...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1048",8458100,8460500,"I'd pretend to be asleep.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1049",8460559,8463459,"But I'd hear you moving around the house.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1050",8463522,8469087,"Then, when you'd fall asleep, I'd get up...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1051",8469192,8470737,"and bolt the door.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1052",8472739,8476869,"After you left...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1053",8477286,8479664,"every time I did it...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1054",8479871,8483334,"it felt as if I were leaving someone outside the door.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1055",8484399,8486319,"Far away.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1056",8487922,8490049,"You were right to leave.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1057",8490257,8493093,"You did what you wanted to do.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1058",8495304,8496888,"Every time I call you,","Cinema Paradiso"
"1059",8497097,8499350,"a different woman answers.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1060",8499933,8502435,"I pretend to recognize them...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1061",8502645,8506773,"to save them the embarrassment of an introduction.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1062",8507274,8510903,"I'm sure they must think I'm a crazy old woman.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1063",8513698,8514615,"But...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1064",8514623,8519787,"I never heard in any of their voices that they really loved you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1065",8519995,8524333,"All the same, I'd have liked to see you...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1066",8524541,8530319,"settled down in love with someone.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1067",8532007,8534050,"But your life is there.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1068",8534260,8539079,"Here there are only ghosts. Let go, Toto.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1069",8603162,8604159,"Boccia!","Cinema Paradiso"
"1070",8611837,8616899,"Name... Vincenzo.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1071",8623683,8630260,"Hello? Hello? Hello?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1072",8673059,8674659,"Hello. Who is it?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1073",8679112,8681656,"I'd like to speak to Elena, please.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1074",8681865,8685120,"Speaking. Who is it?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1075",8688379,8689280,"Salvatore.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1076",8692680,8694280,"Salvatore... who?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1077",8700300,8707549,"Di Vita. This is Salvatore Di Vita. Do you remember?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1078",8709268,8714397,"I'm across the street from your house. Right here, Elena.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1079",8726786,8728059,"Of course I remember.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1080",8732625,8734254,"I'd like to see you, Elena.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1081",8735100,8736559,"Let's meet.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1082",8738463,8740108,"It was so long ago.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1083",8741149,8745860,"Why should we meet? What good would it do?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1084",8747181,8753180,"- Please, don't say no.- I'm old, Salvatore, and so are you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1085",8753888,8758450,"It's better not to see each other. Good-bye.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1086",8788638,8789599,"Hello.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1087",8855414,8856333,"Salvatore.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1088",8887947,8889659,"How did you know I'd be here?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1089",8891450,8894995,"I don't know how long it's been, but there are things I remember.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1090",8896621,8898979,"There weren't many places to choose from.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1091",8902250,8903350,"I looked for you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1092",8922898,8924283,"You're still beautiful.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1093",8928486,8932680,"What are you talking about? I'm old.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1094",8937329,8939000,"Please don't look at me that way.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1095",8943420,8944659,"Why did you come back?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1096",8946860,8950879,"Alfredo died. Do you remember him?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1097",8952762,8954360,"Of course I remember him.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1098",8955399,8956559,"I'm sorry.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1099",8959959,8962000,"You loved him very much.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1100",8964731,8969000,"I saw your daughter. She's very beautiful.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1101",8972073,8974420,"I bet there are many Salvatores running after her.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1102",8976536,8981879,"A few. But there aren't many like you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1103",8986379,8993319,"I also have a son. He's older. And you?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1104",8993559,9002299,"No children. I'm not married. Are you happy?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1105",9003200,9010327,"All things considered, yes. Although it wasn't what I dreamt of at the time.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1106",9013406,9015079,"You know my husband, don't you?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1107",9018702,9020879,"Sure I do. Boccia. I remember him well.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1108",9023373,9026860,"What does he do in life?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1109",9028421,9032680,"He's in politics. He's a regional delegate.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1110",9035520,9038014,"We met up again at the University of Pisa.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1111",9041266,9044659,"Why didn't you marry the man your father had chosen?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1112",9044811,9048180,"I didn't want to. And in the end, I won.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1113",9054237,9055824,"Back then I was waiting for you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1114",9062829,9067000,"But I never forgot you. Ever.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1115",9067288,9073000,"Neither did I. Even though you disappeared.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1116",9077969,9080000,"But why talk about it now?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1117",9086270,9088799,"We'll just end up looking pathetic and ridiculous.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1118",9090233,9091659,"Do you still live in Rome?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1119",9092025,9093407,"What are you talking about?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1120",9094694,9098487,"The last time we spoke, we made a date to meet at the Paradiso.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1121",9098489,9102067,"You never showed up! You disappeared without a trace!","Cinema Paradiso"
"1122",9103075,9106000,"How many years have gone by? More than 30!","Cinema Paradiso"
"1123",9113004,9115325,"I did show up for that date.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1124",9123975,9125806,"But I was late.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1125",9128020,9130288,"I had had a long fight with my parents.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1126",9133234,9136808,"I had tried to convince them that they couldn't separate us.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1127",9138906,9140459,"But it was no use.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1128",9143479,9144799,"They had decided...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1129",9146664,9149500,"to leave Sicily once and for all.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1130",9151878,9158924,"And we did. I didn't know what else to do, what else to say.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1131",9161304,9166520,"So I said yes. I would do as they wished.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1132",9168895,9174000,"In exchange, my father agreed to let me see you one last time to say good-bye.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1133",9176193,9182180,"I was hoping... that we would use that time to come up with a plan.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1134",9182200,9190680,"I thought we would... run away together.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1135",9198299,9200443,"My father drove me to the theater.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1136",9200555,9203720,"But Alfredo was in the booth, not you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1137",9206849,9210000,"I couldn't wait for you to get back.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1138",9212897,9214565,"Hurry up, Elena.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1139",9214773,9217527,"So I explained the situation to Alfredo.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1140",9217860,9220195,"I told him I was leaving that very night.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1141",9220570,9222399,"I begged him to tell you everything.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1142",9224700,9227360,"He was very nice to me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1143",9228703,9234000,"He listened... very carefully.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1144",9234960,9238255,"Calm down. Don't cry.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1145",9240000,9246979,"Now you listen to me. If you want me to tell Toto all that you told me... I will.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1146",9247879,9251979,"But if you want my advice... forget about him.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1147",9252479,9255020,"It would be better for both of you not to see each other.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1148",9256648,9259777,"My child....","Cinema Paradiso"
"1149",9260286,9262988,"fire always turns to ashes.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1150",9263197,9266760,"Even the greatest love comes to an end...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1151",9267100,9271496,"and many other loves come to take its place.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1152",9271706,9274507,"But Toto has only one future.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1153",9274979,9279221,"He can't see it now. I tell him, but he doesn't believe me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1154",9279629,9281665,"He might even kill me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1155",9283665,9287305,"But you can understand it.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1156",9287513,9292393,"You must understand it. Do it for him.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1157",9310620,9313622,"It's a secret I would rather not even have told you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1158",9322088,9323688,"Damn Alfredo!","Cinema Paradiso"
"1159",9326761,9328155,"He fooled even you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1160",9331139,9333893,"I told him I would take his advice.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1161",9334101,9336316,"But before I left, I wrote you that note.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1162",9348240,9350283,"I was going down the stairs...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1163",9352286,9355628,"and I figured that Alfredo couldn't see me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1164",9357500,9359443,"So I went back.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1165",9361879,9365879,"He sat there motionless at the projector.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1166",9367510,9370513,"I took one of those slips of paper off the wall...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1167",9372472,9375183,"and wrote down the address where you could find me...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1168",9377602,9379299,"and that I would wait for you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1169",9384110,9386004,"But you disappeared anyway.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1170",9397059,9398799,"How I looked for you, Elena!","Cinema Paradiso"
"1171",9402460,9404462,"You have no idea.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1172",9406048,9408759,"I wrote, I called. Nothing.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1173",9410802,9413096,"No one ever answered.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1174",9416976,9418959,"That's why I ran away.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1175",9423148,9424834,"And why I never came back here.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1176",9428154,9429667,"But I dreamt of you for years.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1177",9442627,9444559,"Even though years passed...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1178",9445388,9448120,"in every woman I met...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1179",9448549,9450860,"I sought only you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1180",9452552,9457140,"I've been very lucky in my career, it's true.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1181",9461020,9463159,"But something was always missing.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1182",9466816,9472614,"I never would have dreamt that everything would end...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1183",9473199,9475659,"because of the man who was a father to me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1184",9477870,9479579,"That madman.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1185",9480164,9483751,"He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I think I hated him too.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1186",9484543,9485888,"But in time...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1187",9487797,9489688,"I understood his words...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1188",9492009,9493579,"and also your silence.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1189",9496180,9498200,"I never found that note.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1190",9500726,9503646,"I covered it up with my own two hands.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1191",9504939,9508559,"I didn't see it. It's the only absurd explanation.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1192",9508609,9511529,"What does it matter now whether we find the reason?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1193",9513113,9514324,"What's done is done.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1194",9516325,9518200,"But Alfredo didn't betray you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1195",9518911,9521319,"He was the only one who truly understood you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1196",9522790,9526987,"Salvatore, if you had chosen to stay with me,","Cinema Paradiso"
"1197",9527043,9530173,"you wouldn't have made your movies and that would have been a shame.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1198",9530673,9534718,"They're wonderful. I've seen them all.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1199",9537555,9540099,"But you never should have changed your name.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1200",9541851,9543094,"You should have kept your name.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1201",9544770,9546397,"Salvatore Di Vita.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1202",9619000,9621500,"These are the things he left for you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1203",9636600,9641950,"When they showed your films on television...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1204",9642200,9643180,"he was happy.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1205",9645370,9647290,"He'd sit in front of it and forget all his troubles.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1206",9647665,9650501,"He knew all the words by heart...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1207",9652795,9656256,"and I would tell him what I saw.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1208",9656465,9662971,"And when the papers talked about you...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1209",9663181,9666167,"I'd have to read them to him two or three times.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1210",9670688,9674979,"- He never asked to see me?- No, never.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1211",9676861,9679155,"Once your mother said to him...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1212",9679863,9683360,"that you'd surely come if you wanted him to.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1213",9684659,9686245,"He was furious and said...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1214",9686453,9692260,"""No, Toto must never come back to Giancaldo!""","Cinema Paradiso"
"1215",9695129,9699634,"He didn't say it to be mean. He was a good man.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1216",9700885,9703799,"Who knows what was going through his head?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1217",9705138,9709268,"Towards the end, he started saying strange things.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1218",9711811,9714868,"A moment before he closed his eyes...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1219",9715700,9719799,"he told your mother she mustn't let you know.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1220",9734209,9739256,"1977, '78...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1221",9762822,9764364,"Moby Dick.","Cinema Paradiso"

"1228",9800692,9801879,"""forgive me.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1229",9804280,9806865,"""When I see you, I'll explain what happened.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1230",9807657,9810260,"""It was terrible not to find you here.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1231",9811037,9815500,"""I'm afraid I'll be leaving tonight for Tuscany with my mother.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1232",9815833,9818084,"""We're moving there.","Cinema Paradiso"

"1239",9852000,9853000,"When are you leaving?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1240",9855128,9856254,"This afternoon.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1241",9858298,9859200,"Elena,","Cinema Paradiso"
"1242",9860592,9862360,"perhaps in the future we could...","Cinema Paradiso"
"1243",9862379,9865180,"No, Salvatore, there is no future.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1244",9865587,9867000,"There is only the past.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1245",9868975,9871600,"Even last night's encounter was just a dream.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1246",9872270,9874000,"A wonderful dream.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1247",9876483,9878860,"When we were young, we never did it.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1248",9880486,9881500,"Do you remember?","Cinema Paradiso"
"1249",9884490,9887680,"Now that it has happened, I can't imagine a better ending.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1250",9894917,9896688,"I'll never agree with you.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1251",9898754,9899799,"Never.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1252",10003567,10007863,"It's my square. The square is mine.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1253",10031763,10034599,"Check the leader. Roll when you're ready.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1254",10034808,10037727,"I liked your film. It was terrific.","Cinema Paradiso"
"1255",10037935,10038600,"Thanks.","Cinema Paradiso"

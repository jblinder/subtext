"409",1785517,1790352,"- Maybe it was a mass murder.- I know it doesn't mean much by itself...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"410",1790421,1792912,"but every little bit counts.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"411",1792991,1796722,"When I get all my evidence together,I'm gonna have you tied up...","I Wake Up Screaming"

"413",1801299,1803790,"Perhaps they'rekeeping it from you...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"414",1803868,1806769,"but they told me at headquartersthat they think Harry Williams did it.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"415",1806838,1810399,"- I think they're wrong.- Oh, I see.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"416",1810475,1813808,"They believe Williams did it,but you're the holdout.","I Wake Up Screaming"

"488",2268200,2271465,"Take him up to my office.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"489",2277743,2281338,"There was something so young,so fresh, so full of life...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"490",2281413,2283847,"about Vicky that the very sight of hergave me new hope.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"491",2283916,2286885,"She made me feel thatperhaps I might succeed again...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"492",2286952,2290046,"in both my lifeand my profession.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"493",2290122,2294923,"But when I told her that, she just laughedat me. She told me I was a has-been.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"494",2294993,2297587,"She said she was going placesand didn't want to hitch her wagon...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"495",2297663,2300757,"to a- a falling star.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"496",2300833,2303427,"I even arranged for a screen testfor both of us.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"497",2303502,2305800,"A director I knew saidhe would give us a chance.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"498",2305871,2308999,"But when the day came,she went down there alone.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"499",2309074,2311440,"They decidedthey didn't need me.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"500",2311510,2314843,"Well, I couldn't stand that.I went down there and started a row.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"501",2314913,2319646,"A few days later, when she sentfor Christopher and Evans and me...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"502",2319718,2321709,"I pretended to themthat I knew nothing about it.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"503",2323322,2326155,"I pretended to myselfthat I didn't care.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"504",2326225,2328455,"But l- I didn't kill her!","I Wake Up Screaming"
"505",2328527,2332122,"- Where were you on the day of the murder?- I was in the sanitarium...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"506",2332197,2334188,"on East 77 th Street.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"507",2334266,2338225,"I go there occasionally when thingsget tough, and they take care of me.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"508",2338303,2341739,"- You can verify that if you like by calling the doctor.- Check up on that.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"509",2341807,2345538,"I've already checked.He was there, all right.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"510",2345611,2348876,"So there goes another oneof your suspects.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"511",2350382,2354011,"- Is that all for today, gentlemen?- For today.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"512",2369801,2372929,"Hello, Frankie. I see they're stilllettin' you out of here.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"513",2373005,2376441,"- I come and go as I please.They made me a trustee.
- Cornell must be slipping.","I Wake Up Screaming"

"515",2379545,2381536,"Uh-oh.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"516",2381613,2385447,"- Well, if it isn't Operator 13.- The nails for your coffin.","I Wake Up Screaming"

"521",2413512,2417710,"You see, I've spent so much of my own doughtrying to build up this case against you.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"522",2417783,2420946,"Well, if there's anythingyou need, just let me know.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"523",2421019,2425046,"I imagine they'll make it right with mewhen I bring in the material for your trial.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"524",2425123,2430083,"They usually do in these cases. I nick a guyon my own time and send him up to the chair.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"525",2430162,2433325,"- Then I get back pay.- Must be a great life.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"526",2433398,2436390,"Like a garbageman,only with people.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"527",2436468,2439835,"I got practicallyall the evidence I need now.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"528",2439905,2443272,"I could arrest you today, for that matter,but you might get some smart mouthpiece...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"529",2443342,2445367,"and get off with lifeinstead of the chair.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"530",2445444,2449676,"I won't be satisfieduntil I'm sure it's the chair.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"531",2449748,2454014,"You're a gay dog, Cornell.You make me feel as if I'm driving a hearse.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"532",2454086,2457487,"I know your type. I've seen hundreds of'em.I don't scare you enough...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"533",2457556,2461652,"to make you commit suicide,but I worry you just the same.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"534",2461727,2464321,"And when the day comes,they all act different.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"535",2464396,2467524,"Some scream. A few faint.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"536",2467599,2470625,"Some light a cigaretteand try a wisecrack...","I Wake Up Screaming"
"537",2470702,2476231,"but it sticks in their throats,especially when they're hung.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"538",2480012,2483743,"All right, Dracula. Get your rotten corpseout of that seat.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"539",2483815,2487080,"- Thanks.- Not at all.","I Wake Up Screaming"

"547",2571669,2574661,"Maybe you can help me.It's simply a matter of justice.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"548",2582880,2585440,"Nice little place you got here.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"549",2590855,2593983,"The garden of hope.Do you believe in hope, Miss Lynn?","I Wake Up Screaming"
"550",2594058,2597789,"Naturally. What's the goodof living without hope?","I Wake Up Screaming"
"551",2599063,2601463,"It can be done.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"552",2601532,2605696,"Miss Lynn, I got a hunch you know morethan you're telling me.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"553",2605770,2609365,"- Especially about Frankie Christopher.- That's not true.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"554",2609440,2612238,"I've told you everything I know.What more could there be?","I Wake Up Screaming"
"555",2612309,2615142,"If I knew,I wouldn't be asking, would I?","I Wake Up Screaming"
"556",2615212,2619945,"Now, listen. I know what you're going through.But justice is justice.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"557",2620017,2623350,"That guy is a sham,and he played your sister for a sucker.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"558",2623421,2625981,"When she tried to run out on him,he let her have it.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"559",2626057,2628116,"I don't believe that.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"560",2628192,2630217,"- You're in love with him, aren't you?- No, I'm not!","I Wake Up Screaming"
"561",2630294,2632421,"Yes, you are.","I Wake Up Screaming"
"562",2632496,2634430,"Your sister knew it,and I know it.","I Wake Up Screaming"

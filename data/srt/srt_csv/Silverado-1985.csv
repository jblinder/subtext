"179",1432897,1435297,"You know me.I don't want no trouble.","Silverado"
"180",1435366,1438358,"So I walked out into the street.","Silverado"
"181",1438436,1442236,"- He tries to shoot me in the back.- You had to kill him?","Silverado"
"182",1442306,1445207,"No, I winged himand he dropped his gun.","Silverado"
"183",1445276,1447506,"You're in here for winging a guy?","Silverado"
"184",1449013,1453575,"No, not exactly, because thenhis friend opened up on me.","Silverado"

"189",1473537,1476199,"Honest to God,he would've killed me.","Silverado"
"190",1478943,1481434,"The jury saw it differently.","Silverado"
"191",1482646,1486412,"- He's the guy you're gonna hang?- Tomorrow morning at 10:00.","Silverado"
"192",1486484,1488748,"I was afraid of that.","Silverado"

"194",1493457,1497052,"You know the law, Jake.You know what they did to me.","Silverado"
"195",1500998,1503796,"Blind Pete always said you'd hang.","Silverado"
"196",1506737,1510264,"I guess tomorrow at dawn,he'll be proved right.","Silverado"

"402",3201096,3203155,"just like Georgia!","Silverado"
"403",3203232,3205166,"You own this land.","Silverado"
"404",3205234,3209295,"I paid the government for it.That don't mean much out here.","Silverado"
"405",3209371,3214900,"Malachi, I'm living like a wildcatin a cave in them hills.","Silverado"
"406",3215978,3218139,"Hidin' out.","Silverado"
"407",3218214,3222241,"- Afraid to walk my own land.- What about the law?","Silverado"
"408",3222318,3226982,"Whose law? The law here runs a man downjust like these cattle.","Silverado"
"409",3228958,3231017,"That ain't right.","Silverado"
"410",3232061,3234757,"I had enough of what ain't right.","Silverado"
"411",3235898,3238958,"What we got here is a bad situation.","Silverado"
"412",3239034,3241764,"Those homesteaders you brought inare gonna make it worse.","Silverado"
"413",3241837,3245534,"When they come to stake their claims,it's gonna be the start of big trouble.","Silverado"
"414",3245608,3247633,"Gonna cut McKendrick offin the north.","Silverado"

"419",3267963,3271490,"The problem is, Emmett,you killed the wrong McKendrick.","Silverado"
"420",3272635,3276731,"Watch what you're saying around Augie.Emmett didn't kill anybody.","Silverado"
"421",3277640,3280700,"Well, it was self-defensesure enough.","Silverado"
"422",3280776,3283973,"But I do think you'd have to sayI killed old Murdo.","Silverado"
"423",3284046,3286378,"I think that's definitely the word.","Silverado"
"424",3286448,3291715,"The son is worse than the old man. He'ssmoother so you don't hear him coming.","Silverado"

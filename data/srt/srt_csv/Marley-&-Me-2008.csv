"1416",5252481,5255939,"Yeah. The footballtook it out of him.","Marley & Me"
"1417",5257386,5259252,"Let's go.","Marley & Me"
"1418",5259488,5261820,"I don't know. I just don't understand.","Marley & Me"
"1419",5261891,5265157,"A year ago, you couldn't waitto be done with your column.","Marley & Me"
"1420",5265228,5270324,"I know. But now I got this guy going throughevery sentence with a fine-tooth comb.","Marley & Me"
"1421",5270399,5273368,"I gotta admit, sometimes I missthe freedom where I could just-","Marley & Me"
"1422",5273436,5277805,"- What?- It's just- It's exhausting sometimes, John.","Marley & Me"
"1423",5277873,5281640,"You always wanting somethingthat you don't have.","Marley & Me"
"1424",5281712,5284373,"Are you happy?","Marley & Me"
"1425",5284448,5286881,"I mean, none of thiswas part of the plan.","Marley & Me"
"1426",5286949,5290680,"No. No, it wasn't part of the plan.","Marley & Me"
"1427",5290753,5293621,"But it's so much better.","Marley & Me"
"1428",5293689,5297319,"I'm just sort of done making plans.","Marley & Me"
"1429",5297394,5300726,"Marley! Oh, gross.","Marley & Me"

"1436",5325921,5327980,"Where'd he go? Marley?","Marley & Me"
"1437",5329859,5331828,"- What's going on?- I don't know.","Marley & Me"
"1438",5331895,5335626,"- He's not coming back.- Marley?","Marley & Me"
"1439",5335698,5338792,"Well, he couldn't have gone far. Marley?","Marley & Me"
"1440",5339802,5342067,"I'll come with you. Hold on.","Marley & Me"
"1441",5343407,5346376,"- Marley? I don't know where he could have gone.- Marley?","Marley & Me"
"1442",5346443,5350345,"Well, maybe he wentnext door again in the barn.","Marley & Me"
"1443",5350413,5354510,"- I'll check in the woodshed.- Okay.","Marley & Me"
"1444",5354583,5356574,"Marley?","Marley & Me"
"1445",5361992,5364789,"Marley?","Marley & Me"
"1446",5364860,5368957,"Marley? Oh, Marley.","Marley & Me"
"1447",5370533,5373127,"- Did you see anything?- No, nothing.","Marley & Me"

"1449",5383913,5386144,"Wow, it's pouring out there.","Marley & Me"
"1450",5386216,5388707,"- Did you find him?- You know what?","Marley & Me"
"1451",5388784,5393813,"He's out exploring.You know how he loves the woods.","Marley & Me"
"1452",5396893,5401626,"Bobby says dogs, when they'regonna die, they go away to do it.","Marley & Me"
"1453",5401698,5403722,"That's what his beagle did.","Marley & Me"
"1454",5403800,5407600,"Mmm. Well, you know,that's true for beagles.","Marley & Me"
"1455",5407671,5410765,"But, uh, not Labs like Marley.","Marley & Me"
"1456",5410841,5414332,"He's just out causing trouble.Don't worry.","Marley & Me"
"1457",5414411,5417073,"Okay, now, you finishedwith your homework?","Marley & Me"
"1458",5417146,5418738,"- Yep.- Nope.","Marley & Me"
"1459",5418814,5421511,"Nope? Well, let's make that a ""yep.""","Marley & Me"
"1460",5421585,5424314,"Come on now.","Marley & Me"
"1461",5428524,5432119,"Marley! Marley!","Marley & Me"
"1462",5433930,5437592,"Marley!","Marley & Me"
"1463",5442671,5444502,"Marley.","Marley & Me"
"1464",5446076,5450171,"Marley. Ah, Marley. You okay?","Marley & Me"
"1465",5453682,5456948,"Stay there.","Marley & Me"
"1466",5457020,5461889,"Why did his stomach twist? We don'texactly know why this happens.","Marley & Me"
"1467",5461957,5466622,"Most likely he ate or drank somethingquickly and his stomach just flipped.","Marley & Me"
"1468",5466695,5469961,"I did manage to get a tubedown there to relieve some of the gas.","Marley & Me"
"1469",5470033,5473490,"- I think I untwisted it.- He seems okay.","Marley & Me"
"1470",5473569,5476561,"For now, he's good.","Marley & Me"
"1471",5476640,5480167,"The problem is that once this happens,it almost always happens again.","Marley & Me"
"1472",5480243,5483644,"And if it does, I don't know whatI'm gonna be able to do for him.","Marley & Me"
"1473",5483712,5487809,"He's an older dog. I honestly don't thinkhe would survive the surgery.","Marley & Me"
"1474",5487884,5490751,"Well, we have to make surethat doesn't happen again.","Marley & Me"
"1475",5490820,5493881,"Well, most likely,it is gonna happen again.","Marley & Me"
"1476",5493957,5498018,"Well, we also talked about that maybehe ate too fast or drank too quickly.","Marley & Me"
"1477",5498094,5501188,"- Right.- So maybe it doesn't have to happen again.","Marley & Me"
"1478",5501264,5503595,"We'll monitor that.","Marley & Me"
"1479",5503667,5507534,"I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourselfthat he may not make it through the night.","Marley & Me"
"1480",5510140,5513939,"Maybe 10%% of dogssurvive this kind of a thing.","Marley & Me"
"1481",5514010,5517411,"What-What is that number based on?","Marley & Me"
"1482",5517479,5520881,"- What is it based on?- Yeah, the reason why I ask...","Marley & Me"
"1483",5520951,5523976,"is I bet that number'sbased on regular dogs.","Marley & Me"
"1484",5524054,5527921,"- Regular dogs?- Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs.","Marley & Me"
"1485",5527990,5530891,"I know people probably say thatall the time, but to be honest...","Marley & Me"
"1486",5530961,5533225,"I'm not sure he really is a dog.","Marley & Me"
"1487",5533296,5536265,"He once ate an answering machine.Just polished it off.","Marley & Me"
"1488",5536332,5540735,"He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digestedit. Then went and had the phone for dessert.","Marley & Me"
"1489",5540804,5544934,"Another time, my son had colic andthis guy sat up all night, didn't move...","Marley & Me"
"1490",5545007,5548534,"just stayed right there for nine hoursjust keeping an eye on Conor.","Marley & Me"
"1491",5548612,5553072,"So I think maybe thatthe number applies to regular dogs.","Marley & Me"
"1492",5553149,5556515,"- But not to him.- Well, you got a fighter here.","Marley & Me"
"1493",5556586,5558577,"Let's hope for the best.","Marley & Me"
"1494",5558654,5561180,"I know he's gonna be okay.","Marley & Me"
"1495",5561257,5564421,"I'll see you in the morning.","Marley & Me"
"1496",5584247,5587011,"- Oh, hi.- Hey.","Marley & Me"
"1497",5587082,5589551,"They're gonna-They're gonnakeep him overnight.","Marley & Me"
"1498",5589618,5592349,"But he seemed better when I left.","Marley & Me"
"1499",5592421,5595686,"The vet really seemed on top of it.","Marley & Me"
"1500",5597961,5601896,"- Are you okay?- Yeah. What are you reading?","Marley & Me"
"1501",5601965,5604296,"I'm reading your old columns.","Marley & Me"
"1502",5607170,5609569,"Marley's in so many of them.","Marley & Me"
"1503",5609639,5611731,"You still look at those?","Marley & Me"
"1504",5611807,5613832,"Yeah, I do sometimes.","Marley & Me"
"1505",5615979,5618948,"Even on the crappiest days-","Marley & Me"
"1506",5619015,5624078,"the kids are driving me nuts,laundry's not done...","Marley & Me"
"1507",5624154,5626917,"and a hundred other things are wrong-","Marley & Me"
"1508",5626989,5629583,"I always know that I have this.","Marley & Me"
"1509",5631560,5634724,"It's five minutes of you.","Marley & Me"
"1510",5634797,5639929,"Sometimes they're sadand sometimes they're really funny...","Marley & Me"
"1511",5640002,5644234,"silly or whatever,but- but they're all you.","Marley & Me"
"1512",5646042,5648510,"And for those five minutes...","Marley & Me"
"1513",5648578,5651046,"you make me feel better.","Marley & Me"
"1514",5664761,5667787,"You should read them.They're pretty great.","Marley & Me"
"1515",5669631,5671895,"Might even make a nice book.","Marley & Me"
"1516",5671967,5675301,"- A book?- Something.","Marley & Me"
"1517",5690686,5692677,"Hello?","Marley & Me"

"1523",5722152,5724279,"Dogs know stuff like that.","Marley & Me"
"1524",5724354,5727220,"- All dogs?- All good dogs.","Marley & Me"
"1525",5727289,5730918,"- Look, there he is! There he is! Marley.- Yeah.","Marley & Me"

"1535",5766328,5771595,"- What are you doing here?- Ah, story. D.A.'s showing off

"1547",5807036,5809868,"And the reason why Marleylooks like he's biting her head...","Marley & Me"
"1548",5809939,5812567,"is because the antennas on it-he went ballistic.","Marley & Me"
"1549",5812641,5815838,"- Things don't change.- That's right.","Marley & Me"

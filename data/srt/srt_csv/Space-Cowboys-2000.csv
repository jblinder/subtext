"180",918729,920560,"-...are...-Yeah.","Space Cowboys"
"181",920765,924861,"It wasn't designed for thisduration of duty, that's what.","Space Cowboys"
"182",925069,927060,"It was designed for the Skylab.","Space Cowboys"
"183",927271,929796,"My advice is to capture itand bring it home.","Space Cowboys"
"184",930007,931599,"It's too big.","Space Cowboys"
"185",932343,934777,"For the space shuttle?What kind of bird is it?","Space Cowboys"
"186",935713,940082,"It's a Russiancommunications satellite.","Space Cowboys"

"188",944155,946419,"That's not our primary concernat this time.","Space Cowboys"

"198",987932,989092,"But your knowledge...","Space Cowboys"
"199",989300,993327,"...and your knowledge of historyseems to make that impossible.","Space Cowboys"
"200",994338,997273,"Gerson's been taking creditfor my work since '58...","Space Cowboys"

"206",1022934,1026426,"Can't fix it from down here andcan't get a team up there in time.","Space Cowboys"

"209",1038382,1043319,"I'll give you two career advice: Stayaway from Gerson, as far as possible.","Space Cowboys"
"210",1045856,1048256,"Apparently the buzz on you's correct.","Space Cowboys"
"211",1048759,1050784,"And what buzz is that?","Space Cowboys"
"212",1052363,1055992,"You're not a team player.That's why you washed out at NASA.","Space Cowboys"

"1305",6532874,6536105,"With no Roger and no Hawk, Frank...","Space Cowboys"
"1306",6536311,6538609,"...you'll have to pilot this birdby yourself.","Space Cowboys"
"1307",6538814,6541476,"And you'll have to do it dead-stick.","Space Cowboys"
"1308",6545020,6549218,"Don't look at me. I've flown nothingbigger than a Cessna in 30 years.","Space Cowboys"
"1309",6551860,6555057,"Looks like I'm getting the better partof the deal here.","Space Cowboys"
"1310",6556865,6560028,"Stop laughing.You used up all your oxygen, dummy.","Space Cowboys"
"1311",6583158,6584750,"Frank's hot-wired it for you...","Space Cowboys"
"1312",6584960,6589488,"...but the trick is, those missilesrun out of fuel in 20,000 miles.","Space Cowboys"
"1313",6589764,6591425,"You launch them too soon...","Space Cowboys"
"1314",6591633,6594568,"...the warheads could findtheir way back home to Earth.","Space Cowboys"
"1315",6594769,6599138,"Too late, they'd run out of fueland then you'd be stuck with them.","Space Cowboys"
"1316",6600675,6602006,"Is this gonna work?","Space Cowboys"
"1317",6604646,6605670,"I don't know.","Space Cowboys"
"1318",6606481,6607675,"All right, fellas...","Space Cowboys"
"1319",6608216,6610343,"...let's shoot this baby to the moon.","Space Cowboys"
"1320",6613088,6614783,"Count down to one, right?","Space Cowboys"
"1321",6615357,6616790,"On a count of one.","Space Cowboys"
"1322",6636044,6636874,"One.","Space Cowboys"
"1323",6695136,6697104,"Ikon has left our gravitational field.","Space Cowboys"
"1324",6697305,6701139,"Hawk was able to launch the warheadsinto outer space.","Space Cowboys"
"1325",6701343,6702867,"How's Daedalus?","Space Cowboys"
"1326",6703545,6705775,"We have a critical situation.","Space Cowboys"
"1327",6707582,6711416,"The collision left us with one goodorbital maneuvering engine...","Space Cowboys"
"1328",6711620,6713679,"...and it's leaking fuel.","Space Cowboys"
"1329",6714522,6717320,"If there's not enough fuelfor a de-orbit burn...","Space Cowboys"
"1330",6717993,6720553,"It'll burn up, or it'll skip off.","Space Cowboys"
"1331",6721396,6723387,"What about guidance and avionics?","Space Cowboys"
"1332",6723832,6726528,"Well, the computers are unresponsive.","Space Cowboys"
"1333",6726935,6730769,"The only thing operatingat 100 percent is their air flow.","Space Cowboys"
"1334",6731740,6736541,"They're gonna have to reenter theatmosphere and set her down in manual.","Space Cowboys"
"1335",6736745,6740511,"-That's impossible.-Well, it's never happened before.","Space Cowboys"
"1336",6742651,6747020,"The only pilots alive who'd even thinkabout it are Roger and Hawk.","Space Cowboys"
"1337",6748023,6750856,"-Roger's wounded and Hawk's---Okay.","Space Cowboys"
"1338",6751860,6754852,"Let's get them as close as we can,then abort the landing.","Space Cowboys"
"1339",6755463,6759399,"They'll have to bail out.What are the survival probabilities?","Space Cowboys"
"1340",6761970,6763904,"20 percent at best.","Space Cowboys"
"1341",6764105,6768405,"Zero if they try to set it down.The bird's dead.","Space Cowboys"
"1342",6769110,6772443,"I doubt it would even glide,with its structural damage.","Space Cowboys"
"1343",6774683,6777015,"20 percent is better than zero.","Space Cowboys"
"1344",6792100,6796799,"-You still have that thing?-Yes. She'll dance all the way home.","Space Cowboys"
"1345",6802277,6803107,"Daedalus.","Space Cowboys"
"1346",6803411,6805675,"Stand by for Eugene Davis.","Space Cowboys"
"1347",6808049,6810540,"The judgment here is to go for Florida.","Space Cowboys"
"1348",6811786,6814254,"We'll get you as close to Kennedyas we can.","Space Cowboys"
"1349",6814656,6818820,"Now, you're still inverted.And you're flying tail-first.","Space Cowboys"
"1350",6819427,6823420,"Ordinarily, the autopilot woulddo a de-orbit burn to right you.","Space Cowboys"
"1351",6824299,6827962,"-But we don't have a computer, right?-That's right.","Space Cowboys"
"1352",6828770,6831898,"You don't have much fuel leftin that engine, either.","Space Cowboys"
"1353",6833007,6834440,"Swell.","Space Cowboys"
"1354",6834709,6837007,"Stand by for de-orbit burn.","Space Cowboys"
"1355",6850258,6853921,"That wasn't enough. Flip us aroundand use the forward RCS prop.","Space Cowboys"
"1356",6854129,6855357,"Shit.","Space Cowboys"
"1357",6855930,6857227,"All right.","Space Cowboys"
"1358",6871679,6872941,"Shit.","Space Cowboys"
"1359",6873581,6876948,"Easy, Frank. She's not a fighter jet.","Space Cowboys"
"1360",6877719,6879653,"A flying brick.","Space Cowboys"
"1361",6880755,6882188,"I hope not.","Space Cowboys"
"1362",6901576,6903806,"I'm gonna put her in a steep dive.","Space Cowboys"

"1364",6912053,6914283,"I'll make a series of tight turns.","Space Cowboys"
"1365",6914489,6916684,"Spill off some of this speed.","Space Cowboys"
"1366",6917358,6922057,"Jerry, clip everybody in. At about10,000, we should be over Florida.","Space Cowboys"
"1367",6922263,6924390,"Pop the hatch and geteverybody out of here.","Space Cowboys"
"1368",6925066,6926431,"Ethan and Roger first.","Space Cowboys"

"1370",6929437,6933203,"I'll line her up for a ditch overthe ocean. You got that, everyone?","Space Cowboys"
"1371",6943184,6944845,"Come on, hold together.","Space Cowboys"
"1372",6945053,6947214,"You're going in too steep, Frank.","Space Cowboys"
"1373",6950592,6952389,"She'll fall apart around us.","Space Cowboys"
"1374",6952594,6954562,"Hold together just a little longer.","Space Cowboys"
"1375",6974749,6978082,"Altitude 30 miles over Texas.","Space Cowboys"

"1381",7024465,7027662,"He's on final, but way too hot.He'll overshoot at this rate.","Space Cowboys"

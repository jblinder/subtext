"552",2600096,2601896,"Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"553",2602894,2606440,"But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"554",2606501,2608746,"Human life.  Not a growth market.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"905",4420643,4424042,"To become better.  Better than us.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"906",4424043,4425944,"He keeps building bodies.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"907",4426014,4431228,"Person bodies.  The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"908",4431320,4433220,"But he keeps coming back to it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"909",4433453,4437323,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"910",4437327,4441327,"They don't need to be protected.  They need to evolve.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"988",4802024,4803493,"On the loop by the bridge.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"989",4804561,4807635,"It's them.  I got three with the cradle, one in the cab.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"990",4807726,4809532,"I could take out the driver.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"991",4809595,4812278,"Negative!  If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"992",4812368,4814167,"We need to draw out Ultron.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1037",5184913,5186819,"The cradle.  Did you get it?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1038",5186846,5188747,"Stark'll take care of it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1047",5219686,5220587,"Anything on Nat?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1048",5220677,5224275,"Haven't heard.  But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1049",5224283,5228649,"- This is sealed tight.- We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1050",5229921,5234076,"Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1051",5234327,5237935,"There's some nets I can cast.  Yeah, all right.  I'll find her.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1052",5240100,5245338,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1053",5245738,5246993,"Yeah, about that.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1054",5251375,5252274,"No.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1055",5252277,5254261,"- You have to trust me.- Kinda don't.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1056",5254347,5258148,"Our ally?  The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1057",5260051,5261351,"I found him.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1058",5261453,5262777,"Hello, Dr. Banner.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1059",5263046,5266893,"Ultron didn't go after Jarvis 'cause he was angry.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1060",5266894,5270493,"He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1061",5270500,5275278,"So Jarvis went underground.  Okay, scattered, dumped his memory.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1062",5275279,5276378,"But not his protocols.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1063",5276618,5279841,"He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1064",5281503,5287904,"So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1065",5287923,5291948,"No, of course not!  I want to help you put Jarvis in this thing.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1066",5293930,5297729,"We're out of my field here.  You know bio-organics better than anyone.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1067",5297755,5302585,"And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix can beat Ultron's?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1068",5302626,5305413,"Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1069",5305631,5310931,"This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1070",5310932,5312533,"he thinks are his winning personality.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1071",5312603,5315103,"- We have to.- I believe it's worth a go.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1072",5316877,5321564,"No.  I'm in a loop.  I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1073",5321577,5324777,"I know, I know.  I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1075",5337927,5342252,"It's not a loop.  It's the end of the line.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1076",5363158,5368257,"I was unsure you'd wake up.  I hoped you would, I wanted to show you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1080",5380471,5385189,"The world made clean for the new man to rebuild.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1081",5385369,5387403,"I was meant to be new.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1082",5388149,5391253,"I was meant to be beautiful.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1083",5391694,5397041,"The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1085",5401694,5405795,"You've wounded me.  I give you full marks for that.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1086",5405800,5409997,"But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1113",5636662,5643262,"It's the Mind Stone.  It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1125",5679502,5682131,"Yeah.  Her seal of approval means jack to me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1126",5682270,5685336,"Their powers.  The horrors in our heads.  Ultron himself.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1129",5689880,5692268,"Is it?  Are you?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1140",5731256,5737297,"I don't want to kill Ultron.  He's unique.  And he's in pain.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1159",5839353,5841606,"And that's what we signed up for.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1160",5841608,5843908,"But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1161",5844637,5848238,"So our priority is getting them out.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1162",5848439,5852033,"We're under attack.  Clear the city, now.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1163",5859413,5860907,"Get off your asses.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1164",5861987,5864868,"All they want is to live their lives in peace.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1165",5864890,5866890,"And that's not going to happen today.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1167",5870335,5871854,"And we can get the job done.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1168",5874865,5877382,"We find out what Ultron's been building.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1169",5877988,5879444,"We find Romanoff,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1170",5880372,5881864,"and we clear the field.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1171",5882725,5884698,"Keep the fight between us.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1172",5892251,5896724,"Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1173",5897355,5902155,"This isn't just about beating him.  It's about whether he's right.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1179",5919113,5921046,"I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1180",5921511,5923610,"Yeah.  I did.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1181",5929891,5931085,"So what's our play?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1182",5931225,5934225,"- I'm here to get you to safety.- Job's not finished.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1183",5934310,5938704,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1184",5938783,5940583,"And you've done plenty.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1185",5942734,5944158,"Our fight is over.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1186",5945905,5947435,"So we just disappear?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1187",5952747,5953747,"Come on.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1188",5958323,5962184,"Your man's in the church, boss.  I think he's waiting for you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1189",5966926,5968796,"Come to confess your sins?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1190",5969328,5970841,"I don't know, how much time you got?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1191",5970841,5971942,"More than you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1192",5973064,5976765,"Uhhh.  Have you been juicing?  A little Vibranium cocktail?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1193",5977333,5979726,"You're looking...I don't wanna say, puffy...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1194",5979801,5981489,"You're stalling to protect the people.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1195",5981820,5984746,"Well, that is the mission.  Did you forget?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1196",5984909,5988019,"I've moved beyond your mission.  I'm free.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1197",5992287,5993287,"What,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1198",5994015,5996668,"you think you're the only one stalling?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1199",5997487,6000500,"There's the rest of the Vibranium.  Function: still unclear.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1200",6000627,6002396,"This is how you end, Tony.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1205",6036327,6037327,"Ultron!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1206",6043734,6047270,"My Vision.  They really did take everything from me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1207",6047738,6051479,"- You set the terms, you can change them.- All right.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1208",6052976,6053877,"Ahhh!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1209",6074966,6076328,"FRIDAY!  The Vision?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1210",6076368,6080578,"Boss, it's working.  He's burning Ultron out of the 'net, he won't escape through there.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1211",6084609,6085898,"You shut me out!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1212",6086912,6088167,"You think I care?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1213",6090095,6093252,"You take away my world, I take away yours.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1218",6154014,6160711,"Do you see?  The beauty of it.  The inevitability.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1219",6160887,6164353,"You rise, only to fall.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1220",6166359,6172418,"You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1221",6172420,6176720,"and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1222",6177336,6181649,"Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1223",6181939,6183296,"It means nothing.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1224",6183716,6189882,"When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1225",6194452,6195452,"We gotta move.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1226",6196021,6197230,"You're not going to turn green?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1227",6197592,6200326,"I've got a compelling reason to not lose my cool.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1228",6200393,6201693,"I adore you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1229",6210002,6211703,"But I need the other guy.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1230",6216875,6218298,"Let's finish the job.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1231",6235423,6238668,"- I really hope this makes us even.- (grunt)","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1232",6238965,6241520,"- Now go be a hero.- Raaar!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1233",6249479,6253717,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1234",6253747,6258010,"- If it drops?- Right now the impact would kill thousands.  Once it gets high enough...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1235",6258011,6259435,"...global extinction.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1236",6263256,6265569,"That building's not clear, its tenth floor.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1237",6270581,6271581,"Hi.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1238",6272530,6274927,"Okay.  Get in the tub!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1239",6282073,6284863,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1240",6286052,6287685,"Cap, you got incoming.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1241",6287779,6289480,"Incoming already came in.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1242",6291949,6294947,"Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1243",6295221,6298426,"The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1244",6298527,6303944,"You get hurt, hurt 'em back.  You get killed, walk it off.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1245",6339029,6340029,"Go, go, move!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1246",6345302,6347103,"How could I let this happen?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1247",6347271,6348564,"Hey, hey, you okay?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1248",6349006,6350027,"This is all our fault.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1249",6350039,6350828,"Hey, look at me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1250",6350896,6353297,"It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1251",6353380,6354740,"Are you up for this?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1252",6354947,6355947,"Are you?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1253",6356728,6360332,"Look, I just need to know, 'cause the city i-, is flying.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1254",6360554,6364372,"Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1255",6364381,6366181,"and I have a bow and arrow.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1256",6366182,6367984,"None of this makes sense.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1257",6370362,6374034,"But I'm going back out there because of my job.  Okay?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1258",6374100,6376140,"And I can't do my job and babysit.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1259",6376432,6379112,"It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1260",6379113,6382212,"If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1261",6382337,6385511,"Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1262",6385518,6388018,"but if you step out that door,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1263",6388512,6389805,"you are an Avenger.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1264",6394220,6395649,"All right, good chat.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1265",6399056,6401057,"Yeah, the city is flying.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1266",6434693,6435693,"I got you!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1267",6436396,6437484,"Just look at me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1268",6444068,6445701,"You can't save them all.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1269",6447113,6448134,"You'll never...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1270",6448796,6451518,"""You'll never"" what?  You didn't finish!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1271",6455215,6456779,"What, were you napping?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1272",6478833,6480134,"Thor!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1273",6481506,6483136,"You are bothering me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1274",6492319,6493319,"Ow!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1275",6494887,6495887,"Uh...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1276",6519243,6523020,"- All right, we're all clear here.- We are not clear!  We are very not clear!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1277",6525815,6527516,"All right, coming to you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1278",6527587,6528743,"[Keep up, old man.]","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1279",6531792,6533015,"Nobody would know.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1280",6534007,6535007,"Nobody.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1281",6536958,6543746,"The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him, uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.  I miss him already.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1282",6558514,6560333,"Hold your fire!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1283",6569627,6570627,"Romanoff!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1284",6571162,6572162,"Thanks.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1285",6581506,6587003,"The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.  Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust.  The city's not coming down slow.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1286",6587005,6589414,"The spire's Vibranium.  If I get Thor to hit it...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1287",6589716,6592617,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1288",6592652,6595858,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1289",6596036,6598708,"That could vaporize the city.  And everyone on it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1290",6605979,6607697,"The next wave's gonna hit any minute.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1291",6607701,6609002,"What have you got, Stark?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1292",6609064,6612738,"Well, nothing great.  Maybe a way to blow up the city.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1293",6612939,6615362,"That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1294",6615507,6618233,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1295",6618310,6620371,"Impact radius is getting bigger every second.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1296",6620609,6623127,"We're going to have to make a choice.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1297",6623150,6626725,"Cap, these people are going nowhere.  If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1298",6626886,6628186,"Not 'til everyone's safe.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1299",6628487,6631287,"Everyone up here versus everyone down there?  There's no math there.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1300",6631590,6633590,"I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1301",6633694,6635567,"I didn't say we should leave.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1302",6637958,6639591,"There's worse ways to go.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1303",6644372,6647296,"Where else am I gonna get a view like this?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1304",6648890,6653591,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff.  It's about to get better.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1305",6676902,6682954,"Nice, right?  I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.  She's dusty, but she'll do.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1306",6682956,6684556,"Fury, you son of a bitch.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1307",6684557,6687019,"Oooh!  You kiss your mother with that mouth?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1308",6687314,6689291,"Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1309",6689380,6695779,"Lifeboats secure to deploy.  Disengage in 3, 2...take 'em out.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1310",6705229,6706248,"This is SHIELD?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1311",6707230,6709747,"This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1312",6711470,6712764,"This is not so bad.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1313",6715940,6716940,"Let's load 'em up.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1314",6722979,6725966,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1315",6726362,6727791,"Show 'em what we got.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1316",6728284,6729284,"You're up.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1317",6734726,6737648,"Yes!  Now this is gonna be a good story.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1318",6740234,6742306,"Yup.  If you live to tell it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1319",6742536,6744476,"You think I can't hold my own?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1320",6744550,6746671,"We get through this, I'll hold your own.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1321",6746806,6748507,"You had to make it weird.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1322",6752346,6754747,"Donovan!  I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1323",6756818,6758305,"All right, let's load 'em up!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1324",6772068,6774296,"All right, here we go.  Here we go, let's move.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1325",6774498,6775498,"Let's go everyone!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1326",6778028,6784762,"Number six boat is topped and locked.  Or, uh, or stocked, topped, s- it...it's uh, full of people.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1327",6786409,6787409,"Incoming!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1328",6790423,6791423,"Oh, God!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1329",6802493,6803990,"You think you're saving anyone?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1330",6804895,6811082,"I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead.  Even you can't stop that.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1331",6811403,6820202,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say!  Are you ready?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1332",6826920,6828725,"It's terribly well balanced.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1333",6828773,6832990,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1334",6833304,6836725,"I got it!  Create a heat seal.  I can...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1335",6837586,6841735,"- I can supercharge the spire from below.- Running numbers.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1336",6851010,6854430,"- A heat seal could work with enough power.- Thor, I got a plan!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1337",6854479,6857344,"We're out of time.  They're coming for the core.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1338",6857349,6859582,"- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.- On it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1340",6871430,6872930,"- You good?- Yeah.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1341",6873653,6874653,"Romanoff?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1342",6875135,6877876,"You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1343",6878137,6880837,"Relax, Shell-head.  Not all of us can fly.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1344",6886278,6888367,"- What's the drill?- This is the drill.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1345",6888448,6890547,"If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1346",6894819,6896418,"Is that the best you can do?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1347",6906466,6907485,"You had to ask.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1348",6908198,6910167,"This is the best I can do.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1349",6910935,6915386,"This is exactly what I wanted.  All of you against all of me.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1350",6916109,6918725,"How can you possibly hope to stop me?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1351",6918942,6919942,"Well.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1352",6920176,6923520,"Like the old man said.  Together.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1353",6923881,6925481,"Raaarrrr!!!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1354",7011037,7014637,"Uhh!  You know, with the benefit of hindsight....","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1355",7019234,7020234,"Rarrrr!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"1358",7027612,7030112,"I'm on it.  Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1359",7030488,7032457,"War Machine, comin' at you, right a-...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1360",7039126,7040326,"Okay, what?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1361",7040631,7044255,"We gotta move out.  Even I can tell the air is getting thin.  You guys get to the boats...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1362",7044323,7046323,"I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1363",7046435,7047697,"What about the core?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1364",7048006,7052293,"I'll protect it.  It's my job.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1365",7053177,7054978,"Nat.  Let's go.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1366",7059319,7063470,"- Get the people on the boats.- I'm not going to leave you here.
- I can handle these.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1367",7065320,7067546,"Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1368",7067557,7069278,"- Hmm.- You understand?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1369",7071126,7073346,"You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1370",7073422,7074622,"Ha ha. Go.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1371",7075865,7081456,"- Boss, power levels are way below opt-...- Re-route everything.  We get one shot at this.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1372",7084007,7087560,"I know what I need to do.  The dining room!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1373",7087645,7092511,"If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1374",7092597,7095559,"Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1375",7095605,7097690,"You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1376",7097787,7099761,"No one eats in a dining room.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1377",7102225,7103225,"[Raarrrr!]","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1378",7104462,7106368,"We don't have a lot of time.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1379",7106395,7108164,"So get your ass on a boat.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1380",7120881,7121980,"Hey big guy.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1381",7124083,7125649,"Sun's getting real low.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1382",7125859,7129608,"You're safe now.  It'll be okay, buckle up...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1383",7131523,7133216,"...secure your gear and find a seat...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1384",7133292,7134292,"Costel?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1385",7135525,7136926,"We were in the market.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1386",7137494,7139188,"Costel?!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1387",7152878,7155072,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1388",7155113,7156814,"- Is this the last of them?- Yeah.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1389",7156917,7158216,"Everyone else is on the carrier.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1390",7158247,7163313,"- Y'know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.- Maybe not.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1391",7182074,7188621,"(singing) I have no strings, so I have fun.  I'm not tied up to anyone.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1392",7190217,7191511,"C'mon, let me help you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1393",7224123,7226024,"You didn't see that coming.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1394",7282070,7283768,"Oh, for god's sake...!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1395",7300961,7302261,"Costel!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1396",7314137,7315561,"No, no.  I'm fine.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1397",7318345,7320373,"Oh it's been a long day.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1398",7335194,7336194,"Wanda.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1399",7337000,7339872,"If you stay here, you'll die.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1400",7341498,7342899,"I just did.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1401",7343770,7345698,"Do you know how it felt?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1402",7359747,7361371,"It felt like that.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1403",7396658,7398514,"Thor, on my mark.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1404",7413970,7415171,"Now!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1405",7442350,7443751,"Hey big guy.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1406",7444569,7445970,"We did it.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1407",7446034,7447595,"The job's finished.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1408",7448072,7451072,"Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1409",7455148,7459917,"We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1410",7460748,7461868,"I need you t...","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1411",7506496,7507895,"You're afraid.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1412",7508529,7511529,"- Of you?- Of death.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1413",7511970,7513530,"You're the last one.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1414",7514363,7516813,"You were supposed to be the last.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1415",7516837,7521139,"Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1416",7521978,7524494,"I suppose we're both disappointments.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1417",7524546,7527846,"Ha ha ha ha.  I suppose we are.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1418",7528688,7530287,"Humans are odd.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1419",7531686,7535891,"They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1420",7537125,7539297,"try to control what won't be.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1421",7540231,7542748,"But there is grace in their failings.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1422",7543118,7544752,"I think you missed that.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1423",7545734,7547055,"They're doomed.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1424",7547838,7549038,"Yes.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1425",7552542,7556046,"But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1426",7557798,7560311,"It's a privilege to be among them.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1427",7560349,7562381,"You're unbearably naive.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1428",7563220,7564557,"Well,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1429",7566021,7568051,"I was born yesterday.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1430",7623154,7625554,"(chatter)","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1431",7627438,7628970,"- Talk to Lorraine.- Okay.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1432",7630930,7631930,"What's that?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1433",7640935,7642564,"Say hi to Auntie Nat.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1434",7644132,7645332,"Fat.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1435",7646207,7650796,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea,","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1436",7652743,7658666,"could be the Quinjet.  But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1437",7658682,7659682,"Right.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1438",7660684,7663233,"Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1439",7664021,7665519,"He'll send a postcard.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1440",7666257,7667751,"""Wish you were here.""","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1441",7670029,7673386,"You sent me to recruit him, way back when.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1442",7674329,7677255,"Did you know then what was going to happen?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1443",7679672,7685903,"You never know.  You hope for the best and make do with what you get.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1444",7686109,7687601,"I got a great team.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1445",7688445,7689943,"Nothing lasts forever.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1446",7691047,7696757,"Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.  No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes 'round.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1447",7700422,7702569,"- The rules have changed.- We're dealing with something new.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1448",7702661,7705817,"- Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.- A machine.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1449",7705896,7708998,"- So it doesn't count.- No.  It's not, like, a person lifting the hammer.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1450",7709096,7711796,"- Right.  Different rules for us.- Nice guy.  But artificial.
- Thank you.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1451",7711871,7715408,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1452",7716038,7717807,"It's safe with the Vision.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1453",7718041,7720761,"In these days, safe is in short supply.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1454",7723082,7727246,"- But if you put the hammer in an elevator...- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1455",7727286,7728570,"I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1456",7728650,7730216,"Not if you don't leave.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1457",7730453,7731609,"I have no choice.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1458",7732353,7736435,"The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1459",7736439,7738239,"That's not a coincidence.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1460",7738731,7741832,"Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1461",7742329,7745787,"- Once all these pieces are in position...- Triple Yahtzee?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1462",7745837,7747527,"You think you can find out what's coming?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1463",7747573,7748573,"I do.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1464",7749408,7753354,"Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1465",7760778,7763970,"That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1466",7766358,7767895,"I'm gonna miss him though.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1467",7767993,7772484,"And you're gonna miss me.  There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1468",7772529,7774327,"I will miss you, Tony.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1469",7774632,7778021,"Yeah?  Well, it's time for me to tap out.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1470",7779136,7784804,"Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm.  Hope nobody blows it up.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1471",7784873,7785761,"The simple life.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1472",7785807,7787363,"You'll get there one day.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1473",7787646,7791747,"I don't know.  Family, stability.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1474",7792248,7795248,"The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1475",7797056,7799297,"I think someone else came out.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1476",7803060,7805761,"- You all right?- (soldiers echo) Go! March! (continues)","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1477",7805761,7807362,"I'm home.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1478",7815908,7817921,"You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1479",7817978,7820430,"I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1480",7820479,7823896,"I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1481",7824000,7825020,"How do we look?","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1482",7825082,7828171,"- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.- We've got some hitters.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1483",7828850,7833340,"- They're good.  They're not a team.- Let's beat 'em into shape.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1484",7851570,7853371,"Avengers...!","Avengers: Age of Ultron"
"1485",7980859,7983560,"Humans.","Avengers: Age of Ultron"

"6",180420,183280,"You know it struck me after I telephonedyou. Rather cheek on my part asking ...","Dead of Night"
"7",183520,187470,"a busy architect like yourself to come down andspend the weekend with a set of complete strangers.","Dead of Night"
"8",188080,190950,"You see we're pretty cramped for space here.We need at least two more bedrooms.","Dead of Night"
"9",191200,192590,"And there's only one living room?","Dead of Night"
"10",192840,195630,"Yes, only one living room. However we'll go into all that in the morning, shall we.","Dead of Night"
"11",201040,204790,"- Know this part of the world at all ?- No, I've never been here before...","Dead of Night"
"12",206130,208690,"- ... not actually.- Let me take your things.","Dead of Night"
"13",210410,213440,"- Ha, fancy you spotting that! Trained professional eye?- Yes, of course","Dead of Night"
"14",214930,217800,"We've got several other guests, so I've put youin the barn, but don't get worried ...","Dead of Night"
"15",218050,221720,"- It has central heating and every modern convenience.- The very words I was going to use.","Dead of Night"
"16",221970,225920,"- Listen, I expect they've started tea.- Yes ... yes, I know.","Dead of Night"
"17",229570,231720,"Mother, this is Mr Craig.","Dead of Night"
"18",231970,234600,"Oh, I'm so glad he's here.","Dead of Night"
"19",237720,241650,"How do you do.Come along in.","Dead of Night"
"20",243020,244530,"Let me introduce you to the others...","Dead of Night"
"21",244680,246700,"- Mrs Cortland...- How do you do.","Dead of Night"
"22",247200,251400,"- Dr Van Straaten...- How do you do. Very pleased to meet you.","Dead of Night"
"23",251900,255000,"- and ... Mr Grainger...- How do you do.","Dead of Night"
"24",255100,259100,"- and this is Sally O'Hara.- How do you do.","Dead of Night"
"25",259580,263280,"You must be tired after your drive.Come and sit over here by the fire.","Dead of Night"
"26",263860,267650,"I can't tell you how delighted I amyou were able to accept my son's invitation.","Dead of Night"
"27",268230,270940,"You see we are both such admirers ofyour work.","Dead of Night"
"28",271230,272780,"You'd like some tea, wouldn't you?","Dead of Night"
"29",273470,274900,"You take milk and sugar?","Dead of Night"
"30",276830,278180,"Milk and sugar, Mr Craig?","Dead of Night"
"31",284670,287340,"You're still there.So it isn't a dream this time.","Dead of Night"
"32",287590,288620,"I beg your pardon?","Dead of Night"
"33",288870,291380,"... and if it isn't a dream this time..I must be going out of my mind","Dead of Night"
"34",292630,294860,"Of course!Dr van Straaten...","Dead of Night"
"35",295870,298910,"You're the psychiatrist.You always treat me.","Dead of Night"
"36",299160,300710,"You'll treat me now won't you?","Dead of Night"
"37",301040,303750,"Forgive me. I don't quite understand the joke.","Dead of Night"
"38",304000,307110,"It isn't a joke. I only wish it were.I've seen you in my dream.","Dead of Night"
"39",307360,309190,"Sounds like a sentimental songdoesn't it.","Dead of Night"
"40",309440,311790,"I've dreamt about you over and overagain, doctor.","Dead of Night"
"41",312040,316150,"It hardly turns you into a mental caseafter all recurring dreams are quite common.","Dead of Night"
"42",316400,320310,"But how did I come to dream about you?I've never set eyes on you in my life.","Dead of Night"
"43",320560,325190,"Very likely, you have seen my photograph in thepapers. That's why my face seems familiar to you.","Dead of Night"
"44",325440,330120,"I don't think so. And even if it were, is that any reason I should keep on dreaming about you?","Dead of Night"
"45",330370,333160,"After all, you don't mean anythingto me.","Dead of Night"
"46",333730,338920,"There may be an association of ideas. I may belinked to something that means a great deal to you.","Dead of Night"
"47",339170,340000,"Such as?","Dead of Night"
"48",340730,343360,"I should have to psychoanalyse you to find that out.","Dead of Night"
"49",343610,348000,"But it doesn't end there. You see, everybodyin this room is part of my dream. Everyone.","Dead of Night"
"50",349300,350830,"Gosh!Good Lord, really?","Dead of Night"
"51",350880,352040,"You startle us!","Dead of Night"
"52",352100,353200,"What all of us?","Dead of Night"
"53",353450,356760,"I can only tell you that when I came into this room, I recognised you all.","Dead of Night"
"54",357010,360690,"He has seen all our photographs inthe newspapers, has he, Dr van Staaten?","Dead of Night"
"55",360940,363970,"Of course, you may have seen me on the sportspage. Motor racing's my line.","Dead of Night"
"56",364260,369090,"And there was one of me once. In the Ponds Mertre.When I'm the bridesmaid at my sister's wedding.","Dead of Night"
"57",369040,372250,"You remember. But, I shouldn't thinkyou've come across that.","Dead of Night"
"58",372580,377600,"- Well, I never had my photograph taken. - Oh yes you did dear once. You know the one. You were 6months old.","Dead of Night"
"59",377860,381450,"Good Lord, that's right. I don't think hewould recognise me, I was much fatter.","Dead of Night"
"60",382180,386570,"Surely, Mr Craig, you might have seen any of ussome time or another. In the street or anywhere.","Dead of Night"
"61",386820,390450,"Yes, but why should I always dream about meetingyou all together...","Dead of Night"
"62",390710,394300,"... here in this room that I have never been in in my life, until today?","Dead of Night"
"63",394590,397020,"Mr Craig, can you describe what happensin your dream?","Dead of Night"
"64",397270,401950,"Well, not in detail, but it always startsexactly the same as when I arrived, just now.","Dead of Night"
"65",402360,406870,"I turn off the main road into the lane. At thebend in the lane, the house comes into view.","Dead of Night"
"66",407120,408630,"I stop, because I recognise it.","Dead of Night"
"67",409240,412230,"Then I drive on again, and Foley meets me at the front door.","Dead of Night"
"68",412480,414030,"I recognise him, too.","Dead of Night"
"69",414800,418990,"And then, when I'm taking off my coat,I have the most extraordinary feeling.","Dead of Night"
"70",419240,424040,"I nearly turn and run from it, because I know I am goingto come face to face with the six of you.","Dead of Night"
"71",424290,428320,"Well, you've only come face to face with fiveof us so far, not counting Eliot.","Dead of Night"
"72",428570,429680,"That's right. Five of you.","Dead of Night"
"73",430130,433560,"- There is a sixth person who comes in later.- Can you describe this late arrival?","Dead of Night"
"74",433810,437350,"- It's an attractive girl, with dark hair.- Is that you can tell us about her?","Dead of Night"
"75",437610,441360,"She comes in quite unexpectedly, and sayssomething about not having any money.","Dead of Night"
"76",442130,443560,"A penniless brunette, eh ...","Dead of Night"
"77",444050,447000,"How romantic. Do you fall madly in lovewith her Mr Craig?","Dead of Night"
"78",447250,449360,"Have you ever told anyone about your dream?","Dead of Night"
"79",449610,452570,"No. I don't think so.Not even my wife.","Dead of Night"
"80",453500,458360,"Now I come to think of it, after I wake, it neverstays in my memory for more than a few seconds.","Dead of Night"
"81",458620,461050,"And none of it ever comes back to me untilthe next time it starts.","Dead of Night"
"82",461300,464330,"In fact there is no evidence you ever dreamedthis dream at all, is there?","Dead of Night"
"83",464580,467210,"None whatever.I haven't a scrap of proof.","Dead of Night"
"84",467460,470490,"Personally, I don't need any.I believe what you claim, Mr Craig.","Dead of Night"
"85",470740,476040,"- I believe you really have dreamt about us all.- So do I.  -And so do I.  -Me too  -I didn't argue too.","Dead of Night"
"86",477300,480920,"I don't question that you have been subject to a recurring dream.","Dead of Night"
"87",481180,483570,"And no doubt it hasa background similar to this.","Dead of Night"
"88",483910,487260,"It would be quite enough to account for your feelingthat you have been here before.","Dead of Night"
"89",487510,488940,"It's quite a common experience.","Dead of Night"
"90",489190,491900,"- And that's all there is to it?- That's all there is to it!","Dead of Night"
"91",492280,497980,"Well, I must say its very disappointing not to give othersa leading character in some sort of supernatural drama, after all!","Dead of Night"
"92",498770,503170,"- Cigarette anyone? - You never know, perhaps it's likewe're beings in the story of the Looking Glass","Dead of Night"
"93",503430,507380,"None of us exist at all. We're nothing butcharacters in Mr Craig's dream.","Dead of Night"
"94",507400,511250,"That's right, and when he wakes up we shallall vanish into thin air.","Dead of Night"
"95",511510,513390,"Dear me, what a morbid notion!","Dead of Night"
"96",514040,517820,"Let's get this straight doctor, you won't for a momentadmit the possibility of forseeing the future?","Dead of Night"
"97",518080,519110,"Not for a moment.","Dead of Night"
"98",519600,522470,"Well, you'd say I was a pretty ordinary down to earthsort of person, wouldn't you?","Dead of Night"
"99",522720,524390,"I refuse to commit myself. Why?","Dead of Night"
"100",524640,529070,"Where it comes to seeing the future, something once happened to me that knocks your theory into a cocked hat.","Dead of Night"
"101",529680,533270,"Something, I'll not forget to my dying day ...Matter of fact, it very nearly was my dying day.","Dead of Night"
"102",544090,547310,"Now's my chance. I can't make it!","Dead of Night"
"103",549400,550200,"I can't make it!","Dead of Night"
"104",551370,554120,"One more time, passing!Let see...","Dead of Night"
"105",555610,556480,"This is it!","Dead of Night"
"106",559290,561400,"How long is it since the crash, nurse? Six days?","Dead of Night"
"107",561650,562600,"No, seven doctor.","Dead of Night"
"108",562850,567000,"- There's no injury to the brain. I'm certain- His mind cleared completely this morning.","Dead of Night"
"109",567250,571760,"He asked about the other driver. I told him he wasunhurt. He slept quite peacefully the next 2 hours","Dead of Night"
"110",572130,573690,"It's his temperature worries me.","Dead of Night"
"111",574020,576810,"Let me know at once if he wakes up again.I shall be in number 18.","Dead of Night"
"112",588180,591330,"You are here Peggy !All the way from Scotland?","Dead of Night"
"113",591860,593450,"All the way from Scotland.","Dead of Night"
"114",593780,596450,"But you're not Peggy, are you?","Dead of Night"
"115",596700,599450,"No, I awfully sorry.You've been calling me Peggy for days.","Dead of Night"
"116",599700,603290,"- My name is Joyce.- There's something sort of soothing about you.","Dead of Night"
"117",603620,605820,"- You're not going to leave me will you.- I won't.","Dead of Night"
"118",606070,609380,"- Promise?- Yes, if you promise to try and go quietly to sleep.","Dead of Night"
"119",609670,611340,"As you indicated.","Dead of Night"
"120",613430,616660,"From then on my temperature began to slideback to normal ...","Dead of Night"
"121",616910,619370,"to the grand job of nursing on Joyce's part.","Dead of Night"
"122",623430,625540,"Tell me frankly darling. Am I outof the wood yet?","Dead of Night"
"123",625790,630870,"Well, you've stopped being delirious. At least, I think so. It's hard to tell. You talk such nonsense. ...","Dead of Night"
"124",630920,635000,"- I still have awful bad nightmares.  - Nightmares? I thought you said you always dreamt about me","Dead of Night"
"125",635250,638360,"So I do. I dream you turn me down and getmarried to Dr Albury instead.","Dead of Night"
"126",638730,641600,"You needn't worry. He has a wife and3 children.","Dead of Night"
"127",641550,642600,"Oh, good for him!","Dead of Night"
"128",647950,649520,"It's a lovely night.","Dead of Night"
"129",659190,661360,"Quarter to ten,Long past your bedtime.","Dead of Night"
"130",661310,666010,"Listen darling, I'll put it to you. There's only one way to kill me permanently, and that's to marry me! It your professional duty.","Dead of Night"
"131",666260,673550,"- You've got a hope! Good night.- Good night ... darling.","Dead of Night"
"132",769970,772480,"Just room for one inside, sir.","Dead of Night"
"133",816940,819710,"Couldn't have been a dream. I didn't have timeto fall asleep.","Dead of Night"
"134",819850,823570,"- Nurse had only just left me.- Yes you checked the time. It was no more than 5 minutes.","Dead of Night"
"135",823730,827500,"- Does that mean I going crackers?- My dear chap, of course not.","Dead of Night"
"136",827830,831460,"In the split second before your car crashed, You were firmly convinced you were going to be killed, weren't you.","Dead of Night"
"137",832750,835780,"- Yes. Yes, I was.- That fear has remained with you.","Dead of Night"
"138",835830,838700,"I not conscious of it. Oh, you mean my subconscious mind","Dead of Night"
"139",838850,841410,"You'd already passed the purely physical crisis.","Dead of Night"
"140",841470,844940,"That apparition effect is what we call the psychological crisis.","Dead of Night"
"141",844990,847620,"Yes maybe. But suppose I go on seeing things?","Dead of Night"
"142",847670,851190,"You won't. In fact, I'll lay you 2 to 1 inpounds, we'll have you out of here in a week.","Dead of Night"
"143",851440,853150,"It's a bet. If I lose I win.","Dead of Night"
"144",855430,859120,"As a matter of fact, I won...That is I lost, if you see what I mean.","Dead of Night"
"145",859370,864440,"Albury was right. I made marvellous headway and was able to left the nursing home before the week was over.","Dead of Night"
"146",868690,870800,"Excuse me, can you tell methe time?","Dead of Night"
"147",870850,872440,"- Yes, it's quarter past four.- Thank you.","Dead of Night"
"148",878190,880450,"Just room for one inside, sir.","Dead of Night"
"149",911410,916060,"So you see, if I hadn't seen that man driving the hearse, I wouldn't be alive to tell the tale.","Dead of Night"
"150",916110,918380,"Bit sick for the passengers on the buswasn't it?","Dead of Night"
"151",918430,920740,"Yes, the hearse driver might have tippedthem off too!","Dead of Night"
"152",920790,925100,"Perhaps he did, dear. But perhaps they wereall doubting Thomases like Dr van Straaten","Dead of Night"
"153",925630,927780,"This time you have gotyour evidence doctor!","Dead of Night"
"154",927830,931550,"Mr. Grainger told the specialist about the hearse before he went to catch the bus.","Dead of Night"
"155",931610,935450,"I'm afraid that does not prove that the bus conductorhad the features of the hearse driver","Dead of Night"
"156",935610,938620,"... or that he said, ""There's room for one inside.""","Dead of Night"
"157",939190,940660,"But he had and he did.","Dead of Night"
"158",940910,944070,"Nothing will ever fix it. That hearse driverwas sent to me as a warning.","Dead of Night"
"159",944120,946150,"- I agree. Otherwise, why didn't he board the bus?- Exactly","Dead of Night"
"160",946640,948750,"Because he hadn't recovered completely yet.","Dead of Night"
"161",949120,954260,"Your were still upset by your crash. It made youreluctant to board any kind of vehicle, didn't it.","Dead of Night"
"162",954320,955830,"Sorry doctor, I'll not buy that one.","Dead of Night"
"163",955880,959150,"Well maybe it's as well.You cling to your beliefs my boy...","Dead of Night"
"164",959400,962790,"... that providence is speciallyconcerned about your survival.","Dead of Night"
"165",963220,966870,"It's no use Grainger. We're both in the same boat. We'll never convince him.","Dead of Night"
"166",967000,971600,"What Dr van Straaten wants is genuine first hand evidence. The kind that would satisfy judge and jury.","Dead of Night"
"167",971650,974160,"And neither of us are able toproduce that ...","Dead of Night"
"168",974810,975490,"...yet.","Dead of Night"
"169",976540,978510,"Darling, where on earthdid you spring from.","Dead of Night"
"170",978580,981350,"Brenda suddenly changed her mindabout staying up in town.","Dead of Night"
"171",981400,984460,"Would you pay the taxi, darling.I spent my last penny on the train fare.","Dead of Night"
"172",984510,986310,"- Hello Eliot.- Hello Joyce.","Dead of Night"
"173",986360,991100,"- Oh my dear, I am glad to see you ...- Your penniless brunette. Alright, I'll pay the taxi","Dead of Night"
"174",991200,994010,"...made it onto Charing Cross and just caught the 3:15","Dead of Night"
"175",994060,995800,"A delightful surprise, my dear...","Dead of Night"
"176",995850,997760,"...though no surprise to Mr Craig.","Dead of Night"
"177",997810,1001200,"Let me introduce you. Mr Craig Mrs Grainger,your dream come true.","Dead of Night"
"178",1001250,1003770,"Yes, she's the sixth person.","Dead of Night"
"179",1004400,1006500,"Sixth person. Are you playingsome sort of a game?","Dead of Night"
"180",1006580,1010800,"Well, not exactly a game, my dear.Mr Craig has been dreaming about you for years.","Dead of Night"
"181",1010870,1012890,"Well, not only you darling - allof us.","Dead of Night"
"182",1013540,1018350,"Come upstairs and take your things off. It's all perfectlysimple really. It's just like your husband's hearse.","Dead of Night"
"183",1018400,1022470,"I don't mean his hearse. I mean the one he saw when he was in your nursing home.","Dead of Night"
"184",1022520,1024950,"Or rather the one Dr van Straaten saidhe didn't see.","Dead of Night"
"185",1025000,1027250,"Oh dear, I think I had better start again.","Dead of Night"
"186",1027300,1030350,"You see, Mr Craig has been having the most dreadful dreams.","Dead of Night"
"187",1030400,1032530,"Penniless brunette laid onaccording to plan.","Dead of Night"
"188",1032600,1034080,"How's that for evidence doctor?","Dead of Night"
"189",1034130,1036030,"That's when you say it's a pure coincidence?","Dead of Night"
"190",1036080,1039440,"- Oh, you can't say that doctor.- The odds are a million to one against.","Dead of Night"
"191",1039590,1041700,"You know, I am a little indignant.","Dead of Night"
"192",1041950,1045980,"I am driven to the conclusion it's all partof a very carefully prearranged plan.","Dead of Night"
"193",1046030,1048850,"An extraordinarily elaborate practical jokeat my expense.","Dead of Night"
"194",1048900,1052020,"- Oh really!  - Do you seriously thinkwe'd cook the whole thing up between us?","Dead of Night"
"195",1052070,1056050,"Well as an explanation, it's not any more farfetched than Mr Craig's.","Dead of Night"
"196",1056100,1058910,"Then the jokes on me too,for I didn't know anything about it","Dead of Night"
"197",1059000,1061160,"A funny sort of practical joke. It isn't funny.","Dead of Night"
"198",1061210,1064080,"What conceivable motive do youthink we possibly could have had?","Dead of Night"
"199",1064220,1069790,"Ah! No doubt you thought it would be very amusing towatch my cherished disbeliefs being shattered.","Dead of Night"
"200",1069700,1072240,"Mmm. Very clever of us, I must say.","Dead of Night"
"201",1072300,1075390,"I wonder if we have any more surprisesup our sleeves?","Dead of Night"
"202",1075250,1077150,"That's it. Your glasses.","Dead of Night"
"203",1078260,1079500,"What about my glasses?","Dead of Night"
"204",1079860,1082370,"Later on, we're having drinks ...","Dead of Night"
"205",1082430,1087750,"You break those glasses of yours, and thenquite suddenly the room goes dark.","Dead of Night"
"206",1087830,1092880,"Then, Foley, you say something ... somethingabout the death of a man I've never heard of.","Dead of Night"
"207",1093390,1095850,"And that's where my dream becomes a nightmare...","Dead of Night"
"208",1096120,1097640,"... a nightmare of horror.","Dead of Night"
"209",1097700,1100170,"Horror? What sort of horror?","Dead of Night"
"210",1100220,1102880,"I feel my will power draining away.","Dead of Night"
"211",1103100,1107830,"I feel I'm in the grip of a force that's drivingme towards something unspeakably evil.","Dead of Night"
"212",1107880,1110430,"It shows that you have some heavyweight on your conscience.","Dead of Night"
"213",1110520,1112090,"Now, in my opinion ...","Dead of Night"
"214",1112140,1116950,"I am no longer interested in your opinion.You shook me at first with your ingenious theories.","Dead of Night"
"215",1117000,1119640,"I thought perhaps the whole thing wasa delusion.","Dead of Night"
"216",1119700,1122550,"But Mrs Grainger's arrival has alteredall this.","Dead of Night"
"217",1122600,1125620,"I have been here beforein my dream.","Dead of Night"
"218",1125670,1128800,"For some reason, I've been givenforeknowledge of the future","Dead of Night"
"219",1129000,1130450,"Why?","Dead of Night"
"220",1130500,1133200,"I don't know.I want to know.","Dead of Night"
"221",1133250,1134990,"I must know.","Dead of Night"
"222",1139760,1143270,"Sally, dear, I think perhaps it's time you were going off home now.","Dead of Night"
"223",1143550,1146370,"Mother means she wouldn't want yourinfant mind warped, my pretty.","Dead of Night"
"224",1146430,1150420,"- I'm sorry, Sally. I didn't want mean my fear to frighten you.- You're all right, Mr Craig, it didn't.","Dead of Night"
"225",1150470,1152980,"All the same, I'll go if you like...","Dead of Night"
"226",1153030,1156270,"But it seems rather silly to me, consideringlike last time I saw them.","Dead of Night"
"227",1156370,1157170,"Some what?","Dead of Night"
"228",1157220,1161570,"Subconscious thingamajigs, or whatever Dr van Straaten would say that they are","Dead of Night"
"229",1161620,1163940,"I had an absolutely staggering one. Last year.","Dead of Night"
"230",1164000,1166240,"Save it up for the school magazine.I'll go and run you along home.","Dead of Night"
"231",1166300,1169600,"Thanks for the nice tea, Eliot, and forcalling me a liar. Good afternoon","Dead of Night"
"232",1169650,1173650,"Please let her stay, Mrs Foley. I shouldlike to hear about your subconscious thingamajigs.","Dead of Night"
"233",1174100,1176860,"You would? Not that it'll cut any ice with you.","Dead of Night"
"234",1177220,1180430,"Well, we were spending Christmasdown in Somerset.","Dead of Night"
"235",1180500,1183670,"I'd been asked over to a party by anold school friend of my mother's.","Dead of Night"
"236",1183720,1186720,"A Mrs Watson.There were a lot of other kids there.","Dead of Night"
"237",1186780,1190740,"Mostly younger than Jimmy Watson and I wereso we let them choose the games.","Dead of Night"
"238",1198810,1201720,"Nobody else could have such a silly nose.It's Jimmy.","Dead of Night"
"239",1202730,1204760,"Ah, you should talk.","Dead of Night"
"240",1209200,1210860,"What shall we play now?","Dead of Night"
"241",1212330,1215600,"- Sardines- All right, sardines, it is.","Dead of Night"
"242",1215680,1220370,"- Sardines?  - Don't you know aboutsardines? It's a sort of hide and seek.","Dead of Night"
"243",1221000,1224110,"Who's to hide?Alright.","Dead of Night"
"244",1224320,1227120,"Now anywhere in the house bar the kitchen.Cook's in a state.","Dead of Night"
"245",1227180,1230370,"- But I don't know my way about the house.- So much the worse for you.","Dead of Night"
"246",1230420,1233630,"I'll count 30.Turn your backs every one.","Dead of Night"
"247",1263000,1266080,"Off you go. Come on quickly!","Dead of Night"

"250",1275850,1280470,"I'll pack here with you. When somebody elsefinds us, they pack in too, like sardines.","Dead of Night"
"251",1280520,1282480,"Oh, its cold, in here.","Dead of Night"
"252",1282540,1285810,"Cold eh? That better?","Dead of Night"
"253",1286460,1290890,"No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold frombeyond the grave..","Dead of Night"
"254",1290920,1292240,"What are you talking about?","Dead of Night"
"255",1292680,1295730,"Believe it or not, this house in haunted.","Dead of Night"
"256",1295960,1297200,"I don't believe it.","Dead of Night"
"257",1297260,1299820,"Well everyone around this partof the world says it is.","Dead of Night"
"258",1299880,1301400,"I'll bite. Tell me!","Dead of Night"
"259",1302450,1308110,"Shh, they're bound to find us here.Oh, I know a much better place. Come on.","Dead of Night"
"260",1317200,1318810,"Go on about your precious ghost.","Dead of Night"
"261",1318860,1323750,"Well, there was a murder committedhere in 1860, I think it was. Come on.","Dead of Night"
"262",1324660,1325490,"The girl who did it...","Dead of Night"
"263",1325540,1329720,"must have been crackers, I suppose really,Strangled him and then half cut his head off.","Dead of Night"
"264",1329930,1331910,"- How revolting.- Course, there's lots more...","Dead of Night"
"265",1332100,1336030,"- ... but, you're too young.- And where does the ghost come in?","Dead of Night"
"266",1336420,1341140,"Well, I don't know really. Nobody's heard or seen anything actually. We've been here 6 months.","Dead of Night"
"267",1341340,1345620,"I expect it's the girl goingaround in a long white nightgown.","Dead of Night"
"268",1345820,1347380,"Whistling winds...","Dead of Night"
"269",1349430,1351120,"Clanking chains...","Dead of Night"
"270",1352250,1353520,"Blood curdling screams.","Dead of Night"
"271",1353730,1356500,"I suppose she's seeking forgivenessfor her crime.","Dead of Night"

"287",1467650,1470000,"Why? Is she unkind to you darling?","Dead of Night"
"288",1470560,1472900,"She hates me. She said she'dlike to kill me.","Dead of Night"
"289",1473620,1475800,"Oh don't. You poor little thing.","Dead of Night"

"299",1553100,1556140,"There you are! I was wonderingwhere on earth you'd got to.","Dead of Night"
"300",1556200,1560520,"I found another door behind the wardrobe,went along a corridor and then into the room at the end.","Dead of Night"
"301",1560600,1564800,"Oh there! But that's where thewhole thing happened. Hi! Sally!","Dead of Night"
"302",1567890,1569870,"Meet your new Nanny, Mrs Watson!","Dead of Night"
"303",1569930,1570900,"What do you mean dear?","Dead of Night"
"304",1571000,1574910,"I found myself in a sort of nursery.I didn't know any of the children were staying the night.","Dead of Night"
"305",1574970,1576110,"Staying the night.?","Dead of Night"
"306",1576160,1579540,"Why yes. This little boy said he wassharing a room with a sister.","Dead of Night"
"307",1579700,1581000,"Which little boy?","Dead of Night"
"308",1581050,1583920,"He told me his name was ... was um ...","Dead of Night"
"309",1584400,1585880,"Francis Kent.","Dead of Night"
"310",1586050,1590130,"- Francis Kent?- Come off it Sally. So you knew all the time.","Dead of Night"
"311",1590200,1591380,"Knew what?","Dead of Night"
"312",1591440,1594910,"About Constance Kent murderingher brother, Francis, of course.","Dead of Night"
"313",1595420,1599100,"I didn't know. So that ... that little boy was ....","Dead of Night"
"314",1600220,1602880,"I'm not frightened ...I'm not frightened.","Dead of Night"
"315",1604120,1606610,"Oh! Please hold me tight ... ohhold me tight.","Dead of Night"
"316",1609920,1614290,"Mother said I must be sickening for something, andmade me stay in bed with three hot water bottles.","Dead of Night"
"317",1614440,1617620,"She didn't believe a word of it,anymore than Dr van Straaten does.","Dead of Night"
"318",1617760,1622700,"In the past of course that type of experiencewas then frequent among saints.","Dead of Night"
"319",1622900,1628700,"St Joan, for example, and St Theresa record some visitations of an exceedingly tangible character","Dead of Night"
"320",1628750,1631960,"- I'm in jolly good company then.- Not at all my dear.","Dead of Night"
"321",1632010,1635910,"I decline to believe that you are on suchan exalted spiritual plane.","Dead of Night"
"322",1636110,1640880,"I think you are all being ridiculously weak mindedletting Dr van Straaten lay down the law.","Dead of Night"
"323",1641190,1646210,"When I was a nurse, I came across a lot of thingsthat doctors didn't just dismiss in an airy fashion.","Dead of Night"
"324",1646460,1649430,"I believe in Sally's storyand in Mr Craig's dream.","Dead of Night"
"325",1649780,1650900,"Good for you, darling!","Dead of Night"
"326",1651100,1654340,"So we're all powerless in grip of Craig's dream.That's a solemn thought!","Dead of Night"
"327",1654400,1655950,"I think it's awfully exciting","Dead of Night"
"328",1656000,1659750,"Well, if I am a puppet and Mr Craig's pulling the strings.","Dead of Night"
"329",1659800,1662850,"The least he can do is to tell me a little bit more about the part","Dead of Night"
"330",1662900,1666350,"-... he's giving me to play.- I wish it were as easy as that.","Dead of Night"
"331",1667440,1671370,"Trying to remember a dreamis like, how shall I put it, ...","Dead of Night"
"332",1672380,1674300,"Being out at nightin a thunderstorm.","Dead of Night"
"333",1674680,1679700,"There's a flash of lightning and for one brief moment, everything stands out vivid and starkly.","Dead of Night"
"334",1679800,1682720,"And what have the lightning flashesilluminated so far?","Dead of Night"
"335",1682810,1687740,"One thing is very vivid and very horrible.I hit Sally savagely, viciously.","Dead of Night"
"336",1687820,1691460,"Oh no you won't, I shall stick close to Mr Grainger. He's bigger than you.","Dead of Night"
"337",1692590,1697000,"But anyway, it isn't consistent. I shan't have a chance to, because you leave here quite soon.","Dead of Night"
"338",1697190,1698080,"Quite suddenly.","Dead of Night"
"339",1698370,1701000,"- You're certain of that?- Absolutely certain.","Dead of Night"
"340",1701050,1704900,"Splendid. Then I suggest Sally stays to dinner. That'll break the spell.","Dead of Night"
"341",1705090,1706490,"An admirable suggestion.","Dead of Night"
"342",1706550,1710850,"- It's absolutely thrilling. I'll ring Mum and get her OK.- Tell her, Eliot will run you back in the car.","Dead of Night"
"343",1710900,1712050,"Mother!","Dead of Night"
"344",1712100,1716400,"Really Sally, this is too bad! Oh, good afternoonMrs Foley, do please forgive this invasion.","Dead of Night"
"345",1716600,1721900,"You know quite well, it's your Uncle Edwin's birthday. Well actually, he's her godfather, but she always calls him uncle, you understand.","Dead of Night"
"346",1722020,1725900,"And not to leave a message or anything, but of course Iguessed you'd be here. Must be a thorough nuisance.","Dead of Night"
"347",1725960,1727800,"Now come along rush dear,we are hours late","Dead of Night"
"348",1727850,1731590,"But mother, I can't! You see this is Mr Craig,and I'm one of the characters in his dream.","Dead of Night"
"349",1731740,1735250,"Oh, how do you do. Such fun charades.Still, you do understand don't you?","Dead of Night"
"350",1735300,1737450,"And poor Edwin's so terribly sensitive.Now come along dear.","Dead of Night"
"351",1737500,1740860,"Mother, you must listen. You seeMr Craig is going to hit me savagely.","Dead of Night"
"352",1740910,1745870,"Oh, well I'm sure he can hit somebody else instead. Now comealong dear. Don't forget you're dining with us on Tuesday.","Dead of Night"
"353",1749060,1753310,"- That'll teach you to mess about with Mr Craig's dream, Ma.- Oh really, I don't know what to say.","Dead of Night"
"354",1753460,1758300,"I am surprised Mr Craig didn't rememberSally's mother. She seems to me most memorable.","Dead of Night"
"355",1758400,1763320,"Now look doctor, if Craig had told you she was coming andexactly what she'd be wearing and the very words she'd say","Dead of Night"
"356",1763570,1765380,"You would still have thoughtthe dream was all baloney.","Dead of Night"
"357",1765450,1766570,"Good for you, darling!","Dead of Night"
"358",1766620,1771610,"I'm becoming quite alarmed, by the end of thisevening, I shall be just as credulous as any of you.","Dead of Night"
"359",1772980,1778670,"Mr Craig, I can only say the more incredulousthe doctor becomes, the more I believe you.","Dead of Night"
"360",1778800,1782370,"- Thank you.- Doctor, I hoped you'd be able to explain to me.","Dead of Night"
"361",1782420,1785410,"... a happening, which to put itmildly, has always puzzled me.","Dead of Night"
"362",1785600,1786770,"I shall try.","Dead of Night"
"363",1787660,1792600,"It started a few weeks after we became engaged.It was April 9th, to be exact.","Dead of Night"
"364",1793060,1795290,"I remember the date, becauseit was Peter's birthday.","Dead of Night"
"365",1795900,1799780,"You know how difficult it is choosing presents for a man.They always seem to have everything they want.","Dead of Night"
"366",1808400,1812860,"- Oh hello darling.- Hello Peter. Take it through will you.","Dead of Night"
"367",1814750,1817350,"- What on earth's that?- A little birthday present.","Dead of Night"
"368",1818070,1819380,"Put it on the couch will you.","Dead of Night"
"369",1819870,1822700,"- What is it, a kite?- Why don't you open it and see.","Dead of Night"
"370",1823000,1824620,"Right. Suppose you fix us a drink.","Dead of Night"
"371",1830700,1832220,"You haven't gone and had yourportrait painted, have you?","Dead of Night"
"372",1832480,1835390,"No. I thought you'd liketo look at yourself.","Dead of Night"
"373",1841080,1843190,"- Darling, it's a beauty.- You really like it?","Dead of Night"
"374",1843300,1846760,"- Love it.  - Well it's certainly an improvementon that barbolla thing your aunt gave you.","Dead of Night"
"375",1846860,1851310,"Yes, that is pretty grim. I always felt I was lookingat a gift horse in the mouth. This is a honey.","Dead of Night"
"376",1851310,1852720,"Where did you find it?","Dead of Night"
"377",1852800,1856270,"Chichester. Very expensive.Happy birthday darling!","Dead of Night"
"378",1858140,1861770,"- What sort of journey did you have?- Came by road. Got a lift.","Dead of Night"
"379",1862030,1864660,"Don't tell me - let me guess...Not old faithful?","Dead of Night"
"380",1865030,1866080,"The same.","Dead of Night"
"381",1866690,1869120,"Poor old Guy. What will he do whenwe get married.","Dead of Night"
"382",1869500,1871200,"Hardly the big game shooting type is he?","Dead of Night"
"383",1871330,1874800,"Hardly. He nearly put us into a ditch coming up, trying to avoid a rabbit.","Dead of Night"
"384",1875050,1876400,"Fellow feeling obviously.","Dead of Night"
"385",1876890,1879400,"You be careful. I'm very fondof that.","Dead of Night"
"386",1880290,1883760,"You mean it's easy with your disgustingfeminine vanity to have him on a string.","Dead of Night"
"387",1884110,1885720,"A spaniel would do just as well.","Dead of Night"
"388",1885790,1890570,"- Mmm. Spaniels don't have nice comfortable Bentleys, do they.- You've got something there.","Dead of Night"
"389",1893440,1894090,"How's that?","Dead of Night"
"390",1895280,1896500,"Most professional.","Dead of Night"
"391",1897500,1899610,"I'm glad to see you're goingto be useful about the house.","Dead of Night"
"392",1903380,1904360,"Handsome couple!","Dead of Night"
"393",1906840,1908030,"What's that?","Dead of Night"
"394",1908460,1910690,"Nothing. I thought I saw something.","Dead of Night"
"395",1910640,1911510,"What sort of something?","Dead of Night"
"396",1911960,1913450,"Don't know quite.","Dead of Night"
"397",1913500,1915450,"What a little man about so high in a bowler hat?","Dead of Night"
"398",1915740,1918610,"- What have you been drinking for lunch?- One pint of bitter.","Dead of Night"
"399",1919900,1924340,"- You know I think I've been very generous.- So do I. Nicest present I've ever had.","Dead of Night"
"400",1925790,1929000,"- What shall we do tonight? Dress up.Spend a lot of money?  - Why not?","Dead of Night"
"401",1962320,1966120,"- You've almost worn out those stairs.- Well, we've danced enough anyway.","Dead of Night"
"402",1975760,1977210,"Darling, is anything the matter?","Dead of Night"
"403",1977540,1979050,"No. Why?","Dead of Night"
"404",1979400,1982310,"I don't know. You seem to bea bit broody all evening.","Dead of Night"
"405",1982770,1984160,"A bit limp with the heat, I expect.","Dead of Night"
"406",1984610,1987560,"- Sure, there's nothing the matter?- No nothing really.","Dead of Night"
"407",1988260,1991370,"That usually means there is something really.What is it?","Dead of Night"
"408",1992620,1995280,"- It sounds so damn silly.- Nevermind. Tell me.","Dead of Night"
"409",1995860,2000630,"Well, you know that mirror you gave me ... didn't get it at one of those joke shops, by any chance?","Dead of Night"
"410",2000780,2002270,"No, of course not. Why?","Dead of Night"
"411",2002660,2008410,"Well, when I was dressing this evening, just as I was tying my tie, I suddenly realised the reflection was all wrong","Dead of Night"
"412",2008760,2010130,"What do you mean ""wrong""?","Dead of Night"
"413",2010180,2013300,"Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing.It was some other room.","Dead of Night"
"414",2013490,2016180,"- Darling!- I told you it sounded silly.","Dead of Night"
"415",2016330,2018940,"It only lasted for a moment, butI could have sworn I saw it.","Dead of Night"
"416",2019090,2021620,"Some sort of optical illusion, I suppose.","Dead of Night"
"417",2022110,2023900,"All done with mirrors, in fact.","Dead of Night"
"418",2096640,2099170,"The next few weeks we were prettybusy house hunting.","Dead of Night"
"419",2099430,2101910,"In the end we found quite apleasant house in Chelsea.","Dead of Night"
"420",2102010,2105040,"And of course, I had all the usual chaosgetting ready for the wedding.","Dead of Night"
"421",2105340,2108930,"I noticed that Peter seemed preoccupied anda bit jumpy and irritable.","Dead of Night"
"422",2109180,2111480,"But I thought it was justeve of wedding nerves.","Dead of Night"
"423",2112140,2115030,"Anyhow, I was so busy I didn't havetime to think much about it.","Dead of Night"
"424",2118420,2123570,"What a day. Helen's got measles, blast her, so I willhave to try and find another bridesmaid somewhere.","Dead of Night"
"425",2124120,2126930,"The cakes under control, andI've got lots more answers.","Dead of Night"
"426",2126980,2131410,"The Laughtons can't come thank heaven.We've got some perfectly frightful presents.","Dead of Night"
"427",2131460,2135240,"You know darling, I really think we have to turnthat spare room of ours into a chamber of horrors.","Dead of Night"
"428",2136010,2138520,"Which reminds me - when arethe men coming to lay the carpet.","Dead of Night"
"429",2139910,2141560,"Oh, I don't know.I forgot to ring up.","Dead of Night"
"430",2141670,2147060,"Oh really darling, here am I getting worn out chasing around gettingthings done and you can't even remember a simple little telephone call.","Dead of Night"
"431",2147590,2149240,"For heaven's sake, don't nag.","Dead of Night"
"432",2151890,2153480,"Sorry. I didn't mean to say that.","Dead of Night"
"433",2155790,2159280,"Peter, what's the matter with you?You've been edgy for days.","Dead of Night"
"434",2159670,2160600,"Yes, I know.","Dead of Night"
"435",2161350,2162880,"I haven't been sleeping too well.","Dead of Night"
"436",2166130,2167730,"I really am sorry darling.","Dead of Night"
"437",2169100,2171470,"Oh, it doesn't matter.Forget it.","Dead of Night"
"438",2180140,2183730,"Listen darling, I know you fairly well by now.You're keeping something from me.","Dead of Night"
"439",2184320,2185090,"What is it?","Dead of Night"
"440",2187260,2190310,"Well, if you must know,it's that mirror.","Dead of Night"
"441",2190980,2195030,"You remember me telling you that first evening.Well, it's got worse.","Dead of Night"
"442",2195660,2199640,"Much worse. Every time I look in it nowI see that room.","Dead of Night"
"443",2200050,2204160,"It's getting me down.I'd really rather not talk about it.","Dead of Night"
"444",2204210,2208030,"You'll feel much better if you do.It's no good bottling things up you know.","Dead of Night"
"445",2211000,2216960,"Well, at first, if I made anenormous effort of will.","Dead of Night"
"446",2217220,2219890,"The reflection used to change backto what it ought to be.","Dead of Night"
"447",2221180,2226070,"But lately, however hard I try,it doesn't change anymore.","Dead of Night"
"448",2227380,2228870,"The only thing to do ...","Dead of Night"
"449",2228920,2230740,"... is to try not to look in it at all.","Dead of Night"
"450",2232030,2234240,"But in a queer sort of wayit fascinates me.","Dead of Night"
"451",2234630,2237520,"I feel as if that room,the one in the mirror ...","Dead of Night"
"452",2237870,2241170,"... were trying to ... to claim me,","Dead of Night"
"453",2241320,2243460,"... to draw me into it.","Dead of Night"
"454",2245100,2249540,"It almost becomes the real roomand my own bedroom imaginary.","Dead of Night"
"455",2252860,2257620,"And I know there's something waiting for me on the other side of the mirror.","Dead of Night"
"456",2258740,2262230,"Something evil ...monstrously evil.","Dead of Night"
"457",2263900,2268430,"And that if I cross that dividing line,something awful will happen.","Dead of Night"
"458",2274360,2276190,"Well let's get rid of the beastly thing.","Dead of Night"
"459",2276540,2279130,"You know you don't have to keep itjust because I've given it to you.","Dead of Night"
"460",2279380,2281190,"I can take it back and they'll change it.","Dead of Night"
"461",2281280,2285160,"The trouble is not in the mirror.It's in my mind. It must be.","Dead of Night"
"462",2286140,2288070,"A mirror's just wood and glass.","Dead of Night"
"463",2289170,2291720,"Peter, I don't know what to say.","Dead of Night"
"464",2292570,2294990,"Perhaps, you're overworked.Why don't you see a doctor?","Dead of Night"
"465",2295040,2297670,"I have. He couldn'tfind anything wrong with me.","Dead of Night"
"466",2298030,2301800,"- I think I shall have to go and see a mental specialist.- Oh nonsense! You're as sane as I am.","Dead of Night"
"467",2301850,2303600,"Obviously, I can't be.","Dead of Night"
"468",2309500,2313320,"Listen ... I've been putting off saying this.","Dead of Night"
"469",2313320,2315440,"But I think we ought to postponethe wedding.","Dead of Night"
"470",2317510,2321370,"- That's a bit drastic isn't it.- I don't know. Suppose I am going mad.","Dead of Night"
"471",2321600,2323300,"Wouldn't be much fun for you, would it?","Dead of Night"
"472",2323500,2325300,"Take you 5 years to get a divorce.","Dead of Night"
"473",2325400,2327800,"Really darling, you're goinga little bit too fast for me.","Dead of Night"
"474",2328100,2331690,"Let's get the wedding over, and then we can start making divorce arrangements afterwards.","Dead of Night"
"475",2336500,2338410,"Peter, come with me will you.","Dead of Night"
"476",2348160,2352000,"Look in the mirror.Look in the mirror.","Dead of Night"
"477",2357150,2358470,"What is it, darling?","Dead of Night"
"478",2360010,2361020,"It's worse than ever.","Dead of Night"
"479",2364460,2366400,"- You're not there.- But of course I'm there.","Dead of Night"
"480",2366500,2369780,"I tell you, you're not.In the other room, I'm alone.","Dead of Night"
"481",2372800,2375250,"Look in the mirror and tell meexactly what you see.","Dead of Night"
"482",2382600,2383970,"It's just as it always is.","Dead of Night"
"483",2385120,2387410,"Instead of my bed,there's the other bed.","Dead of Night"
"484",2388080,2389500,"I see it quite clearly.","Dead of Night"
"485",2390520,2395200,"The posts have vine leaves twisted aroundthem, with bunches of grapes at the top.","Dead of Night"
"486",2396120,2398050,"The hangings are dark red silk...","Dead of Night"
"487",2398800,2400870,"The walls are panelled.","Dead of Night"
"488",2401280,2403070,"There's a log fire burning in the grate.","Dead of Night"
"489",2403760,2404970,"It's no use I tell you.","Dead of Night"
"490",2405120,2406400,"I am going mad.","Dead of Night"
"491",2408940,2410500,"Now listen to what I see...","Dead of Night"
"492",2411400,2414540,"No four poster, no panelling,and no log fire.","Dead of Night"
"493",2414790,2417480,"Just your ordinary roomwith you and me in it.","Dead of Night"
"494",2418990,2419950,"Listen to me...","Dead of Night"
"495",2420510,2424000,"... you're going to look in this mirror again.You're going to see exactly the same as I do.","Dead of Night"
"496",2424920,2427200,"Come here. Come here.","Dead of Night"
"497",2433110,2436000,"- Can you see your own room?- No","Dead of Night"
"498",2436050,2438400,"- Or me?- No.","Dead of Night"
"499",2438490,2440730,"But you must!Make yourself.","Dead of Night"
"500",2441020,2442070,"I can't.","Dead of Night"
"501",2442230,2444220,"You can darling, if you try.","Dead of Night"
"502",2445040,2447220,"- It's no good.- You can.","Dead of Night"
"503",2447450,2449120,"Look, there I am.","Dead of Night"
"504",2449270,2450510,"Standing by you.","Dead of Night"
"505",2456690,2457700,"Yes...","Dead of Night"
"506",2459200,2460410,"Yes, there you are.","Dead of Night"
"507",2461550,2462870,"I can see you now.","Dead of Night"
"508",2463120,2465280,"You see?I told you so!","Dead of Night"
"509",2468640,2472400,"- I can't make it out.- Come on, let's get out of here and have a drink.","Dead of Night"
"510",2473920,2478950,"So that seemed to be that. A fortnight later,we got married and moved into the new house","Dead of Night"
"511",2479340,2484300,"In a way, I didn't mind getting rid of the mirrorBut Peter said it was complete nonsense to be scared of it.","Dead of Night"
"512",2484350,2486330,"So I decided to let things be.","Dead of Night"
"513",2493400,2497000,"Mother says, can we come down theweekend after next. It's her birthday.","Dead of Night"
"514",2498120,2501000,"Afraid, I shan't be able to make it.We'll be rushing that big audit through.","Dead of Night"
"515",2501200,2504100,"Oh well, nevermind. She'll be disappointed but we can go some other time.","Dead of Night"
"516",2504410,2506520,"Well you can go, sweet, anyhoweven if I can't.","Dead of Night"
"517",2506770,2508210,"I don't want to go without you.","Dead of Night"
"518",2508320,2510930,"Don't want you to. But yourmother would rather have you alone.","Dead of Night"
"519",2511770,2514330,"You know, getting her preciousdaughter back for a few days.","Dead of Night"
"520",2514470,2518440,"Don't be an idiot. She doesn't feel she'slost a daughter. She's gained a son.","Dead of Night"
"521",2518640,2520280,"What gift for a phrase you have.","Dead of Night"
"522",2521850,2523000,"Go over, anyhow.","Dead of Night"
"523",2529040,2531000,"- Hello?- Hello Peter","Dead of Night"
"524",2531150,2533000,"Oh hello darling. Have a good journey?","Dead of Night"
"525",2533200,2536290,"- Yes. I wish you could have come.- So do I. Still it can't be helped.","Dead of Night"
"526",2536440,2539370,"- Do you miss me?- Of course I do. Do you miss me?","Dead of Night"
"527",2539450,2543210,"- Yes. Gone to bed yet?- No, I'm going to do another half hours work first.","Dead of Night"
"528",2543500,2547650,"- Well good night darling.  - Good night darling.See you Monday. Give my love to your mother.","Dead of Night"
"529",2576500,2579110,"- Your number?- Flaxman 6061.","Dead of Night"
"530",2579400,2583700,"Get me Chichester 2352.Thank you.","Dead of Night"
"531",2616420,2617450,"What is it dear?","Dead of Night"
"532",2618080,2619030,"Nothing.","Dead of Night"
"533",2620600,2624180,"Mother, I want to speak with Mr Rutherford.Would you go on to the library, and then walk back this way?","Dead of Night"
"534",2624230,2625360,"Very well, dear.","Dead of Night"
"535",2632150,2636560,"- Morning Mr Rutherford.- Good morning Miss Watts. I beg your pardon, Mrs Courtland.","Dead of Night"
"536",2636710,2639900,"Do you remember that Chippendale mirrorI bought here about 3 months ago.","Dead of Night"
"537",2640000,2642340,"Indeed I do. I hope yourhusband was satisfied with it.","Dead of Night"
"538",2642400,2644300,"Yes, very.Tell me ...","Dead of Night"
"539",2645600,2647600,"That bed. The four poster...","Dead of Night"
"540",2647840,2652750,"How odd that you should mention it. Why, it so happens, I bought it at the same sale that I got your mirror.","Dead of Night"
"541",2653410,2656360,"There's a curious history attaching to them both.","Dead of Night"
"542",2656860,2659690,"- Curious?- Well, tragic perhaps I should say.","Dead of Night"
"543",2659940,2661850,"I trust, by the way, thatyou are not superstitious.","Dead of Night"
"544",2662200,2664660,"No ... No I don't think so.","Dead of Night"
"545",2664940,2666050,"Won't you sit down.","Dead of Night"
"546",2667200,2671460,"Some people would think it possible that I shouldbe lying with regard to these matters.","Dead of Night"
"547",2671510,2672940,"Please, Mr Rutherford, will youtell me the story.","Dead of Night"
"548",2673130,2674240,"I'm very interested.","Dead of Night"
"549",2674390,2675370,"By all means.","Dead of Night"
"550",2675670,2679780,"The bed and mirror form part of the contents of the private apartments ...","Dead of Night"
"551",2680130,2684800,"... of a Mr Francis Etherington,who died at Marsden Lacy in 1836.","Dead of Night"
"552",2685150,2690790,"The apartment has remained unused andlocked from that time until the sale.","Dead of Night"
"553",2692000,2693590,"That is his portrait, by the way.","Dead of Night"
"554",2694420,2696090,"He was a man of dominating character.","Dead of Night"
"555",2696840,2701860,"Arrogant, fractious,handsome and of a violent temper.","Dead of Night"
"556",2702360,2705350,"He married a very beautiful heiress.A Miss Perott.","Dead of Night"
"557",2705700,2709190,"The couple retired to Marsden Lacy where they livedcontentedly for a time.","Dead of Night"
"558",2709440,2713000,"Then suddenly disaster overtook them.","Dead of Night"
"559",2713320,2717370,"Out hunting one day, Etherington was thrownby his horse, which then rolled on him.","Dead of Night"
"560",2717520,2719180,"His spine was injured.","Dead of Night"
"561",2719230,2723010,"He was never again able to do more thandrag himself a few paces from this bed.","Dead of Night"
"562",2723810,2724620,"How dreadful.","Dead of Night"
"563",2724670,2730270,"Yes. Unfortunately the effects of suchconstraint on a man of his enormous energy...","Dead of Night"
"564",2730320,2732550,"Was more than his mind could endure.","Dead of Night"
"565",2733040,2737050,"He became morose and bittersuspicious above all of his wife.","Dead of Night"
"566",2737100,2740640,"Quite without reason, he beganaccusing the poor lady of betraying him.","Dead of Night"
"567",2741070,2746620,"With his friends ... with strangers ...with his servants.","Dead of Night"
"568",2747390,2752890,"Had she not been so devoted to him, she certainly would have left him, and indeed it would have been better for her had she done so.","Dead of Night"
"569",2753900,2757700,"For one day, in an excess of jealous rage","Dead of Night"
"570",2758600,2762610,"He strangled her, and thensat down in front of the mirror...","Dead of Night"
"571",2763700,2765210,"your mirror...","Dead of Night"
"572",2766140,2768330,"and cut his throat.","Dead of Night"
"573",2771600,2773310,"What a horrible story.","Dead of Night"
"574",2775000,2779620,"Then the mirror ...hadn't been used again until Peter...","Dead of Night"
"575",2781840,2784840,"- ... until I bought it for my husband.- Exactly.","Dead of Night"
"576",2791700,2798530,"Peter. Peter. Peter darling.Oh there you are!","Dead of Night"
"577",2800350,2802780,"Something gone wrong withyour plans for a weekend?","Dead of Night"
"578",2807080,2810170,"- Darling, what do you mean?- You know what I mean.","Dead of Night"
"579",2812160,2814590,"I haven't the faintest ideawhat you're talking about.","Dead of Night"
"580",2815200,2816390,"Of course you haven't.","Dead of Night"
"581",2817460,2821570,"Of course, you didn't think I suspected anything,when you were so eager to go away without me.","Dead of Night"
"582",2822110,2825110,"Well, I'm not a fool.I knew what your game was.","Dead of Night"
"583",2825900,2829120,"Darling, stop please.Sit down and listen to me.","Dead of Night"
"584",2829180,2833710,"I will not sit down. I know you'd like to have me chainedto this chair and to have me chained to this room.","Dead of Night"
"585",2834160,2837280,"But I won't stand it, not while I've strength to move at all.","Dead of Night"
"586",2837340,2839970,"Darling, sit down and listen to me.You're not well.","Dead of Night"
"587",2840030,2842540,"And a good thing for you andyour precious lover that I'm not.","Dead of Night"
"588",2843230,2846320,"I can move out of this roomand break him in pieces.","Dead of Night"
"589",2846570,2848900,"Peter, it's the mirror. I've found outwhat's wrong with the mirror.","Dead of Night"
"590",2853170,2856800,"There's nothing wrong with the mirror.I look in it often.","Dead of Night"
"591",2857790,2859970,"I sit here and lookat these four walls.","Dead of Night"
"592",2860070,2863200,"Then for a change I look at them in the mirror.","Dead of Night"
"593",2868910,2870120,"You don't know what you're saying!","Dead of Night"
"594",2870470,2875550,"This isn't Marsden Lacy. Your name isn't Etherington.It's Cortland, Peter Cortland and I'm your wife.","Dead of Night"
"595",2875620,2880000,"Exactly, you're my wife, butyou sometimes choose to forget it.","Dead of Night"
"596",2880500,2883200,"Well? What's the matter?Why did you come back?","Dead of Night"
"597",2884350,2886130,"No, let me guess.","Dead of Night"
"598",2886380,2890000,"You were enjoying a pleasant weekendwith Guy, but he was called away.","Dead of Night"
"599",2890050,2891730,"So you had to come back to me.","Dead of Night"
"600",2892980,2895100,"Peter, I haven't even seen Guy.","Dead of Night"
"601",2895440,2897890,"Anyhow, you know we've always treated himas a joke.","Dead of Night"
"602",2898200,2902400,"Yes, I know we've always treated him as a joke.But I knew what was going all the time.","Dead of Night"
"603",2902480,2905150,"Nothing's been going on.You know that as well as I do.","Dead of Night"
"604",2905800,2909520,"I pretended not to notice, day after day...","Dead of Night"
"605",2909680,2913150,"... month after month.While you were making a public laughing stock of me.","Dead of Night"
"606",2913950,2916500,"But this time, I've had enoughI going to punish you ...","Dead of Night"
"607",2916600,2918410,"as you deserve to be punished.","Dead of Night"
"608",2920800,2924250,"Peter. It's the mirror. Mr Rutherford told me about it. That's why I came back.","Dead of Night"
"609",2924820,2928230,"It belonged to a man who's crippled and who accused his wife, just as you're now accusing me.","Dead of Night"
"610",2928820,2930430,"Peter, you must listen to me.","Dead of Night"
"611",2963200,2966020,"Peter. Peter, darling are you alright?","Dead of Night"
"612",2968120,2971330,"- I seem to have cut myself.- Sit down let me have a look at it.","Dead of Night"
"613",2973200,2974440,"Look at the mirror.","Dead of Night"
"614",2974780,2976400,"How did that happen?","Dead of Night"
"615",2977000,2978650,"Nevermind now, darling.","Dead of Night"
"616",2981160,2986480,"- But darling, we could get it mended.- No we can't. Look, it's old and worm eaten and rotten.","Dead of Night"
"617",2987440,2989400,"It should have been burned ages ago.","Dead of Night"
"618",2993500,2995300,"You poor darling!","Dead of Night"
"619",2995450,2999940,"Well, I think you could do with a drink after that...I know I could.","Dead of Night"
"620",3000260,3004950,"Mother, what did you do with that bottleof schnapps that I got for Dr van Straaten","Dead of Night"
"621",3005700,3007650,"It's in the cupboard in the hall.","Dead of Night"
"622",3009060,3011720,"Well, hows the great debunkergoing to debunk that?","Dead of Night"
"623",3012140,3017910,"Ever since Mr Craig arrived, you've been asking me toproduce scientific explanations like rabbits out of a hat.","Dead of Night"
"624",3018100,3022780,"I am not accustomed to solving complex problemswith the careless ease of your brains trust.","Dead of Night"
"625",3022850,3025040,"It sounds to me as though you are completely stumped this time.","Dead of Night"
"626",3025330,3027520,"Joan saw the room in the mirroras well as Peter.","Dead of Night"
"627",3028090,3029920,"The witness I couldn'tsupply you with.","Dead of Night"
"628",3030370,3032880,"Very well.You asked for it.","Dead of Night"
"629",3033950,3037300,"This was a case of crypto-amnesia.","Dead of Night"
"630",3037570,3042550,"The transmissabilty of an illusionby one person to one or more other persons","Dead of Night"
"631",3042650,3046430,"who are emotionally cohesive.is well established.","Dead of Night"
"632",3046570,3048320,"Do I make myself clear?","Dead of Night"
"633",3048390,3050200,"I'm certainly at sea.","Dead of Night"
"634",3050280,3054850,"You wouldn't like to start again would youvery slowly and in words of one syllable?","Dead of Night"
"635",3054910,3056200,"Hamlet was right, doctor.","Dead of Night"
"636",3057030,3060300,"There are more things in heaven and earththan are dreamed of in your philosophy.","Dead of Night"
"637",3060910,3064600,"And my recurring dream isn't justa meaningless trick of the mind.","Dead of Night"
"638",3064890,3066560,"It was sent to meas a warning.","Dead of Night"
"639",3066760,3069680,"A warning against the terror that'swaiting for me in this house.","Dead of Night"
"640",3070150,3073070,"Well, I'm like Grainger.I'm going to act on the warning.","Dead of Night"
"641",3073270,3075270,"I'm going to leave here, now,this instant.","Dead of Night"
"642",3075800,3079840,"Craig, if you go nowyou'll be making profound mistake.","Dead of Night"
"643",3079890,3082500,"You'll be delivering yourselfinto the hands of your obsession.","Dead of Night"
"644",3082650,3084700,"I beg you to stay,and see it through.","Dead of Night"
"645",3084890,3086820,"Whatever happens, if anything happens","Dead of Night"
"646",3087120,3090710,"the reality can't be possibly beas bad as your imagination has painted it.","Dead of Night"
"647",3090800,3091670,"Why not?","Dead of Night"
"648",3091820,3097000,"I tell you doctor, there's something horribleawaiting for me here, perhaps even death itself.","Dead of Night"
"649",3097180,3100650,"Craig. An hour ago,you asked me to help you.","Dead of Night"
"650",3100700,3103750,"I think I can, butonly if you want me to,","Dead of Night"
"651",3103900,3106510,"only if you do what I beg you to do.","Dead of Night"
"652",3106660,3111430,"While every minute brings the horror closer?No doctor, I'm not going to submit my will to yours.","Dead of Night"
"653",3111630,3114160,"I'm going to leave this place now,before it too late.","Dead of Night"
"654",3115360,3117950,"What's your tipple by the way?Scotch?","Dead of Night"
"655",3118000,3120400,"No thanks, I'm going.I can't face it.","Dead of Night"
"656",3120460,3123560,"Oh, I'm sorry my dear fellow,however, I don't blame you a bit.","Dead of Night"
"657",3123730,3127420,"Oh yes you do. You despise me.You think I'm a contemptible coward.","Dead of Night"
"658",3127870,3129730,"Nothing of the kind, honestly.","Dead of Night"
"659",3130050,3135340,"Still, I'm sorry because, well whatever's going to wind a fellow,I'd like to rally round, lend a helping hand and all that sort of rot.","Dead of Night"
"660",3135490,3137900,"- Nobody can help me.- Tell you what. Have one for the road.","Dead of Night"
"661",3137910,3141460,"- Well...- Matter of fact I know just how you feel.","Dead of Night"
"662",3141790,3144800,"Jolly unpleasant, when you comeslap up against the supernatural.","Dead of Night"
"663",3145290,3149800,"I still get a shiver when I think about what happenedto a couple of friends of mine. Ghastly business.","Dead of Night"
"664",3151220,3153930,"It was when I was staying atmy golf club at Wittlesham.","Dead of Night"
"665",3154900,3158010,"The stars at the club were George Parratt and Larry Potter.","Dead of Night"
"666",3158260,3160290,"Nothing could keep them from their game.","Dead of Night"
"667",3161260,3164170,"They were both pretty good and they weredeadly rivals, but only on the links.","Dead of Night"
"668",3164250,3167960,"In all other respects,they were the best of friends.","Dead of Night"
"669",3168900,3181220,"Until ... Mary","Dead of Night"
"670",3186910,3189250,"Mary seemed to look on themwith equal favour.","Dead of Night"
"671",3189300,3192820,"And the result, of course,was complete deadlock.","Dead of Night"
"672",3193210,3197000,"It can't go on like this, old man.She's ruining my game.","Dead of Night"
"673",3197050,3198260,"Mine too.","Dead of Night"
"674",3199030,3201590,"Every time I take a stroke,I see her wretched face.","Dead of Night"
"675",3201830,3205450,"I keep on hearing her tiresome voice,just as I'm swinging.","Dead of Night"
"676",3206710,3208750,"They'll be raising our handicaps soon.","Dead of Night"
"677",3210120,3211750,"She must choose one of us.","Dead of Night"
"678",3212080,3215620,"But there's nothing to choose.We're both as good as Bobby Jones.","Dead of Night"
"679",3217520,3218660,"Very nearly.","Dead of Night"
"680",3222420,3224030,"Wish you were dead, old man.","Dead of Night"
"681",3226420,3228030,"It'd be just as good, if you were.","Dead of Night"
"682",3230700,3233230,"- George, I've got it!- What?","Dead of Night"
"683",3233330,3235850,"- We'll play for her.- Tomorrow morning. 18 holes.","Dead of Night"
"684",3235900,3237860,"- Match play.- Loser to vanish from the scene.","Dead of Night"
"685",3237910,3239270,"- Forever.- Put it there, old man.","Dead of Night"
"686",3239320,3241680,"Of course, why didn't we thinkof it sooner.","Dead of Night"
"687",3243100,3246160,"It was a terrific game.They halved the first four holes.","Dead of Night"
"688",3246210,3248760,"Then Parratt sliced his driveand Potter took the lead.","Dead of Night"
"689",3249210,3252320,"But at the long thirteenth,Parratt got a wonderful four...","Dead of Night"
"690",3252740,3257800,"and after that, it was ding dong all the way.Parratt Potter. Potter Parratt","Dead of Night"
"691",3258070,3260470,"When they reached the last hole,they were square once more.","Dead of Night"
"692",3260730,3263030,"This hole for Mary Lee ...","Dead of Night"
"693",3276260,3278550,"- How many, old man?- Three.","Dead of Night"
"694",3278600,3280050,"- And you?- Two.","Dead of Night"
"695",3281300,3282170,"Two?!","Dead of Night"
"696",3282700,3286810,"Yes. Didn't you see my spoon shot?Beautiful shot, wasn't it Smithers?","Dead of Night"
"697",3287060,3288040,"Oh, a lovely shot sir.","Dead of Night"
"698",3288860,3293530,"Nobody's ever reached this green in 2 before.I don't believe it's possible.","Dead of Night"
"699",3294380,3300010,"- There it is. No mistake is there, Smithers?- No sir. Quite right, sir. Only 2 strokes.","Dead of Night"
"700",3301300,3304500,"Mm. Seems as if I've got my workcut out then.","Dead of Night"
"701",3314600,3317060,"Ho ho. Jolly good putt old man.","Dead of Night"
"702",3317870,3320100,"Well, here's for it...","Dead of Night"
"703",3325630,3326820,"Well, that's that!","Dead of Night"
"704",3330010,3331400,"Grand finish and grand game.","Dead of Night"
"705",3331900,3333630,"An almost incredible finish.","Dead of Night"
"706",3408140,3413650,"With Mary in the bag, Parratt realised it wastime to turn his mind once more to serious things.","Dead of Night"
"707",3414220,3418700,"He hadn't touched his clubs since thePotter tragedy and he needed practice.","Dead of Night"
"708",3419030,3424500,"I offered to give him a game. I soon found to mycost he was playing better than ever.","Dead of Night"
"709",3424750,3426820,"My bobs seemed very good to him.","Dead of Night"
"710",3427490,3430500,"And then we reached the lake","Dead of Night"
"711",3432930,3434670,"Good morning, George old man.","Dead of Night"
"712",3437610,3438940,"Still cheating?","Dead of Night"
"713",3443010,3445590,"Oh yes, it's me alright.","Dead of Night"
"714",3447100,3448990,"I've returned from my watery grave.","Dead of Night"
"715",3449230,3452180,"... to haunt you.","Dead of Night"
"716",3458780,3462130,"Cheat! Cad! Twister!","Dead of Night"
"717",3462360,3464640,"Worm! Skunk! Rat!","Dead of Night"
"718",3465550,3467030,"Rabbit!","Dead of Night"
"719",3468320,3473190,"Ho ho ho. Oh, I'll teach youthat crime doesn't pay.","Dead of Night"
"720",3473840,3476430,"Unconditional surrender, old man.","Dead of Night"
"721",3477100,3482310,"Those are my terms.May the Lord have mercy on your handicap.","Dead of Night"
"722",3500050,3502120,"- I say, Eliot...- Yes, old man?","Dead of Night"
"723",3503870,3506960,"- Do you believe in ghosts?- Ghosts?","Dead of Night"
"724",3508370,3509370,"Good Lord, no.","Dead of Night"
"725",3510450,3511370,"Neither do I.","Dead of Night"
"726",3556190,3558190,"That was only the beginning.","Dead of Night"
"727",3571550,3576690,"For this poor stricken shadow of a manthere was only one living.","Dead of Night"
"728",3576930,3579280,"Another whiskey Fred.A large one.","Dead of Night"
"729",3579330,3580360,"Make it two.","Dead of Night"
"730",3582570,3584590,"Heavens! I thought you were dead.","Dead of Night"
"731",3584650,3587370,"So I am old man,as dead as a stymie.","Dead of Night"
"732",3587610,3588410,"Two large whiskeys, Fred.","Dead of Night"
"733",3588650,3589610,"You mean a quadruple, sir?","Dead of Night"
"734",3589660,3593600,"No no no. Separate glasses of course.One for him.","Dead of Night"
"735",3595200,3600150,"Fred can't see me or hear me. Nobody elsecan either. It's only you I'm haunting.","Dead of Night"
"736",3600200,3603410,"Well, it's time you gave somebody else a turn. I've had it.","Dead of Night"
"737",3603490,3607840,"Not bad, am I, for a beginner.George Parratt, handicap 18!","Dead of Night"
"738",3607900,3611050,"- I think it's perfectly despicable.- Not nearly despicable as cheating at golf.","Dead of Night"
"739",3611100,3613060,"- You haven't a vestige of proof- Yes I have. It's on the record.","Dead of Night"
"740",3613110,3616690,"- What record?  - The recording angel's record.It shows there you took 5 for the 18th.","Dead of Night"
"741",3616880,3618210,"5 shillings please sir.","Dead of Night"
"742",3618700,3620930,"Recording angel!It can't count.","Dead of Night"
"743",3624460,3627090,"Listen now, you're going too far,to start all that on the link.","Dead of Night"
"744",3627340,3631150,"You don't expect me to stop there, old man.All the stuff, I did, was very elementary.","Dead of Night"
"745",3631200,3633890,"Any rabbit could do it.A ghost must better himself.","Dead of Night"
"746",3633940,3636750,"You mean to say, you're going to hang around me for the rest of my life?","Dead of Night"
"747",3636800,3639250,"I most certainly am. Unless of course,you try to lay me.","Dead of Night"
"748",3639300,3642450,"- How?  - Well, first of all,you must give up Mary.","Dead of Night"
"749",3642510,3645910,"Give up Mary?Certainly not!","Dead of Night"
"750",3646000,3649400,"I'm not going to have a fine younggirl like that married to a cheat and a liar.","Dead of Night"
"751",3649930,3653990,"I suppose I've got it coming to me.It would break my heart of course.","Dead of Night"
"752",3654230,3658130,"Listen, if you promise to let me alone,I'll step out of Mary's life.","Dead of Night"
"753",3658180,3661390,"Well, that's my first condition.The second is...","Dead of Night"
"754",3663400,3665130,"- You'll have to give up golf.- Give up golf!?","Dead of Night"
"755",3670960,3671680,"Never.","Dead of Night"
"756",3671900,3675230,"Don't you realise what you've done?You've disgraced this club.","Dead of Night"
"757",3675380,3677480,"besmirched the greatest of all games","Dead of Night"
"758",3677620,3679570,"dragged the name of St Andrew in the dust.","Dead of Night"
"759",3679650,3682250,"Good heavens man, you should bedrummed out of the Royal and Ancient.","Dead of Night"
"760",3682300,3685850,"Oh yes yes yes, I admit all of this.I'm a cad, a rat and a worm.","Dead of Night"
"761",3685900,3689280,"I agree with everything you've called me.But you can't punish me like this.","Dead of Night"
"762",3689500,3692650,"Listen Larry, you're golfer yourself.","Dead of Night"
"763",3692700,3698030,"You must realise what it means.I should have nothing left to live for. Nothing.","Dead of Night"
"764",3698280,3699640,"You can't be such an accountant.","Dead of Night"
"765",3701200,3702850,"Perhaps, you're right old man","Dead of Night"
"766",3703160,3707950,"- I mustn't lower myself to your level.- Dear old Larry. I knew you'd see it the right way.","Dead of Night"
"767",3708000,3711160,"- But you've got to break with Mary.- And if I do, you'll never haunt me again?","Dead of Night"
"768",3711210,3713300,"I'll disappear here and now, forever.","Dead of Night"
"769",3713370,3715000,"Ah, it's a deal.","Dead of Night"
"770",3716500,3717470,"One for the sky.","Dead of Night"
"771",3717510,3719900,"No thanks, I've got a date with St Andrewat 4 o'clock.","Dead of Night"
"772",3719950,3722260,"Oh goodbye, old boy. Good luck.Hope you win.","Dead of Night"
"773",3722310,3724240,"Thanks George. Goodbye.","Dead of Night"
"774",3733860,3735020,"What's the matter?","Dead of Night"
"775",3735260,3738540,"My powers have gone.I'd better try again.","Dead of Night"
"776",3753750,3758420,"George, I've forgotten how to vanish.","Dead of Night"
"777",3758980,3762300,"Look here, old man.That's shocking.","Dead of Night"
"778",3762350,3765640,"I can get as far as this,then I can't remember what I do next.","Dead of Night"
"779",3765690,3768350,"You must remember. Don't forgetyou've been well and truly laid.","Dead of Night"
"780",3768400,3770700,"I know I've got to hold my breathand do this...","Dead of Night"
"781",3773770,3774980,"But then I get stuck.","Dead of Night"
"782",3775350,3776750,"Well, what about that.","Dead of Night"
"783",3778830,3780750,"No good? Well, try this.","Dead of Night"
"784",3791480,3794080,"No good. No good.Oh I am sorry.","Dead of Night"
"785",3794130,3798580,"But give us a kick. I mean, a ghost shouldn't be allowedto go haunting until he's properly qualified.","Dead of Night"
"786",3798630,3802200,"It's all my fault, I'm afraid. I shouldhave spent longer on the materialisation course...","Dead of Night"
"787",3802250,3804540,"but you would insiston getting married on Saturday.","Dead of Night"
"788",3804590,3807230,"- I still intend to get married on Saturday.- Oh but you promised.","Dead of Night"
"789",3807280,3810470,"You can't keep your side of the bargain.Why should you expect me to keep mine?","Dead of Night"
"790",3810520,3813000,"- I see your point. You realise what it will mean though?- What?","Dead of Night"
"791",3813600,3816500,"- Well, I shall have to stick to you, everywhere.","Dead of Night"
"792",3816600,3817650,"Everywhere?","Dead of Night"
"793",3817700,3822020,"Yes. Always remain within 6 foot of you.That's the official ruling.","Dead of Night"
"794",3822700,3827980,"Because, a chap becomes a ghost, it surelydoesn't mean that he ceases to be a gentleman.","Dead of Night"
"795",3828030,3831760,"Don't worry, old chap,it's sure to come back to me before Saturday.","Dead of Night"

"802",3888850,3891650,"Now this one here's a long story.","Dead of Night"
"803",3891700,3894600,"Darling, you can tell me allabout that tomorrow.","Dead of Night"
"804",3895360,3896720,"Kiss me.","Dead of Night"

"808",3910200,3913080,"Get on with it. Get on with it, you mug.That's what you're here for.","Dead of Night"
"809",3913600,3916200,"Well, we're not busy now.","Dead of Night"
"810",3932000,3933810,"Gracious, ten already!","Dead of Night"
"811",3934670,3937490,"Is it darling, I didn't count!","Dead of Night"
"812",3937540,3939790,"Well, I think I'll be turning in, then.","Dead of Night"
"813",3940700,3942700,"Yes, I think I'll turn in too.","Dead of Night"
"814",3942760,3944450,"I'm really rather tired.","Dead of Night"
"815",3946180,3947250,"So am I.","Dead of Night"
"816",3954200,3955770,"- Six feet, old man!- Six feet","Dead of Night"
"817",3958260,3961270,"I don't wonder ...I'll just go and count the cups.","Dead of Night"
"818",3961320,3964780,"- Count the cups?  - Yes, I'll count the cups. I always count the cups before I go to bed.","Dead of Night"
"819",3966240,3967810,"Really, this is intolerable.","Dead of Night"
"820",3968000,3971250,"Yes, I quite agree,but what can I do everything's failed?","Dead of Night"
"821",3971300,3973890,"Have another go.Try as you've never tried before.","Dead of Night"
"822",3973940,3975770,"Alright, for what it's worth","Dead of Night"
"823",3975820,3978360,"Shut your eyes ...help you to concentrate.","Dead of Night"
"824",3978410,3979940,"OK, here goes.","Dead of Night"
"825",3986400,3991750,"- Ohh, of all the dirty tricks. I can't think what's come over you.- It's entirely your fault. You can't cheat a ghost.","Dead of Night"
"826",3991800,3993520,"What the devil are we going to do now?","Dead of Night"
"827",3994280,3996400,"I shall have to go on trying.That's all.","Dead of Night"
"828",3996460,4001400,"Don't you see, you blithering idiot. There may be millionsof other combinations, and all you can do is this.","Dead of Night"
"829",4001450,4002980,"What comes next? Oh!","Dead of Night"
"830",4004030,4006000,"What are we going to do?What are we going to do?","Dead of Night"
"831",4017050,4018440,"But he's gone?","Dead of Night"
"832",4019800,4021120,"And I wasn't looking.","Dead of Night"
"833",4023060,4024270,"What's going to happen now?","Dead of Night"
"834",4024750,4035370,"- Darling. Oh, darling.- Do I make parsnips?","Dead of Night"
"835",4038800,4040250,"Or do I make muffins?","Dead of Night"
"836",4047800,4052200,"Really Eliot, that story is totally incredible and decidedly improper.","Dead of Night"
"837",4052250,4055300,"Sorry. I had to tell it.I couldn't bear to be left out in the cold.","Dead of Night"
"838",4055350,4058980,"That wasn't why you told the story.You did it to try and help me, didn't you?","Dead of Night"
"839",4059020,4062700,"You succeeded, where I failed Eliot.And in a double sense.","Dead of Night"
"840",4062750,4068850,"Craig, you said that the horror started when Eliottold about the death of a man, you'd never heard of.","Dead of Night"
"841",4068900,4070450,"- Didn't you?- That's right.","Dead of Night"
"842",4070500,4075660,"Well, Eliot just described how his friendPotter committed suicide.","Dead of Night"
"843",4075710,4080130,"- You'd never heard of Potter before, had you?- No. No, I hadn't.","Dead of Night"
"844",4080270,4082510,"Yet the horror hasn't started, has it?","Dead of Night"
"845",4083000,4085950,"- No, it hasn't.- There you are, you see.","Dead of Night"
"846",4086100,4088970,"I'm so glad.The spell has been broken at last.","Dead of Night"
"847",4089020,4091540,"Now, I can go and see about dinner with an easy mind.","Dead of Night"
"848",4091970,4095800,"- I'll lend a hand, if I may?- Oh, thank you my dear. That's very kind of you.","Dead of Night"
"849",4095850,4101800,"Oh, Mr Craig, now that you've met usI'm sure you wouldn't dream of dreaming about us again.","Dead of Night"
"850",4101850,4103110,"Come along, my dear.","Dead of Night"
"851",4104380,4109850,"Apart from my bit of nonsense, the curious thing is that all of you,even Sally, seems to have had one of these extraordinary experiences.","Dead of Night"
"852",4109900,4112980,"Well, perhaps, they aren't so extraordinary.Perhaps they happen to most people.","Dead of Night"
"853",4113030,4116810,"Oh you mean there's a ghost as well asa skeleton in everyone's cupboard.","Dead of Night"
"854",4116860,4117950,"That's a pretty thought.","Dead of Night"
"855",4118000,4119550,"What's the ghost in your cupboard, doctor?","Dead of Night"
"856",4120200,4128410,"Well, there was one occasion in my professional careerthat made me wonder.","Dead of Night"
"857",4128680,4131050,"Made me wonder quite a lot.","Dead of Night"
"858",4131150,4132700,"You may remember the case.","Dead of Night"
"859",4132750,4136300,"Maxwell Frere, the ventriloquistwas charged with the attempted murder","Dead of Night"
"860",4136350,4141150,"of a man in the same line of business,Sylvester Kee, an American.","Dead of Night"
"861",4141200,4147090,"My friend Maurice Olcott, who was defending the case,wanted my opinion on the state of his mind.","Dead of Night"
"862",4148800,4151800,"Hello Frere,this is Dr Van Straaten.","Dead of Night"
"863",4153900,4155500,"He's going to help uswith the case.","Dead of Night"
"864",4156000,4160370,"How do you do, Mr Frere. I had the pleasure of seeingyour performance last year at the Haye. It was most...","Dead of Night"
"865",4160620,4163850,"Doctor eh?A brain specialist?","Dead of Night"
"866",4163900,4165200,"Psychiatrist.","Dead of Night"
"867",4165800,4166800,"I thought as much.","Dead of Night"
"868",4168050,4170100,"You want to psychoanalyse me, don't you?","Dead of Night"
"869",4170150,4172650,"Want to look inside my brain and seehow the wheels turn around.","Dead of Night"
"870",4172700,4174030,"Now wait a moment Frere...","Dead of Night"
"871",4174080,4175600,"Dissect me like a guinea pig,","Dead of Night"
"872",4176000,4179660,"Then show me off to you distinguished colleaguesas an interesting case.","Dead of Night"
"873",4179850,4181100,"Well, that's it, isn't it?","Dead of Night"
"874",4181250,4186350,"Hardly, but it's possible that I may be ableto help you if you are prepared to help me.","Dead of Night"
"875",4186500,4189010,"Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions.","Dead of Night"
"876",4190600,4194720,"You're wasting your time, doctor.I'm not mad.","Dead of Night"
"877",4195640,4197900,"I don't want your help.Nor yours either.","Dead of Night"
"878",4198300,4199950,"Hugo's the only one who can help me.","Dead of Night"
"879",4200000,4203100,"- The dummy?- Yes, the police are holding it as evidence.","Dead of Night"
"880",4203920,4207630,"Hugo should be here with me.You see...","Dead of Night"
"881",4209230,4213300,"- He's more to blame for all this, than I am.- What exactly do you mean by that?","Dead of Night"
"882",4214180,4218200,"You'd like to know, wouldn't you?Well get Hugo back and perhaps you will.","Dead of Night"
"883",4218750,4224230,"Perhaps, you'll have a case sure to make your complexes stand on end.And you can write a big fat book all about it, eh?","Dead of Night"
"884",4225800,4227250,"Does that tempt you, doctor?","Dead of Night"
"885",4230500,4232700,"Very well then, get Hugo back.","Dead of Night"
"886",4234110,4236110,"Now you see what I'm up against?","Dead of Night"
"887",4237100,4238550,"Very interesting.","Dead of Night"
"888",4239100,4244800,"- I'd like to have a talk with that other fellow, Kee.- I'm afraid that's out of the question. He's a witness for the prosecution.","Dead of Night"
"889",4245000,4247500,"Have a look at his statement.I'd like to know what you think of it.","Dead of Night"
"890",4247550,4249800,"Seems more like your job than mine.","Dead of Night"
"891",4252620,4254700,"I knew Maxwell Frere by reputation","Dead of Night"
"892",4254750,4259320,"as an artiste of the highest standingin his and my profession.","Dead of Night"
"893",4261100,4263450,"I first made his acquaintanceabout a year ago when","Dead of Night"

"902",4290650,4294450,"Say Beulah, this guy Frere,they tell me he's pretty good.","Dead of Night"
"903",4294500,4297450,"- I'll say he is.- What's he got that I haven't got?","Dead of Night"
"904",4297500,4299810,"His dummy.Don't say you haven't seen him?","Dead of Night"
"905",4299860,4302300,"Well, what are we waiting for.Come on, let's go in.","Dead of Night"
"906",4302350,4306150,"If we had to do this routine in the Coliseum,the act would be in ruins.","Dead of Night"
"907",4306200,4311150,"Coliseum,? Ruins?I kill myself sometimes.","Dead of Night"
"908",4312300,4314300,"Not this one. Not this one.","Dead of Night"

"915",4338900,4340810,"Oh, the lady's face is familiar, is it.","Dead of Night"
"916",4340950,4344340,"What would I be doing in the Folies Berg�reslooking at faces?","Dead of Night"

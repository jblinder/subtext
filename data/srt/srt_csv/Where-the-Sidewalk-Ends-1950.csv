"570",2596480,2598277,"He had a silver plate in his head","Where the Sidewalk Ends"

"572",2601720,2603790,"I buy that, Lieutenant.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"573",2603880,2607270,"The killer tried to get the body out,but he was surprised by someone,","Where the Sidewalk Ends"

"575",2611000,2613878,"He ducked behindthe staircase here, and hid the body.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"576",2613960,2616872,"That's the reasonfor the bloodstain on the wall.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"577",2616960,2620669,"- If it is Paine's blood.- We'll get the lab report shortly.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"578",2620760,2623638,"Now, we can establishthe time of the killing","Where the Sidewalk Ends"

"587",2651160,2652513,"That's right.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"588",2652600,2656275,"Paine came, packed and left at 1.10.That's when the taxi picked him up.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"589",2656360,2658920,"You must've practicallypassed each other.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"590",2659000,2661833,"Well, he wasn't here,so I thought he might be drinking.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"591",2661920,2663592,"I had a look in a couple of bars.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"592",2663680,2667116,"It's queer to figure a guy on the lamis going to be sitting around bars.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"593",2667200,2669839,"- What time did Dixon come back?- About 1.50.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"594",2669920,2673151,"- And you left right after that?- Right. We started chasing Paine.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"595",2673240,2677756,"It's obvious. He lays a fake trail.He goes to the Pennsylvania Station,","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"596",2677840,2680673,"and then he decides to come backand hide out in his own apartment.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"597",2680760,2683991,"He figures the police have been thereand they won't come looking again.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"598",2684080,2686799,"What time did Jiggs Taylorsay he was here?","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"599",2686880,2690031,"- About 2.15.- That pretty well fingers him.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"600",2690120,2692634,"Yeah, and he came down crazy angry,according to his daughter,","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"601",2692720,2695917,"- ready to knock Paine's block off.- You're wasting your time on Taylor.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"602",2696000,2699629,"How's that? It looks completelydefinite: Motive, opportunity.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"

"665",2882760,2884716,"Seems we're on the wrong man,Lieutenant,","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"666",2884800,2886916,"especially if the congressmanbacks him up.","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"667",2887000,2890117,"It's not the wrong man.If Paine was already dead at 2.15","Where the Sidewalk Ends"
"668",2890200,2894352,"and Taylor got the body at that time,stuck it in the back of his car...","Where the Sidewalk Ends"

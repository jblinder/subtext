"136",1598530,1600828,"I locked her door and went home.","Killer's Kiss"
"137",1600932,1604595,"But first thing in the morning,I went back across to see how she was.","Killer's Kiss"
"138",1604702,1605828,"My knocking woke her up,","Killer's Kiss"
"139",1605937,1609498,"but she was all smiles and yawnsand invited me in for breakfast.","Killer's Kiss"
"140",1609607,1612269,"Later over coffee,she told me she had seen the fight,","Killer's Kiss"
"141",1612377,1615141,"and I suppose that got me startedtalking about myself,","Killer's Kiss"
"142",1615246,1616975,"about what a wash-up I was,","Killer's Kiss"
"143",1617081,1620539,"how I was going back to Seattleand work on my uncle's horse ranch.","Killer's Kiss"
"144",1620652,1625316,"But when I think back about it now,I realize that all the time I was talking,","Killer's Kiss"
"145",1625423,1628483,"the thing that was really in my mindwas to remember not to ask","Killer's Kiss"
"146",1628593,1631687,"what it was her boss, Rappalo,was so sorry for.","Killer's Kiss"
"147",1631796,1634560,"Anyway, let's talk about you.","Killer's Kiss"
"148",1634666,1636099,"Like...","Killer's Kiss"
"149",1637302,1640066,"Who are those peoplein that picture over there?","Killer's Kiss"
"150",1640171,1642935,"And how'd you ever get messed upwith that dance hall guy?","Killer's Kiss"
"151",1643708,1644868,"What's the matter?","Killer's Kiss"
"152",1645810,1647107,"Nothing.","Killer's Kiss"
"153",1647211,1650806,"Just that it's so funnythat you should ask","Killer's Kiss"
"154",1650915,1653907,"those questions that way,together that way.","Killer's Kiss"
"155",1654018,1655315,"Why?","Killer's Kiss"
"156",1655420,1658947,"Well, they have both so muchto do with each other.","Killer's Kiss"
"157",1659057,1660046,"How do you mean?","Killer's Kiss"
"158",1660959,1663484,"It's sort of an involved story.Do you really want to hear it?","Killer's Kiss"
"159",1663595,1665790,"If you don't mind telling me,I would, very much.","Killer's Kiss"
"160",1665897,1667057,"I don't mind.","Killer's Kiss"
"161",1667165,1669258,"For some reason, I feel like telling you.","Killer's Kiss"
"162",1669367,1671392,"I've never told anybody before.","Killer's Kiss"
"163",1677041,1681068,"This is my father,and this is my sister Iris.","Killer's Kiss"
"164",1681179,1684615,"But I suppose it's really Iris' story.","Killer's Kiss"
"165",1684716,1688880,"She was a ballet dancer,and everyone said she was very good.","Killer's Kiss"
"166",1688987,1692753,"She adored Daddy,and of course, she was his favorite.","Killer's Kiss"
"167",1693625,1695957,"But let me startfrom the beginning.","Killer's Kiss"
"168",1696060,1698358,"Iris was eight years old.","Killer's Kiss"
"169",1698463,1701694,"Father was a writerwith a growing reputation,","Killer's Kiss"
"170",1701799,1704893,"and Mother was very beautifuland very intelligent.","Killer's Kiss"
"171",1705003,1708302,"They loved each other very much,and they were very happy.","Killer's Kiss"
"172",1709474,1712773,"Then I was born,and my mother died on the same day.","Killer's Kiss"
"173",1713544,1717310,"They say Father went on a two-weekdrunk to celebrate the double event.","Killer's Kiss"
"174",1717415,1720976,"And after that, I don't thinkhe ever thought of another woman.","Killer's Kiss"
"175",1722286,1725687,"Time passed, and Iris grewmore beautiful each day.","Killer's Kiss"
"176",1726357,1728291,"She was the image of her mother.","Killer's Kiss"
"177",1728393,1730361,"Everyone said so.","Killer's Kiss"
"178",1730461,1734522,"Iris was Daddy's favorite,and I was very jealous.","Killer's Kiss"
"179",1734632,1737226,"And maybe I began to hate her.","Killer's Kiss"
"180",1738169,1741366,"Daddy was good to meand maybe he loved me a little, too.","Killer's Kiss"
"181",1741472,1744999,"By the time she was 20,she was dancing with the Ballet Russe,","Killer's Kiss"
"182",1745109,1747236,"and Daddy was so proud of her.","Killer's Kiss"
"183",1747945,1750209,"And then I remember the day clearly.","Killer's Kiss"
"184",1750314,1754273,"It was my 13th birthday,Sunday afternoon.","Killer's Kiss"
"185",1754385,1758446,"Iris came home excitedand told us of her marriage proposal.","Killer's Kiss"
"186",1758556,1763357,"The man wasn't bad-looking...in his early 30s and very rich.","Killer's Kiss"
"187",1763461,1765554,"Father knew him and liked him,","Killer's Kiss"
"188",1765663,1769258,"but he couldn't stop laughingwhen Iris told how she said no","Killer's Kiss"
"189",1769367,1772097,"simply because the fella wanted herto give up her dancing","Killer's Kiss"
"190",1772203,1773898,"and just be his wife.","Killer's Kiss"
"191",1774572,1777268,"She never saidif she loved him or not.","Killer's Kiss"
"192",1778142,1782704,"Then a few months later,Daddy took sick and didn't get better.","Killer's Kiss"
"193",1783448,1785473,"And it turned outthat he never would","Killer's Kiss"
"194",1785583,1789041,"and that he would needconstant medical care until the end.","Killer's Kiss"
"195",1789153,1791883,"""Six months to two years,"" they said.","Killer's Kiss"
"196",1793958,1796483,"Iris' salary wasn't enough,","Killer's Kiss"
"197",1796594,1799688,"and in two months' time,all our savings were gone.","Killer's Kiss"
"198",1800598,1805035,"I couldn't work.I was only 13 and still in grade school.","Killer's Kiss"
"199",1806304,1809000,"The next thing I knew,she married her rich suitor,","Killer's Kiss"
"200",1809107,1813510,"and we were all living in great styleon his estate in Long Island.","Killer's Kiss"
"201",1814078,1816171,"Daddy had the best caremoney could buy,","Killer's Kiss"
"202",1816280,1819340,"and he seemed happydespite everything.","Killer's Kiss"
"203",1820151,1823211,"Iris gave up her dancingaccording to the marriage bargain","Killer's Kiss"
"204",1823321,1826518,"and did little elsebut sit at Daddy's bedside.","Killer's Kiss"
"205",1827425,1830917,"Sick as he was, he alwayslaughed a lot when they were together.","Killer's Kiss"
"206",1831662,1834460,"I guess I hated hermore than ever now.","Killer's Kiss"
"207",1838569,1840969,"A year passed like that.","Killer's Kiss"
"208",1841072,1845031,"Her husband was a sweet man, butnone of us paid much attention to him.","Killer's Kiss"
"209",1845743,1848712,"And by then, I'm sure he knewshe didn't love him,","Killer's Kiss"
"210",1848813,1851145,"but he never said anything.","Killer's Kiss"
"211",1851816,1853545,"Then one cold winter morning,","Killer's Kiss"

"213",1857288,1859119,"Iris was like a stone.","Killer's Kiss"

"215",1861459,1864724,"I began to cryand shout that I hated her...","Killer's Kiss"

"225",1892156,1895819,"She had cut her wrists,and she was dead.","Killer's Kiss"
"226",1896894,1898987,"She left me a note.","Killer's Kiss"
"227",1902266,1904063,"She said she loved me.","Killer's Kiss"
"228",1904168,1908298,"She was sorry for makinga mess of everything between us.","Killer's Kiss"
"229",1909207,1912233,"A few days later, I was in the cityattending to some legal things,","Killer's Kiss"

"234",1924555,1927115,"I don't understand any part of it.","Killer's Kiss"

"238",1941005,1943496,"And then I started to feelless unhappy.","Killer's Kiss"
"239",1946210,1947575,"Come on.Let's go out for a walk.","Killer's Kiss"
"240",1949113,1951547,"She got dressed,and we went out for a walk.","Killer's Kiss"

"242",1955286,1958847,"I suppose we must have walked forhours, and slowly her mood changed,","Killer's Kiss"
"243",1958956,1962289,"and she became very happyand optimistic about life in general.","Killer's Kiss"
"244",1962393,1963587,"But when I told her I was planning","Killer's Kiss"

"263",2067698,2070166,"and she was so scared,she'd grab at anything.","Killer's Kiss"
"264",2070267,2074135,"But I was kidding myself, and all I couldthink of was how much I wanted her.","Killer's Kiss"
"265",2074238,2075569,"We made train reservations","Killer's Kiss"
"266",2075673,2078335,"and wired Uncle Georgeto brace himself for a niece.","Killer's Kiss"

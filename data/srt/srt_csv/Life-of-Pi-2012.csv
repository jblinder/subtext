"691",5619363,5622992,"Can you feel the rain?","Life of Pi"
"692",5641511,5646390,"God, thank you for giving me my life.","Life of Pi"
"693",5648560,5650560,"I'm ready now.","Life of Pi"
"694",5681676,5683761,"Richard Parker?","Life of Pi"
"695",5732018,5733685,"Mmm.","Life of Pi"
"696",5782025,5784194,"Excuse me.","Life of Pi"
"697",5784945,5786654,"Move.","Life of Pi"
"698",5787364,5789867,"Move. Excuse me.","Life of Pi"
"699",5922125,5924458,"Hey! Hey!","Life of Pi"
"700",5925336,5926837,"Hey, come on!","Life of Pi"
"701",5929340,5930841,"Hey.","Life of Pi"
"702",5931842,5935261,"Hey, get away.This is my bed.","Life of Pi"
"703",6063474,6065891,"It was a human tooth?","Life of Pi"
"704",6066060,6069145,"Don't you see?The island was carnivorous.","Life of Pi"
"705",6069313,6072149,"Carnivorous?Like a Venus Flytrap?","Life of Pi"
"706",6072315,6075152,"Yes, the whole island.","Life of Pi"
"707",6075319,6079780,"The plants, the water in thosepools, the very ground itself.","Life of Pi"
"708",6080490,6083452,"During the day, thosepools held fresh water.","Life of Pi"
"709",6083618,6085746,"But at night, some chemical process","Life of Pi"
"710",6085829,6088832,"turned the waterin those pools into acid...","Life of Pi"
"711",6089792,6092002,"acid that dissolved those fish...","Life of Pi"
"712",6092170,6094671,"that sent the meerkatsscurrying into the trees,","Life of Pi"
"713",6094756,6096965,"and Richard Parkerrunning to the boat.","Life of Pi"
"714",6097132,6099134,"But where did the tooth come from?","Life of Pi"
"715",6099301,6102095,"Years ago, some poor fellow,just like me...","Life of Pi"
"716",6102262,6105015,"must have found himselfstranded on that island...","Life of Pi"
"717",6105182,6108518,"and, like me, thought hemight stay there forever.","Life of Pi"
"718",6108685,6113523,"But all that the island gave him byday, it took away again by night.","Life of Pi"
"719",6115025,6120197,"To think, how many hours spentwith only meerkats for company.","Life of Pi"
"720",6120363,6122783,"How much loneliness taken on.","Life of Pi"
"721",6123158,6125368,"All I know is that eventually he died","Life of Pi"
"722",6125453,6127453,"and the island digested him...","Life of Pi"
"723",6127622,6130372,"leaving behind only his teeth.","Life of Pi"
"724",6131708,6135170,"I saw how my life would endif I stayed on that island.","Life of Pi"
"725",6135337,6137046,"Alone and forgotten.","Life of Pi"
"726",6137881,6142551,"I had to get back to theworld, or die trying.","Life of Pi"
"727",6146390,6149184,"I spent the next daypreparing the boat.","Life of Pi"
"728",6149351,6151394,"I filled my stores with fresh water...","Life of Pi"
"729",6151645,6154230,"ate seaweed until my stomachcould take no more...","Life of Pi"
"730",6154398,6156733,"and brought as manymeerkats as I could fit","Life of Pi"
"731",6156818,6159903,"into the storage lockerfor Richard Parker.","Life of Pi"
"732",6161072,6163155,"I couldn't leavewithout him, of course.","Life of Pi"
"733",6163323,6165158,"It would mean killing him.","Life of Pi"
"734",6166911,6169871,"And so, I waited for his return.","Life of Pi"
"735",6171998,6173917,"I knew he wouldn't be late.","Life of Pi"
"736",6174085,6177587,"Richard Parker!","Life of Pi"
"737",6189934,6192435,"No one has seen thatfloating island since.","Life of Pi"
"738",6192603,6195896,"And you won't read about thosetrees in any nature book.","Life of Pi"
"739",6196064,6200109,"And yet, if I hadn't found thoseshores, I would have died.","Life of Pi"
"740",6200278,6202612,"If I hadn't discovered that tooth,","Life of Pi"
"741",6202697,6205782,"I would have been lost, alone forever.","Life of Pi"
"742",6205949,6208451,"Even when God seemedto have abandoned me...","Life of Pi"
"743",6208618,6210119,"He was watching.","Life of Pi"
"744",6210287,6213081,"Even when He seemed indifferentto my suffering...","Life of Pi"
"745",6213248,6214707,"He was watching.","Life of Pi"
"746",6214876,6218712,"And when I was beyond all hopeof saving, He gave me rest...","Life of Pi"
"747",6218880,6221965,"then gave me a signto continue my journey.","Life of Pi"
"748",6234811,6237354,"By the time we reachedthe Mexican shore,","Life of Pi"
"749",6237439,6240233,"I was afraid to let go of the boat.","Life of Pi"
"750",6240775,6244154,"My strength was gone.I was so weak.","Life of Pi"
"751",6244322,6248115,"I was afraid that in two feet ofwater, so close to deliverance...","Life of Pi"
"752",6248283,6250327,"I would drown.","Life of Pi"
"753",6259587,6263590,"I struggled to shoreand fell upon the sand.","Life of Pi"
"754",6263757,6265507,"It was warm and soft...","Life of Pi"
"755",6265676,6268970,"like pressing my faceagainst the cheek of God.","Life of Pi"
"756",6269846,6274350,"And somewhere, two eyes weresmiling at having me there.","Life of Pi"
"757",6278355,6282108,"I was so spent, I could hardly move.","Life of Pi"
"758",6288114,6291283,"And so, Richard Parkerwent ahead of me.","Life of Pi"
"759",6292662,6296706,"He stretched his legsand walked along the shore.","Life of Pi"
"760",6300461,6303712,"At the edge of the jungle, he stopped.","Life of Pi"
"761",6303881,6306341,"I was certain he was goingto look back at me...","Life of Pi"
"762",6306634,6309719,"flatten his ears to his head, growl.","Life of Pi"
"763",6309886,6313974,"That he would bring ourrelationship to an end in some way.","Life of Pi"
"764",6315893,6319061,"But he just stared aheadinto the jungle.","Life of Pi"
"765",6322649,6325234,"And then, Richard Parker,my fierce companion...","Life of Pi"
"766",6325403,6328070,"the terrible one who kept me alive...","Life of Pi"
"767",6330865,6334493,"disappeared forever from my life.","Life of Pi"
"768",6340501,6344003,"After a few hours, a memberof my own species found me.","Life of Pi"
"769",6344505,6347590,"He left and returned with agroup who carried me away.","Life of Pi"
"770",6349760,6352052,"I wept like a child.","Life of Pi"
"771",6352220,6356557,"Not because I was overwhelmed athaving survived, although I was.","Life of Pi"
"772",6357435,6363605,"I was weeping because RichardParker left me so unceremoniously.","Life of Pi"
"773",6365067,6367609,"It broke my heart.","Life of Pi"
"774",6373074,6375952,"You know, my father was right.","Life of Pi"
"775",6376119,6378872,"Richard Parker neversaw me as his friend.","Life of Pi"
"776",6379457,6383376,"After all we had been through,he didn't even look back.","Life of Pi"
"777",6384545,6386421,"But I have to believe therewas more in his eyes...","Life of Pi"
"778",6386588,6389591,"than my own reflectionstaring back at me.","Life of Pi"
"779",6389759,6392051,"I know it.I felt it.","Life of Pi"
"780",6392927,6395137,"Even if I can't prove it.","Life of Pi"
"781",6400435,6401935,"You know, I've left so much behind.","Life of Pi"
"782",6402104,6405481,"My family, the zoo, India, Anandi.","Life of Pi"
"783",6405815,6409903,"I suppose, in the end, the whole oflife becomes an act of letting go.","Life of Pi"
"784",6410654,6413489,"But what always hurts the most...","Life of Pi"
"785",6413657,6417284,"is not taking a moment to say goodbye.","Life of Pi"
"786",6418996,6423166,"I was never able to thank myfather for all I learned from him.","Life of Pi"
"787",6423333,6426336,"To tell him, without his lessons...","Life of Pi"
"788",6426921,6429171,"I would never have survived.","Life of Pi"
"789",6431300,6434969,"I know Richard Parker is a tiger,but I wish I had said...","Life of Pi"

"794",6455698,6458033,"I don't know what to say.","Life of Pi"
"795",6464375,6466960,"It's hard to believe, isn't it?","Life of Pi"
"796",6469963,6472172,"It is a lot to take in.","Life of Pi"
"797",6472550,6475301,"To figure out what it all means.","Life of Pi"
"798",6475469,6476636,"If it happened, it happened.","Life of Pi"
"799",6476720,6479305,"Why should it have to mean anything?","Life of Pi"
"800",6480850,6483810,"Some of it is pretty incredible.","Life of Pi"
"801",6483978,6486311,"See, I was the only onewho survived the shipwreck.","Life of Pi"
"802",6486896,6490065,"So the Japanese shipping companysent two men to talk to me...","Life of Pi"
"803",6490234,6493069,"in the Mexican hospitalwhere I was recovering.","Life of Pi"
"804",6495155,6497073,"I still have a copy of their report.","Life of Pi"
"805",6499243,6502328,"They had insurance claims to settle...","Life of Pi"
"806",6502496,6505414,"and they wanted to find outwhy the ship sank.","Life of Pi"
"807",6506417,6507876,"They didn't believe me, either.","Life of Pi"
"808",6511171,6514841,"Thousands of meerkats on afloating carnivorous island...","Life of Pi"
"809",6515009,6516926,"and no one has ever seen it?","Life of Pi"
"810",6517094,6519887,"Yes, just like I told you.","Life of Pi"
"811",6520055,6521764,"Bananas don't float.","Life of Pi"
"812",6521931,6523432,"Why are you talking about bananas?","Life of Pi"
"813",6523600,6526269,"You said the orangutan floatedto you on a bundle of bananas.","Life of Pi"
"814",6526436,6528270,"But bananas don't float.","Life of Pi"
"815",6528439,6529771,"Are you sure about that?","Life of Pi"
"816",6529939,6532442,"Of course they do.Try it for yourself.","Life of Pi"
"817",6533402,6537572,"In any case, we are not here totalk about bananas or meerkats.","Life of Pi"
"818",6537739,6541074,"Look, I've just told you along story and I'm very tired.","Life of Pi"
"819",6541243,6546122,"We are here because a Japanesecargo ship sank in the Pacific.","Life of Pi"
"820",6546289,6548750,"Something I never forget.","Life of Pi"
"821",6549918,6552377,"I lost my whole family.","Life of Pi"
"822",6557134,6558801,"Get him some water.","Life of Pi"
"823",6561262,6563472,"We don't mean to push you.","Life of Pi"
"824",6564557,6567435,"And you have our deepest sympathies.","Life of Pi"
"825",6567603,6569604,"But we have come a long way...","Life of Pi"
"826",6569771,6572940,"and we are no closer tounderstanding why the ship sank.","Life of Pi"
"827",6573108,6575234,"Because I don't know.","Life of Pi"
"828",6575402,6576944,"I was asleep.Something woke me up.","Life of Pi"
"829",6577112,6579655,"It could have been anexplosion, I can't be sure.","Life of Pi"
"830",6579823,6581740,"And then the ship sank.","Life of Pi"
"831",6582283,6583952,"What else do you want from me?","Life of Pi"
"832",6584118,6586412,"A story that won't make uslook like fools.","Life of Pi"
"833",6586579,6589582,"We need a simpler storyfor our report.","Life of Pi"
"834",6589750,6591917,"One our company can understand.","Life of Pi"
"835",6592168,6594671,"A story we can all believe.","Life of Pi"
"836",6597507,6600510,"So, a story without thingsyou've never seen before.","Life of Pi"
"837",6601011,6602345,"That's right.","Life of Pi"
"838",6602512,6606682,"Without surprises.Without animals or islands.","Life of Pi"
"839",6606850,6609519,"Yes. The truth.","Life of Pi"
"840",6618069,6620863,"So, what did you do?","Life of Pi"
"841",6625034,6627369,"I told them another story.","Life of Pi"
"842",6628204,6629372,"Four of us survived.","Life of Pi"
"843",6630248,6632792,"The cook and the sailorwere already aboard.","Life of Pi"
"844",6633085,6634918,"The cook threw me a lifebuoyand pulled me aboard...","Life of Pi"
"845",6635087,6638631,"and Mother held on to some bananasand made it to the Lifeboat.","Life of Pi"
"846",6640216,6643219,"The cook was a disgusting man.","Life of Pi"
"847",6643386,6645595,"He ate a rat.","Life of Pi"
"848",6645764,6648890,"We had food enough for weeks, but hefound the rat in the first few days...","Life of Pi"
"849",6649059,6652729,"and he killed it, driedit in the sun and ate it.","Life of Pi"
"850",6652895,6655105,"He was such a brute, that man.","Life of Pi"
"851",6656899,6659234,"But he was resourceful.","Life of Pi"
"852",6659944,6663573,"It was his idea to buildthe raft to catch fish.","Life of Pi"
"853",6663740,6666951,"We would have died in thosefirst few days without him.","Life of Pi"
"854",6669246,6673750,"The sailor was the same man whobrought rice and gravy, the Buddhist.","Life of Pi"
"855",6673917,6677295,"We didn't understand much of what hesaid, only that he was suffering.","Life of Pi"
"856",6677755,6679921,"He had broken his leghorribly in the fall.","Life of Pi"
"857",6680090,6683176,"We tried to set it as best we could,but the leg became infected...","Life of Pi"
"858",6683594,6688096,"and the cook said that we hadto do something or he'd die.","Life of Pi"
"859",6688599,6689640,"The cook said he'd do it,","Life of Pi"
"860",6689766,6692100,"but Mother and I hadto hold the man down.","Life of Pi"
"861",6692185,6694770,"And I believed him,we needed to do it.","Life of Pi"
"862",6695439,6697273,"So...","Life of Pi"
"863",6698942,6702028,"I kept saying,""I'm sorry, I'm sorry.""","Life of Pi"
"864",6702195,6706032,"And he just kept looking at me.His eyes were so...","Life of Pi"
"865",6709203,6712662,"I'll never understand the pointof that man's suffering.","Life of Pi"
"866",6713832,6716042,"I can still hear him.","Life of Pi"
"867",6716793,6720462,"The happy Buddhist,he only ate rice and gravy.","Life of Pi"
"868",6725676,6727720,"We didn't save him, of course.","Life of Pi"
"869",6727887,6729305,"He died.","Life of Pi"
"870",6730390,6732475,"The morning after, the cookcaught his first dorado...","Life of Pi"
"871",6732643,6735685,"and I didn't understand what he haddone at first, but Mother did...","Life of Pi"
"872",6735854,6738814,"and I had never seen Mother so angry.","Life of Pi"
"873",6739649,6741567,"""Stop whining and be happy,"" he said.","Life of Pi"
"874",6741734,6744569,"""We need more food or we'll die.That was the whole point.""","Life of Pi"
"875",6744738,6746655,"""What was the whole point?""Mother asked.","Life of Pi"
"876",6746823,6750909,"""You let that poor boy die inorder to get bait, you monster!""","Life of Pi"
"877",6752412,6753578,"The cook got furious.","Life of Pi"
"878",6753663,6755664,"He started towards herwith his fist raised...","Life of Pi"
"879",6755832,6758876,"and Mother slapped him hard,right across the face.","Life of Pi"
"880",6759043,6760920,"I was stunned.","Life of Pi"
"881",6761087,6763547,"I thought he was goingto kill her right then.","Life of Pi"
"882",6764882,6766759,"But he didn't.","Life of Pi"
"883",6768679,6771389,"The cook didn't stopat bait either, no.","Life of Pi"
"884",6772599,6774182,"The sailor...","Life of Pi"
"885",6775935,6778270,"He went the same way the rat went.","Life of Pi"
"886",6781024,6783525,"The cook was a resourceful man.","Life of Pi"
"887",6787698,6789865,"It was a week later that he...","Life of Pi"
"888",6791577,6793743,"Because of me.","Life of Pi"
"889",6793912,6796872,"Because I couldn'thold on to a stupid turtle.","Life of Pi"
"890",6797416,6799917,"It slipped out of my handsand swam away.","Life of Pi"
"891",6800085,6802420,"And the cook came up and he punchedme on the side of my head...","Life of Pi"
"892",6802587,6804796,"and my teeth clacked and I saw stars.","Life of Pi"
"893",6804965,6806131,"I thought he wasgoing to hit me again...","Life of Pi"
"894",6806300,6808259,"but Mother started poundingon him with her fists...","Life of Pi"
"895",6810386,6811845,"She yelled at me to go to the raft.","Life of Pi"
"896",6813765,6816559,"I thought she was coming withme, or I'd never have...","Life of Pi"
"897",6819479,6822105,"I don't know why I didn'tmake her go first.","Life of Pi"
"898",6824109,6826444,"I think about that every day.","Life of Pi"
"899",6832493,6836162,"I jumped over and turned backjust as the knife came out.","Life of Pi"
"900",6840082,6842585,"There wasn't anything I could do.","Life of Pi"

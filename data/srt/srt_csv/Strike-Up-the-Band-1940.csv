"1297",5760554,5762749,"They're the same people.","Strike Up the Band"

"1302",5785713,5787510,"I know it now.","Strike Up the Band"
"1303",5788349,5790943,"I guess I just didn't stop to think.","Strike Up the Band"
"1304",5792286,5794254,"I thought it'd be wonderfulfor both of us.","Strike Up the Band"
"1305",5794421,5796889,"And so it can be, Jimmy.","Strike Up the Band"
"1306",5797191,5800024,"But not quite so fast.","Strike Up the Band"

"1308",5811739,5813604,"You know where I'm going.","Strike Up the Band"
"1309",5818646,5822309,"So I'm afraid I won't be ableto accept the job, Mr. Whiteman.","Strike Up the Band"
"1310",5822483,5825816,"I thought I could, but I just gotthrough talking to my mother and...","Strike Up the Band"
"1311",5825986,5828716,"Well, she straightened me outon a few things.","Strike Up the Band"
"1312",5828889,5831756,"Mothers have a knack at that sort of thing,don't they, Jimmy?","Strike Up the Band"
"1313",5831926,5834690,"Yes, sir. You know, ever sinceyou made that announcement...","Strike Up the Band"
"1314",5834862,5837524,"...about a guest appearanceon your broadcast...","Strike Up the Band"
"1315",5837698,5839893,"Why, that's been our ambition.","Strike Up the Band"
"1316",5840868,5842096,"We played dates.","Strike Up the Band"
"1317",5842269,5845636,"We even gave a show to try to raiseenough money to get to Chicago...","Strike Up the Band"
"1318",5845806,5847865,"...to give an audition.","Strike Up the Band"
"1319",5848042,5850670,"But that's before we knewyou were coming here.","Strike Up the Band"
"1320",5850845,5852540,"Jimmy, did you form that band?","Strike Up the Band"
"1321",5852980,5854379,"Yes, sir.","Strike Up the Band"
"1322",5855916,5857941,"I kind of cooked it up.","Strike Up the Band"
"1323",5859820,5862050,"But I can't very wellpull out on them now.","Strike Up the Band"
"1324",5864491,5867756,"That's good enough for me.Jimmy, let me tell you something.","Strike Up the Band"
"1325",5867928,5870954,"When I started out, a band wasa bunch of boys with instruments...","Strike Up the Band"
"1326",5871131,5874726,"...who got together and beat out rhythmfor the rest of the folks to dance to.","Strike Up the Band"
"1327",5874902,5877496,"But now it's a profession,and a mighty important one.","Strike Up the Band"
"1328",5877671,5881368,"Take the big bandleader of today.He's almost a household word.","Strike Up the Band"
"1329",5881542,5885273,"He's as well known as yourbiggest picture actor or baseball player.","Strike Up the Band"
"1330",5885446,5889644,"Fred Waring, Kay Kyser, Glenn Miller.All very popular.","Strike Up the Band"
"1331",5889817,5892980,"But once they were a little guycalled Jimmy Connors who...","Strike Up the Band"
"1332",5893153,5894711,"...just sort of cooked things up.","Strike Up the Band"
"1333",5897091,5899582,"But with this popularitycomes a great responsibility.","Strike Up the Band"
"1334",5900227,5903993,"Rhythm can either excite the worst in usor bring out the best.","Strike Up the Band"
"1335",5904164,5905995,"Take that little fellow on the street.","Strike Up the Band"
"1336",5906166,5908896,"Teach him to blow a hornand he'll never blow a safe.","Strike Up the Band"
"1337",5909069,5912004,"You know, rhythm is reallya wonderful thing.","Strike Up the Band"
"1338",5912172,5914800,"Sometimes I thinkrhythm almost runs the world.","Strike Up the Band"
"1339",5914975,5919275,"In a little baby, the first thing that startsis his rhythm. His little heart starts to beat.","Strike Up the Band"
"1340",5919446,5922006,"And every different cityhas a different kind of rhythm.","Strike Up the Band"
"1341",5922182,5924514,"In your car,if the engine's missing and jerking...","Strike Up the Band"
"1342",5924685,5928086,"...or you feel the bump of a flat tire,rhythm tells something's wrong.","Strike Up the Band"
"1343",5928255,5931520,"And if you call a doctor,the first thing he does is check your rhythm.","Strike Up the Band"
"1344",5931692,5935719,"He feels your pulse to find if your rhythmis solid and your beat's strong.","Strike Up the Band"
"1345",5935896,5939059,"So, Jimmy, when we getto the last eight bars of the big tune...","Strike Up the Band"
"1346",5939233,5942168,"...and the old tickerkind of slows down...","Strike Up the Band"
"1347",5942336,5946966,"...no matter what's wrong with us,the last thing to stop is our rhythm.","Strike Up the Band"
"1348",5951946,5954540,"After listening to a lot of bandsall over the country...","Strike Up the Band"
"1349",5954715,5958879,"...I don't think it would be fair to select oneand give them the guest spot on that show.","Strike Up the Band"
"1350",5959053,5961578,"No, there's too many good ones.","Strike Up the Band"
"1351",5962156,5963623,"I've put up a $500 prize...","Strike Up the Band"
"1352",5963791,5967750,"...and I'm gonna devote my wholeprogram for a high school band contest.","Strike Up the Band"
"1353",5967928,5969122,"I'm going to play it safe.","Strike Up the Band"
"1354",5969296,5971457,"I'm gonna let the publicworry about who's best.","Strike Up the Band"
"1355",5971632,5973691,"Gosh, that sounds terrific, Mr. Whiteman.","Strike Up the Band"
"1356",5973867,5977963,"I've already selected three bands,but I think I'll make it four.","Strike Up the Band"
"1357",5978138,5979935,"Do you want to try?","Strike Up the Band"
"1358",5981842,5984367,"- Do we?- Chicago, Saturday night.","Strike Up the Band"
"1359",5984545,5988140,"- Will you be there?- Why, you couldn't keep us away.","Strike Up the Band"
"1360",5992252,5995312,"- Well, what's the matter, Jimmy?- Oh, I...","Strike Up the Band"
"1361",5995689,5997589,"I forgot, Mr. Whiteman.","Strike Up the Band"
"1362",5997758,6001250,"It's gonna cost us $200to get the band to Chicago.","Strike Up the Band"
"1363",6001428,6005831,"I've figured it out.We've only got 150.","Strike Up the Band"
"1364",6008035,6013632,"Mr. Whiteman, do you think you could seeyour way clear to give me a loan of $50?","Strike Up the Band"
"1365",6013807,6015638,"I'll give you my personal note.","Strike Up the Band"
"1366",6015809,6018141,"Well, what have you gotfor collateral, Jimmy?","Strike Up the Band"

"1369",6024551,6026610,"You'd really do that, Jimmy?","Strike Up the Band"
"1370",6026787,6028186,"Yes, I would, Mr. Whiteman.","Strike Up the Band"
"1371",6028355,6031290,"- It's a deal. There you are.- Oh, gosh.","Strike Up the Band"
"1372",6031458,6034427,"Thanks. You won't have to wait long,not if there's a $500 prize.","Strike Up the Band"
"1373",6034595,6037530,"I wouldn't be too confident.You might get a little competition.","Strike Up the Band"
"1374",6037698,6040599,"We're not afraidof a bunch of kids from high school.","Strike Up the Band"
"1375",6041902,6043870,"- Hurry up, you're late.- Is everybody here?","Strike Up the Band"
"1376",6044038,6046165,"- Music hasn't been passed out.- Where's Willie?","Strike Up the Band"

"1381",6057251,6061688,"I'm so glad you've come.I'll call the doctor.","Strike Up the Band"
"1382",6062456,6064117,"Oh, I'm afraid it's awfully serious.","Strike Up the Band"
"1383",6064291,6068057,"- I hope not. What's the matter, doctor?- From what I gather, he injured his arm...","Strike Up the Band"
"1384",6068228,6070696,"...when he was swung upon that wire during your show.","Strike Up the Band"
"1385",6070864,6072889,"- His arm.- It's perfectly possible for him...","Strike Up the Band"
"1386",6073067,6076400,"...to have gone around all this timewithout knowing the arm was broken.","Strike Up the Band"
"1387",6076570,6077832,"That often happens.","Strike Up the Band"
"1388",6078005,6080496,"Unfortunately,what was a simple fracture then...","Strike Up the Band"

"1390",6083110,6085943,"And it is serious.He's had that injury for over a week.","Strike Up the Band"
"1391",6086113,6089310,"- What are you doing for him, doctor?- There's not much that I can do.","Strike Up the Band"
"1392",6089483,6092475,"It calls for an operationby someone who is an expert.","Strike Up the Band"
"1393",6092653,6094746,"- Or else...- or else what?","Strike Up the Band"
"1394",6094922,6098289,"Unless that boy is operated onwithin the next few hours, I...","Strike Up the Band"

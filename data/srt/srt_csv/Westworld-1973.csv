"235",1230429,1232627,"Just passing through?","Westworld"
"236",1233469,1234866,"Maybe.","Westworld"
"237",1235028,1237147,"Looking for some fun?","Westworld"
"238",1239107,1240708,"Maybe.","Westworld"
"239",1240868,1245146,"Well, you come to the right place.There's plenty of fun here.","Westworld"
"240",1245307,1247747,"That's Cindy and Arlette.","Westworld"
"241",1248867,1251307,"Arlette's from Paris.","Westworld"
"242",1251907,1254587,"Perhaps you gentlemenare taking a liking to them.","Westworld"
"243",1254748,1255747,"Perhaps.","Westworld"
"244",1255907,1258307,"- They're real accommodating.- John.","Westworld"
"245",1258468,1260188,"They, uh...","Westworld"
"246",1260548,1261906,"- They look it.- John, listen...","Westworld"
"247",1262067,1265346,"Why don't you just go on upstairsand we'll reckon accounts later?","Westworld"
"248",1265508,1267267,"- John, are those...?- Sounds good to me.","Westworld"
"249",1267428,1268866,"Are those two girls machines?","Westworld"
"250",1271028,1273426,"Now, how can you saya thing like that?","Westworld"
"251",1274587,1276307,"Come on.","Westworld"
"252",1288067,1289987,"What's going on?","Westworld"
"253",1291268,1294307,"- They're robbing the bank.- Robbing the bank?","Westworld"
"254",1294468,1297107,"- Hey, maybe we ought to go help out.- Uh-uh.","Westworld"
"255",1297268,1299747,"You don't know,it might be fun to fight bank robbers.","Westworld"
"256",1299907,1303467,"Look, Pete, this is better.","Westworld"
"257",1345988,1347787,"There, uh...","Westworld"
"258",1348627,1352707,"There is something I have to tell you.I don't know if it matters...","Westworld"
"259",1352988,1354307,"...but it matters to me.","Westworld"
"260",1361188,1363468,"I haven't ever had a, uh...","Westworld"
"261",1365188,1366747,"A...","Westworld"
"262",1367868,1371626,"Well, I hardly know you,if you know what I mean.","Westworld"
"263",1371788,1374426,"I mean, we just meta few minutes ago.","Westworld"
"264",1374588,1376426,"And, uh...","Westworld"
"265",1376827,1378988,"You're probably very nice.","Westworld"
"266",1398428,1399866,"I feel funny.","Westworld"
"267",1403788,1405426,"Why?","Westworld"
"268",1456508,1458826,"I think you're very nice.","Westworld"
"269",1467748,1470747,"How was it? Wasn't it terrific?","Westworld"
"270",1470907,1473386,"Boy, machines are the servant of man.","Westworld"
"271",1473548,1475467,"Wasn't that great?","Westworld"
"272",1475627,1476866,"Not bad.","Westworld"
"273",1477028,1481027,"""Not bad."" Now you're the big lover.","Westworld"
"274",1482188,1486626,"Well, you know how it is.Some guys have a way with women.","Westworld"
"275",1487948,1490027,"Shooting stopped.","Westworld"
"276",1491268,1493027,"I guess we missed the robbery.","Westworld"
"277",1495067,1496386,"You can't have everything.","Westworld"
"278",1497307,1498507,"Mm-mm.","Westworld"
"279",1499948,1502227,"- John...- Hmm?","Westworld"
"280",1502387,1505106,"...this place is really fun.","Westworld"
"281",1717708,1720146,"I think it's the gyro unit.","Westworld"
"282",1726307,1728986,"- What do you think?- I wonder if we shouldn't rewire her.","Westworld"
"283",1729147,1731826,"I'd replace thewhole unit rather than try to repair it.","Westworld"
"284",1731988,1733105,"With a 10?","Westworld"
"285",1733268,1734826,"Use an XX-50 if we have any.","Westworld"
"286",1734988,1736507,"The double X's have a longer lifespan.","Westworld"
"287",1736666,1738707,"A 50 may not fit in here.","Westworld"
"288",1738866,1742666,"Well, maybe you can shift theintegrator unit further up into the cavity.","Westworld"
"289",1742827,1744547,"I'll try.","Westworld"
"290",1748428,1753787,"- Mm. Balance servo again?- Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.","Westworld"
"291",1753988,1758066,"I think it's the sensor. But if it's thecentral unit, we'll have to open her up.","Westworld"
"292",1758228,1760945,"Well, you get a confirmationbefore you do that.","Westworld"
"293",1764988,1768426,"- What's he in for?- Central malfunction.","Westworld"
"294",1768748,1772227,"Another one? Hmm.","Westworld"
"295",1785906,1787186,"From the day we opened...","Westworld"
"296",1787347,1790747,"...we had a failure-and-breakdown rateconforming to computer predictions.","Westworld"
"297",1790907,1795467,"That is, 0.3 malfunctionsfor each 24-hour activation period...","Westworld"
"298",1795627,1796626,"...concurrent or not.","Westworld"
"299",1796788,1799905,"Now, this was an anticipated operationsaspect of the resort...","Westworld"
"300",1800067,1801866,"...and we were fully able to handle it.","Westworld"
"301",1802028,1805906,"The majority of the breakdownswere minor or peripheral...","Westworld"
"302",1806067,1807547,"...until about six weeks ago.","Westworld"
"303",1807707,1810865,"Then Roman Worldhad a rise in breakdown rate...","Westworld"
"304",1811028,1812866,"...which doubled in a week.","Westworld"
"305",1813028,1815626,"In addition, we sawa disproportionate rise in central...","Westworld"
"306",1815788,1818067,"...as opposed to peripheral,breakdowns.","Westworld"
"307",1818228,1821586,"Now, we identified some problemswith humidity control...","Westworld"
"308",1821748,1823547,"...and regained homeostasis.","Westworld"
"309",1823708,1827146,"Well, despite our corrections,the breakdown rate continued to climb.","Westworld"
"310",1827307,1829906,"Then Medieval World beganto have trouble.","Westworld"
"311",1830067,1832586,"Now we're seeingmore Western World breakdowns.","Westworld"
"312",1832748,1835866,"There's a clear pattern herewhich suggests an analogy...","Westworld"
"313",1836028,1840146,"...to an infectious-disease process,spreading from one area to the next.","Westworld"
"314",1840307,1843586,"Perhaps there are superficial similaritiesto disease.","Westworld"
"315",1843748,1847707,"It's only a theoretical concept.There are many ways to order that data.","Westworld"
"316",1847867,1852467,"I must confess, I find it difficultto believe in a disease of machinery.","Westworld"
"317",1852948,1855227,"But we aren't dealingwith ordinary machines here.","Westworld"
"318",1855387,1858146,"These are highly complicatedpieces of equipment...","Westworld"
"319",1858307,1860987,"...almost as complicatedas living organisms.","Westworld"
"320",1861147,1864386,"In some cases, they've been designedby other computers.","Westworld"
"321",1864548,1866987,"We don't know exactly how they work.","Westworld"
"322",1875387,1880467,"That input goes out at level 55for pulse forms of 039 duration.","Westworld"
"323",1880627,1882386,"We'll try to stabilize there.","Westworld"
"324",1882747,1885027,"Okay, my telemetry is good.","Westworld"
"325",1885186,1888066,"Repeat, I have good telemetry.","Westworld"
"326",1888708,1893267,"We have sunrise at 0.43.Ready on all quadrants.","Westworld"
"327",1893426,1895346,"Energize grid.","Westworld"
"328",1895548,1898426,"Grid energized. Confirmed.","Westworld"
"329",1899307,1904747,"All right, then give me 436,if you can patch that in. If not, 435.","Westworld"
"330",1904907,1908547,"I have sound now.Thank you very much.","Westworld"
"331",1908708,1911266,"Yes, I want scrambled eggs and baconand cinnamon toast.","Westworld"
"332",1911426,1913666,"Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?","Westworld"
"333",1913827,1916826,"Okay, send it downto Central Control Room, Console 3.","Westworld"
"334",1916988,1920746,"Wait a minute. Now, what was that?No grounding, Unit 5?","Westworld"
"335",1920907,1924826,"Try a bypass.I have readings on all units, 5 included.","Westworld"
"336",1924987,1926547,"Hold on a minute.","Westworld"
"337",1926708,1929866,"All right, let's stand byfor resort activation.","Westworld"
"338",1935988,1939826,"You ready on phase 443?","Westworld"
"339",1941387,1944026,"Four-four-three.","Westworld"
"340",1944548,1947625,"Okay, we're gonna activate at 59.","Westworld"
"341",1949587,1951227,"Lower gain Alpha 2.","Westworld"
"342",1955107,1957866,"Ready on six, on five, on four...","Westworld"
"343",1958027,1961626,"...on three, on two, activate now.","Westworld"
"344",2054827,2056106,"What do you want?","Westworld"
"345",2064268,2065425,"Not one word.","Westworld"
"346",2066547,2068865,"You mind if I finish shaving?","Westworld"
"347",2075668,2077385,"Have you no sense of de...?","Westworld"
"348",2119387,2120706,"Was he bothering you?","Westworld"
"349",2122507,2124146,"He isn't gonna bother you again.","Westworld"
"350",2124307,2125947,"Well, I'm here to tell you that thingshave changed.","Westworld"
"351",2126268,2127746,"There's law here now.","Westworld"
"352",2127907,2130666,"You can't go around pluggingwhoever you please.","Westworld"
"353",2131947,2133907,"But, sheriff, it was self-defense.","Westworld"
"354",2134068,2135706,"That's what they all say.","Westworld"
"355",2135867,2138505,"He shot a man.He'll have to stand trial.","Westworld"
"356",2138666,2140507,"Judge will be here next week.","Westworld"
"357",2140668,2143306,"If I were you, I wouldn't troubleover your friend here.","Westworld"
"358",2143467,2146666,"Judge Benson likes to hang them.Hang them high.","Westworld"
"359",2146827,2149106,"- Look, sheriff...- Beat it.","Westworld"
"360",2151347,2153146,"I said, beat it.","Westworld"
"361",2171586,2173867,"I've never been in jail before.","Westworld"
"362",2175027,2177186,"First time for everything.","Westworld"
"363",2180387,2182025,"But I haven't done anything wrong.","Westworld"
"364",2183067,2184865,"Well, you shot a man.That's something.","Westworld"
"365",2186588,2189585,"- Where you from?- Chicago.","Westworld"
"366",2190427,2193545,"Well, Chicago's a long wayfrom here, fella.","Westworld"
"367",2194467,2197027,"A thousand miles and more.","Westworld"
"368",2339186,2340226,"Hold it.","Westworld"
"369",2367106,2369905,"I guess that sort of makes usdesperados.","Westworld"
"370",2370067,2371985,"Yeah, I guess.","Westworld"
"371",2373746,2376266,"Well, what do we do now?","Westworld"
"372",2376427,2378905,"Well, the way I figure it,anything we want.","Westworld"
"373",2379067,2381985,"- There's no law in that town now.- I'll say.","Westworld"
"374",2382146,2386545,"- We go in there...- We do anything we want.","Westworld"
"375",2387146,2388347,"You know what?","Westworld"
"376",2389266,2392867,"- What?- I almost believe all this.","Westworld"
"377",2393027,2397025,"Well, why shouldn't you believe it?It's as real as anything else.","Westworld"
"378",2397186,2399985,"Yep. I reckon.","Westworld"
"379",2400148,2404465,"- What can you give me in Grid 7?- We have that on SM-514.","Westworld"
"380",2404626,2407385,"Transfer, now.","Westworld"
"381",2408427,2409865,"Transferred.","Westworld"
"382",2410027,2411065,"Reschedule.","Westworld"
"383",2411226,2413987,"She wants to meet the king.We have to restructure for that.","Westworld"
"384",2414146,2415346,"Can't disappoint a guest.","Westworld"
"385",2415507,2417306,"Listen, this is the third day in a row...","Westworld"
"386",2417467,2419067,"...that I've called youabout my laundry.","Westworld"
"387",2419226,2420505,"You've got all my shirts...","Westworld"
"388",2420666,2423186,"We're rechecking the tapeson the mechanism now.","Westworld"
"389",2423706,2428505,"We have programmed infidelity in thequeen as of, uh, two minutes ago.","Westworld"
"390",2429067,2433905,"All right, coming up on the castle.Zero, now.","Westworld"
"391",2434067,2437065,"It also conforms with yourfive-year history at this time of year.","Westworld"
"392",2440987,2442865,"Leave me now.","Westworld"
"393",2457226,2459065,"My queen.","Westworld"
"394",2464266,2467626,"If the king should hear of this,we would both be put to death.","Westworld"
"395",2467827,2471025,"I would be more than happyto die for you, my lady.","Westworld"
"396",2471186,2473985,"Let us pray it shall not be so.","Westworld"
"397",2474867,2476905,"I have news.","Westworld"
"398",2477067,2480905,"The Black Knight has returnedand seeks a match with you.","Westworld"
"399",2481347,2484425,"- The Black Knight?- None other.","Westworld"
"400",2484586,2486505,"Is he pretty tough?","Westworld"
"401",2486666,2491146,"He has the strength of 10,and cunning besides.","Westworld"
"402",2491427,2494826,"But his sight is weak in his left eye.","Westworld"
"403",2494987,2498025,"Stay to his left and you will prevailand win the day.","Westworld"
"404",2498186,2500865,"Confirmation of the reprogrammingof that Black Knight...","Westworld"
"405",2501027,2504545,"...for left lateral weakness andinstability for tomorrow.","Westworld"
"406",2504706,2506865,"I shall see you on the morrow?","Westworld"
"407",2507027,2508666,"My lady.","Westworld"
"408",2536547,2538266,"The schedule of tomorrow a.m.","Westworld"
"409",2538427,2542106,"It's his last day in the resort.Let's make it a lulu.","Westworld"
"410",2542266,2545025,"Tomorrow a.m., broadswords.Schedule locked.","Westworld"
"411",2545186,2547945,"We have a problem withthe air conditioning in Beta section.","Westworld"
"412",2548106,2549346,"Send a crew out.","Westworld"
"413",2549666,2551945,"Yes. He can be sheriffany time he wants.","Westworld"
"414",2552106,2554425,"That is correct.Just give him the badge.","Westworld"
"415",2566347,2569465,"Now, I'm the new law around here.","Westworld"
"416",2570266,2573106,"You think you can handle things?","Westworld"
"417",2575347,2577626,"You wanna try me?","Westworld"
"418",2604106,2606585,"A thousand pardons, milord.","Westworld"
"419",2608387,2610985,"What is your name, child?","Westworld"
"420",2611146,2612545,"Daphne.","Westworld"
"421",2613387,2615545,"Daphne.","Westworld"
"422",2616867,2618385,"Oh, I love this place.","Westworld"
"423",2619186,2620505,"I love my horse.","Westworld"
"424",2620666,2623905,"- I love my horse and I love Julie.- Oh, shut up, will you?","Westworld"
"425",2624666,2626385,"I like the spots on my horse.","Westworld"
"426",2626547,2629425,"- Did you see the spots on the horse?- Your horse is beautiful.","Westworld"
"427",2629586,2632065,"- Thank you very much. I liked yours too.- Thank you.","Westworld"
"428",2633467,2634786,"Look out.","Westworld"
"429",2634945,2636146,"Let me handle this.","Westworld"
"430",2643146,2644226,"Get it, get it, John.","Westworld"
"431",2659146,2660425,"Goddamn it.","Westworld"
"432",2660586,2663945,"- Do you suppose it's real?- Hell, no.","Westworld"
"433",2664427,2665826,"That's not supposed to happen.","Westworld"
"434",2665987,2668346,"Maybe it is.Maybe it's part of the thing.","Westworld"
"435",2668507,2673505,"The hell. Goddamn machines, anyway.That's not supposed to happen.","Westworld"
"436",2674106,2677106,"- A rattlesnake struck a guest?- He was shooting at it and missed.","Westworld"
"437",2677266,2679626,"Even so, the snakes are programmednever to strike.","Westworld"
"438",2679786,2682146,"- Was the guest injured?- Minor puncture wounds.","Westworld"
"439",2682306,2686025,"Inexcusable to injure a guest. Pick upthat snake for a total post at once.","Westworld"
"440",2686186,2690425,"Check all the snake's central mechanismstonight during the repair period.","Westworld"
"441",2697027,2699706,"Doesn't anything work around here?","Westworld"
"442",2772786,2775346,"Logic circuits on the snakesimply failed to respond.","Westworld"
"443",2775507,2777905,"There was no sign ofmechanical damage or tampering...","Westworld"
"444",2778067,2780266,"...and no clue to the malfunction.","Westworld"
"445",2780427,2782186,"Central mechanism psychosis?","Westworld"
"446",2782347,2784626,"I feel we should shut down the resortfor a month.","Westworld"
"447",2784786,2785786,"Oh, that seems rash.","Westworld"
"448",2785945,2788865,"Well, a snake injured a guest.We can't allow that to happen.","Westworld"
"449",2789027,2791786,"Many elements of the Delos Resortare potentially dangerous.","Westworld"
"450",2791947,2794346,"That's part of the appeal,but if they become truly...","Westworld"
"451",2794507,2795666,"I agree.","Westworld"
"452",2795826,2798025,"We can announcethat the resort is overbooked...","Westworld"
"453",2798186,2800865,"...and not allow any furthernew guests to arrive.","Westworld"

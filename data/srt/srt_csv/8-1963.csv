"135",590250,592350,"You have no idea whata job this was.","8"
"136",592450,595750,"No construction companywanted to take it on.","8"
"137",595850,597550,"It rests entirely on sand.","8"
"138",597550,600150,"How much concrete did it take?","8"
"139",600550,604350,"Tons! 400 tons.","8"
"140",604450,606550,"Commendatore, if you don't mind,","8"

"145",619050,620650,"Maybe she's in love with him.- With him?","8"
"146",620750,623450,"I pray day and nightthat I'll be spared a husband like him.","8"
"147",623750,625250,"What now? More climbing?","8"
"148",625350,626950,"I'd be glad to carry you.","8"
"149",627250,631750,"When I think he made me spend80 million on this structure.","8"
"150",631850,634850,"Wouldn't a well-crafted backdrophave been better?","8"
"151",635250,638050,"A backdrop! That's out ofyour grandfather's time.","8"
"152",638150,640250,"Besides, are they your millions,Conocchia?","8"

"158",661250,664550,"No. I'm not sad at all.","8"
"159",668750,671050,"The sequence starts with an imageof planet Earth","8"
"160",671150,674350,"completely wiped outby a thermonuclear war...","8"
"161",674550,678250,"Guido seemed glad to see you,really.","8"

"163",682650,685450,"seeks refuge on another planet.","8"
"164",685450,688950,"More than 10,000 extras,even 15,000, a tragic crowd.","8"

"173",717450,718650,"Dance.","8"
"174",726850,728950,"What's up with you?What's going on?","8"
"175",729050,732450,"Rossella, cut the big sister tone.It puts me off right away.","8"
"176",734250,736750,"Mr. Director, what part do I get?","8"
"177",742550,744850,"What does Luisa think about me?What does she want to do?","8"
"178",745450,747350,"What's my part? My part?","8"
"179",747550,748650,"Go away!","8"
"180",749850,751550,"You know Luisa.She doesn't say much.","8"
"181",751550,753250,"Not even to me,and I'm her best friend.","8"
"182",753850,757450,"I really don't know. She's lost.","8"
"183",757550,759650,"0ne day she says one thing,another day, something else.","8"
"184",760850,763150,"Unfortunately, I think the onlything she'd like","8"
"185",763550,765350,"is for you to be someone else.","8"
"186",765650,766750,"Why?","8"
"187",766850,769250,"It's the mistake everyone makes.","8"
"188",771650,776150,"But that kind little fellow,is he in love with her?","8"
"189",776450,779650,"You'd like that, so your consciencewon't gnaw at you anymore.","8"
"190",780550,782350,"You're such a scoundrel.","8"
"191",782950,788050,"Poor Enrico, he's so awkward.Everybody's noticed.","8"
"192",788650,791350,"He hangs around, listens to her,keeps her company.","8"
"193",791950,793450,"He's a great friend.","8"
"194",797550,799350,"I thought my ideas were so clear.","8"
"195",800750,804150,"I wanted to make an honest film.No lies whatsoever.","8"
"196",805250,809450,"I thought I had somethingso simple to say.","8"
"197",810750,812750,"Something useful to everybody.","8"
"198",812950,815150,"A film that could help to bury forever","8"
"199",815350,818150,"all those dead thingswe carry within ourselves.","8"
"200",820750,824750,"Instead, I'm the one without the courageto bury anything at all.","8"
"201",826350,831750,"And now I'm utterly confused.This launch pad to deal with...","8"
"202",834850,837150,"I wonder why things turned outthis way.","8"
"203",839350,841650,"When did I go wrong?","8"
"204",844450,846650,"I really have nothing to say...","8"
"205",847650,849550,"but I want to say it all the same.","8"
"206",851850,854850,"And your spirits,why don't they come to my rescue?","8"
"207",855450,857850,"You always said they hadplenty of messages for me.","8"
"208",858150,859850,"Let them get to work!","8"
"209",860050,863650,"I've already told you,your attitude is wrong,","8"
"210",863750,866350,"Your curiosity toward them is childish.","8"
"211",866850,868850,"You want too many guarantees.","8"
"212",868850,872650,"- Fine, but what do they say?- Always the same thing. Even now.","8"
"213",873650,876250,"They're very reasonable spirits.They know you very well.","8"
"214",877150,878450,"So?","8"
"215",880150,883950,"They say you're free,but you must learn to choose.","8"
"216",884550,888650,"You don't have much time.And you have to hurry.","8"
"217",891550,895750,"Guido, are you coming up?Yes or no?","8"
"218",943650,944950,"Room 320, please.","8"
"219",945050,946250,"Nobody's in.","8"
"220",947050,948250,"Fine, thanks.","8"
"221",991350,992450,"Have you got a headache?","8"
"222",993550,995050,"No, it's a tranquilizer.","8"
"223",995750,996950,"Do you take them often?","8"
"224",998750,1000250,"Sometimes, to help me sleep.","8"
"225",1003650,1005250,"What's worrying you now?","8"
"226",1030250,1031250,"What?","8"
"227",1031650,1033750,"Nothing.If you could only see yourself.","8"
"228",1034450,1035750,"Why are you laughing?","8"
"229",1036150,1039650,"I don't think I could ever betray you,if only because I couldn't bear","8"
"230",1039750,1044650,"the ridiculous effortof having to hide and lie.","8"
"231",1045150,1047050,"But obviously it's easy for you.","8"
"232",1047850,1051250,"Listen Luisa.I am very happy you're here,","8"
"233",1051750,1055050,"but I am very tired and sleepy.","8"
"234",1059450,1062850,"Sleep then. Good night.","8"
"235",1069450,1072950,"I don't know what you think mylife is like, reducing it all","8"
"236",1072950,1075250,"to the pettiness of somebodystealing from the cookie jar.","8"
"237",1075350,1078850,"What do you know about my life?What I hate and what I don't.","8"
"238",1079250,1080950,"I only know what you show me.","8"

"254",1224350,1226550,"I'll tell you what type she is.","8"
"255",1226950,1230450,"Exactly the type most likely to make","8"

"257",1236250,1238250,"Luisa, I didn't know.","8"
"258",1238750,1242050,"I'm seeing her for the first time,like you.","8"
"259",1242950,1245750,"Really, in a place like this,where there are so many people,","8"

"262",1254350,1255950,"You should have told me.","8"
"263",1258550,1261250,"What annoys me most isthat people could think","8"

"271",1283750,1285750,"How can you live this way?","8"
"272",1288050,1289550,"It's not right living this way,","8"
"273",1289650,1292050,"not letting others knowwhat's true and what's false.","8"
"274",1292050,1294750,"Is it possible that for youit's all the same? How?","8"
"275",1294850,1298150,"You're right. I know, I'm boring.","8"

"280",1312850,1315450,"What do you tell her?","8"
"281",1320450,1323850,"What disgusts me the most is thatyou've mixed her up in our life.","8"

"685",2844950,2846650,"You make my heart beatlike a school boy's.","8"
"686",2848350,2849450,"You don't believe me, do you?","8"
"687",2850750,2853050,"You inspire such deep respect.","8"
"688",2853950,2857550,"Who do you love?Claudia, who are you with?","8"
"689",2857650,2859450,"- Who do you care for?- You.","8"
"690",2862650,2864350,"You arrived just in time, you know.","8"
"691",2865850,2867550,"Why do you smile that way?","8"
"692",2867650,2870950,"I never know if you're judging me,absolving me, mocking me.","8"
"693",2871050,2874050,"I'm listening. You said you wantedto tell me about the film.","8"
"694",2874150,2875450,"I don't know anything.","8"
"695",2881550,2885350,"Could you leave everything behindand start from zero again?","8"
"696",2886750,2889850,"Pick one thing, and one only,and be absolutely devoted to it?","8"
"697",2890150,2892350,"Make it the reason for your existence,","8"
"698",2892450,2894750,"the thing that contains everything,that becomes everything,","8"
"699",2894850,2898450,"because your dedication to itmakes it last forever? Could you?","8"
"700",2899950,2902950,"All right, listen.If I were to say, Claudia...","8"
"701",2905750,2907950,"Where are we going?I don't know the way...","8"
"702",2909150,2911550,"And what about you? Could you?","8"
"703",2912550,2916150,"The springs must be nearby.Listen. Turn here.","8"
"704",2918650,2920750,"No, this guy here, he couldn't.","8"
"705",2921350,2924850,"He wants to grab everything,can't give up a single thing.","8"
"706",2925650,2926750,"He changes his mind every day,","8"
"707",2926850,2928950,"because he's afraid he mightmiss the right path.","8"
"708",2929050,2931050,"And he's slowly bleeding to death.- So this is how the movie ends?","8"
"709",2931150,2932450,"No, this is how it starts.","8"
"710",2932550,2934550,"Then one day he meets the girlof the spring.","8"
"711",2934550,2937350,"She's one of those girls thatdistributes the healing water,","8"
"712",2938350,2944850,"she's beautiful, young and ancient,a child and a woman already,","8"
"713",2944850,2949650,"authentic and radiant.There's no doubt that she's his salvation.","8"
"714",2951250,2953050,"You'll be dressed in whiteand your hair will be long,","8"
"715",2953150,2954650,"just the way you wear it.","8"
"716",2965250,2966650,"Turn the headlights off.","8"
"717",3005550,3006650,"And then?","8"
"718",3022150,3023450,"Let's leave.","8"
"719",3025450,3028550,"I don't like this place.It doesn't feel real.","8"
"720",3029450,3031550,"I like it enormously. Isn't that odd?","8"
"721",3035050,3037950,"I didn't get much from your story.","8"
"722",3038750,3042750,"A guy like your character,who doesn't love anybody,","8"
"723",3043050,3044750,"is not very sympathetic you know.","8"
"724",3046850,3050150,"It's his fault.What does he expect?","8"
"725",3051650,3053450,"You think I don't know that?","8"
"726",3054550,3057150,"You're a bit of a bore too.","8"
"727",3057450,3060250,"You really can't take the least bitof criticism.","8"
"728",3060550,3064150,"You're so funny with that big hat,made up like an old man.","8"
"729",3066950,3071750,"I don't understand. He meets a girlthat can give him a new life","8"
"730",3072250,3073650,"and he pushes her away?","8"
"731",3073750,3075450,"Because he no longer believes in it.","8"
"732",3077050,3078950,"Because he doesn't knowhow to love.","8"
"733",3079150,3081450,"Because it isn't true thata woman can change a man.","8"
"734",3081850,3083450,"Because he doesn't knowhow to love.","8"
"735",3083450,3086950,"And above all because I don't feellike telling another pile of lies.","8"
"736",3087150,3089050,"Because he doesn't knowhow to love.","8"
"737",3090750,3094750,"I'm sorry, Claudia, for making youcome all the way here.","8"
"738",3095650,3097850,"You're such a fake.","8"
"739",3098050,3099750,"So, there's no part in the film.","8"
"740",3100850,3103950,"You're right. There isn't.","8"
"741",3104250,3108250,"And there's no film.There's nothing anywhere.","8"
"742",3108850,3112450,"If it were up to mewe would call it all off now.","8"
"743",3117850,3119750,"Ah, here you are.","8"
"744",3119750,3123050,"Where did you go?We're starting next week.","8"
"745",3124350,3126050,"Your producer had a great idea.","8"
"746",3126150,3129150,"The greatest cocktail party everto launch a movie.","8"
"747",3129250,3131250,"And you know where?- At the launch pad. Tomorrow afternoon.","8"

"819",3463650,3465750,"These are tough decisions, I know.","8"
"820",3466250,3470050,"But we intellectuals, and I say webecause I consider you such,","8"
"821",3470350,3473050,"must remain lucid to the bitter end.","8"
"822",3473550,3475650,"This life is so full of confusion already,","8"

"828",3495750,3498050,"Believe me, no need for remorse.","8"
"829",3498350,3499850,"Destroying is better than creating","8"
"830",3499950,3502650,"when we're not creating those few,truly necessary things.","8"

"833",3509350,3512350,"For him, the wrong movieis only a financial matter.","8"
"834",3512450,3515850,"But for you, at this point,it could have been the end.","8"
"835",3516550,3519350,"Better to quitand strew the ground with salt,","8"
"836",3519450,3522750,"as the ancients did,to purify the battlefields.","8"
"837",3523250,3526250,"In the end what we need is...","8"
"838",3526250,3529350,"some hygiene, some cleanliness,disinfection.","8"
"839",3529750,3534150,"We're smothered by images,words and sounds","8"

"844",3550650,3551950,"And Rimbaud...- Guido, wait!","8"
"845",3552050,3554850,"...a poet, my friend, not a movie director.What was his finest poetry?","8"
"846",3554850,3556850,"We're ready to begin.","8"
"847",3556950,3560450,"His refusal to continue writingand his departure for Africa.","8"
"848",3560550,3561850,"Congratulations.","8"
"849",3561950,3565750,"If we can't have everything,true perfection is nothingness.","8"

"851",3571750,3575850,"0ur true mission is... sweeping awaythe thousands of miscarriages","8"
"852",3575850,3580350,"that everyday... obscenely...try to come to the light.","8"
"853",3581050,3585450,"And you would actually dare leavebehind you a whole film,","8"
"854",3586050,3589650,"like a cripple who leaves behindhis crooked footprint.","8"
"855",3590350,3592650,"Such a monstrous presumptionto think","8"
"856",3592750,3597050,"that others could benefit from thesqualid catalogue of your mistakes!","8"
"857",3598050,3600650,"And how do you benefitfrom stringing together","8"
"858",3600750,3602150,"the tattered pieces of your life?","8"
"859",3602250,3605050,"Your vague memories, the faces of people","8"

"864",3623850,3625850,"I hadn't understood. I didn't know.","8"
"865",3626650,3629150,"It's so natural accepting you,loving you.","8"
"866",3629550,3631150,"And so simple.","8"
"867",3631750,3634750,"Luisa, I feel I've been freed.","8"

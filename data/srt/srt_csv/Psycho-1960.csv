"348",2322237,2324405,"the way she spoke to you...","Psycho"
"349",2326282,2329201,"Sometimes when she talks to me like that,","Psycho"

"351",2334916,2336750,"Or at least defy her.","Psycho"

"365",2387469,2390721,"l guess it's nothing to talkabout while you're eating.","Psycho"

"885",5507543,5510253,"or done anything without telling us,unless he was stopped.","Psycho"
"886",5510337,5514175,"And he was stopped.So he must have found out something.","Psycho"
"887",5516386,5518554,"We'll start with Cabin One.","Psycho"
"888",5520931,5523934,"lf he sees us, we're just taking the air.","Psycho"
"889",5555926,5557134,"Bates.","Psycho"
"890",5607519,5609811,"-No shower curtain.-Sam!","Psycho"

"893",5613524,5617360,"Some figure has been added toor subtracted from 40,000.","Psycho"
"894",5617444,5618654,"That proves Marion was here.","Psycho"
"895",5618738,5622032,"-lt'd be too wild a coincidence...-Bates never denied she was here.","Psycho"
"896",5623158,5625118,"Well, doesn't that prove that he found outabout the money?","Psycho"
"897",5625203,5626912,"Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?","Psycho"
"898",5626997,5627997,"No.","Psycho"
"899",5628081,5631582,"But that old woman, whoever she is,she told Arbogast something.","Psycho"
"900",5631667,5634336,"l want her to tell us the same thing.","Psycho"
"901",5634796,5637463,"-You can't go up there.-Why not?","Psycho"
"902",5637548,5639466,"-Bates.-Well, let's find him.","Psycho"
"903",5639551,5642261,"One of us can keep him occupiedwhile the other gets to the old woman.","Psycho"
"904",5642345,5645389,"You'll never be able to hold him stillif he doesn't want to be held.","Psycho"
"905",5645472,5650394,"-l don't like you going into that house alone.-l can handle a sick old woman.","Psycho"
"906",5650729,5654064,"All right, l'll find Batesand keep him occupied.","Psycho"
"907",5654606,5656149,"Wait a minute.","Psycho"
"908",5656734,5659360,"lf you get anything out of the mother,","Psycho"
"909",5660070,5662238,"can you find your way back to town?","Psycho"
"910",5662323,5663907,"Yes, of course.","Psycho"
"911",5664658,5667869,"lf you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.","Psycho"
"912",5690935,5693979,"-You looking for me?-Why, yes, as a matter of fact.","Psycho"
"913",5694064,5695689,"Wife's taking a nap","Psycho"
"914",5695774,5699693,"and l never can keep quiet enough for her,so l just thought l'd look you up and talk.","Psycho"
"915",5699778,5703154,"-Good. You satisfied with your cabin?-Oh, it's fine.","Psycho"
"916",5777855,5780440,"l've been doing all the talking so far,haven't l?","Psycho"
"917",5780524,5782609,"l thought it was the peoplewho were alone most of the time","Psycho"
"918",5782694,5784944,"who did all the talkingwhen they got the chance.","Psycho"
"919",5785029,5787197,"Here you are doing all the listening.","Psycho"
"920",5787282,5789615,"-You are alone here, aren't you?-Mmm-hmm.","Psycho"
"921",5789701,5791284,"Drive me crazy.","Psycho"
"922",5792619,5795329,"l think that would be a ratherextreme reaction, don't you?","Psycho"
"923",5795414,5796957,"Just an expression.","Psycho"
"924",5797041,5800543,"What l meant wasl'd do just about anything to get away.","Psycho"
"925",5800627,5802378,"-Wouldn't you?-No.","Psycho"
"926",5808552,5809927,"Mrs Bates?","Psycho"
"927",5886922,5889298,"l'm not sayingyou shouldn't be contented here,","Psycho"
"928",5889384,5891260,"l'm just doubting that you are.","Psycho"
"929",5891344,5895012,"l think if you saw a chance to get outfrom under, you'd unload this place.","Psycho"
"930",5895097,5898432,"This place?This place happens to be my only world.","Psycho"
"931",5899476,5902854,"l grew up in that house up there.l had a very happy childhood.","Psycho"
"932",5902939,5904564,"My mother and l were more than happy.","Psycho"
"933",5966543,5968962,"You look frightened.Have l been saying something frightening?","Psycho"
"934",5969046,5970546,"l don't know what you've been saying.","Psycho"
"935",5970631,5974091,"l've been talking about your mother,about your motel.","Psycho"
"936",5974176,5976261,"-How you gonna do it?-Do what?","Psycho"
"937",5976345,5979264,"Buy a new one in a new townwhere you won't have to hide your mother.","Psycho"
"938",5979349,5982100,"Why don't you just get in your carand drive away from here, okay?","Psycho"
"939",5982185,5984144,"Where will you getthe money to do that, Bates?","Psycho"
"940",5984228,5986145,"Or do you already have it socked away?","Psycho"
"941",5986229,5989065,"-Shut up!-A lot of it. $40,000.","Psycho"
"942",5992862,5996323,"l bet your mother knows wherethe money is and what you did to get it.","Psycho"
"943",5996407,5998408,"l think she'll tell us.","Psycho"
"944",6000243,6003747,"Where's that girl you came here with?Where is she?","Psycho"
"945",6068645,6070229,"Mrs Bates...","Psycho"
"946",6090376,6092085,"l'm Norma Bates!","Psycho"
"947",6123242,6126536,"lf anyone gets any answersit'll be the psychiatrist.","Psycho"
"948",6126621,6129288,"Even l couldn't get to Normanand he knows me.","Psycho"
"949",6129372,6131666,"-You warm enough, miss?Yes.","Psycho"
"950",6132667,6134543,"Did he talk to you?","Psycho"
"951",6135378,6136546,"No.","Psycho"
"952",6138381,6143677,"l got the whole story, but not from Norman.l got it from his mother.","Psycho"
"953",6144889,6147390,"Norman Bates no longer exists.","Psycho"
"954",6148350,6151019,"He only half-existed to begin with.","Psycho"
"955",6151103,6154021,"And now the other half has taken over,","Psycho"
"956",6155524,6157609,"probably for all time.","Psycho"
"957",6159737,6161529,"Did he kill my sister?","Psycho"
"958",6161613,6164658,"Yes. And no.","Psycho"
"959",6165201,6168328,"Well, now look, if you're trying to laysome psychiatric groundwork","Psycho"
"960",6168412,6170663,"for some sort of plea,this fellow would like to cop...","Psycho"
"961",6170747,6173625,"A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.","Psycho"
"962",6173708,6176043,"He merely tries to explain it.","Psycho"
"963",6176628,6178880,"-But my sister is...Yes.","Psycho"
"964",6181716,6183801,"Yes, l'm sorry.","Psycho"
"965",6184886,6186595,"The private investigator, too.","Psycho"
"966",6186680,6191225,"lf you drag that swamp somewherein the vicinity of the motel, you'll...","Psycho"
"967",6194771,6197858,"Have you any unsolved missingpersons cases on your books?","Psycho"
"968",6197942,6200569,"-Yes, two.-Young girls?","Psycho"
"969",6201319,6204613,"-Did he confess to...-Like l said, the mother.","Psycho"
"970",6207118,6210871,"Now, to understand it the way l understoodit, hearing it from the mother,","Psycho"
"971",6211454,6214707,"that is, from the mother halfof Norman's mind,","Psycho"
"972",6215292,6217711,"you have to go back 1 0 years","Psycho"
"973",6218170,6221547,"to the time when Norman murderedhis mother and her lover.","Psycho"
"974",6221631,6226511,"Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,had been ever since his father died.","Psycho"
"975",6227555,6231181,"His mother was a clinging,demanding woman,","Psycho"
"976",6232685,6237396,"and for years the two of them livedas if there was no one else in the world.","Psycho"
"977",6237814,6239608,"Then she met a man,","Psycho"
"978",6240109,6243944,"and it seemed to Normanthat she threw him over for this man.","Psycho"
"979",6244697,6248408,"Now, that pushed him over the lineand he killed them both.","Psycho"
"980",6248993,6252746,"Matricide is probably the mostunbearable crime of all,","Psycho"
"981",6254206,6257167,"most unbearable to the son who commits it.","Psycho"
"982",6258168,6262963,"So he had to erase the crime,at least in his own mind.","Psycho"
"983",6266010,6267801,"He stole her corpse.","Psycho"
"984",6270347,6272681,"A weighted coffin was buried.","Psycho"
"985",6273434,6276019,"He hid the body in the fruit cellar,","Psycho"
"986",6276479,6279355,"even treated it to keep itas well as it would keep.","Psycho"
"987",6279439,6281649,"And that still wasn't enough.","Psycho"
"988",6282443,6286070,"She was there, but she was a corpse.","Psycho"
"989",6288615,6291408,"So he began to think and speak for her,","Psycho"
"990",6291493,6294037,"give her half his life, so to speak.","Psycho"
"991",6294663,6298707,"At times he could be both personalities,carry on conversations.","Psycho"
"992",6299793,6303296,"At other times,the mother half took over completely.","Psycho"
"993",6303756,6308551,"He was never all Norman,but he was often only Mother,","Psycho"
"994",6309970,6313347,"and because he wasso pathologically jealous of her,","Psycho"
"995",6313807,6316266,"he assumed that she was as jealous of him.","Psycho"
"996",6316351,6320896,"Therefore, if he felt a strongattraction to any other woman,","Psycho"
"997",6321899,6324650,"the mother side of him would go wild.","Psycho"
"998",6327947,6329989,"When he met your sister,","Psycho"
"999",6331367,6333659,"he was touched by her, aroused by her.","Psycho"
"1000",6333743,6335244,"He wanted her.","Psycho"
"1001",6337414,6341542,"That set off the jealous mother,and Mother killed the girl.","Psycho"
"1002",6343087,6346797,"After the murder,Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,","Psycho"
"1003",6347382,6351301,"and, like a dutiful son,covered up all traces of the crime","Psycho"
"1004",6351386,6354014,"he was convincedhis mother had committed!","Psycho"
"1005",6354097,6356432,"Why was he dressed like that?","Psycho"
"1006",6356891,6358768,"He's a transvestite.","Psycho"
"1007",6359770,6361270,"Not exactly.","Psycho"
"1008",6361896,6365315,"A man who dresses in women's clothingin order to achieve a sexual change","Psycho"
"1009",6365400,6367860,"or satisfaction is a transvestite.","Psycho"
"1010",6367944,6372448,"But in Norman's case,he was simply doing everything possible","Psycho"
"1011",6372533,6376036,"to keep alive the illusionof his mother being alive.","Psycho"
"1012",6377328,6379872,"And when reality came too close,","Psycho"
"1013",6379957,6383501,"when danger or desirethreatened that illusion,","Psycho"
"1014",6385837,6388965,"he'd dress up,even to a cheap wig he bought.","Psycho"
"1015",6389050,6393177,"He'd walk about the house,sit in her chair, speak in her voice.","Psycho"
"1016",6393261,6395471,"He tried to be his mother.","Psycho"
"1017",6397390,6400060,"And now he is.","Psycho"
"1018",6401979,6405230,"That's what l meant when l saidl got the story from the mother.","Psycho"
"1019",6405315,6408568,"You see, when the mindhouses two personalities,","Psycho"
"1020",6409153,6411820,"there's always a conflict, a battle.","Psycho"
"1021",6412782,6415574,"ln Norman's case, the battle is over,","Psycho"
"1022",6416409,6418828,"and the dominant personality has won.","Psycho"
"1023",6418912,6421706,"And the $40,000? Who got that?","Psycho"
"1024",6422875,6426543,"The swamp.These were crimes of passion, not profit.","Psycho"
"1025",6428797,6432509,"He feels a little chill.Can l bring him this blanket?","Psycho"
"1026",6432592,6434551,"-Oh, sure.-All right.","Psycho"
"1027",6446940,6448315,"Thank you.","Psycho"
"1028",6455949,6459202,"lt's sad when a motherhas to speak the words","Psycho"
"1029",6459286,6461287,"that condemn her own son,","Psycho"
"1030",6461372,6465207,"but I couldn't allow them to believethat I would commit murder.","Psycho"
"1031",6465292,6469128,"They'll put him away now,as l should have years ago.","Psycho"
"1032",6469880,6471965,"He was always bad,","Psycho"
"1033",6472048,6477095,"and in the end he intended to tell theml killed those girls and that man,","Psycho"
"1034",6477179,6480890,"as if l could do anythingexceptjust sit and stare,","Psycho"
"1035",6480975,6483393,"like one of his stuffed birds.","Psycho"
"1036",6484145,6487646,"They know l can't even move a finger,and I won't.","Psycho"
"1037",6487730,6493360,"l'll just sit here and be quiet,just in case they do suspect me.","Psycho"
"1038",6496364,6499617,"They're probably watching me.Well, let them.","Psycho"
"1039",6500202,6503037,"Let them see what kind of a person l am.","Psycho"
"1040",6504247,6506666,"l'm not even gonna swat that fly.","Psycho"
"1041",6506750,6509502,"l hope they are watching. They'll see.","Psycho"
"1042",6510003,6511671,"They'll see and they'll know,","Psycho"
"1043",6511755,6516259,"and they'll say,""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly.""","Psycho"

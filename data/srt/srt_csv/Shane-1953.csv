"535",3340795,3344715,"Why do you alwayshave to spoil everything? Bang! Bang!","Shane"
"536",3344924,3348719,"A gun is a tool,no better or worse than any other tool.","Shane"
"537",3348928,3351555,"An ax, a shovel, or anything.","Shane"
"538",3352849,3357603,"A gun is as good or as badas the man using it. Remember that.","Shane"
"539",3357771,3363067,"We'd all be better off if therewasn't a single gun in this valley...","Shane"
"540",3363234,3366028,"including yours.","Shane"
"541",3366488,3369490,"What's all the shooting about?","Shane"

"544",3380251,3382920,"Shane, you better hitch up that team...","Shane"
"545",3383088,3388258,"because today we're really gonnacelebrate the Fourth of July.","Shane"
"546",3404567,3409571,"I'm supposed to say to the squatters,""I'm busted but you're welcome.""","Shane"
"547",3409739,3412908,"- It ain't that bad.- That's easy for you to say.","Shane"
"548",3413076,3416870,"I've been your friend a long time,I'm reasonable.","Shane"
"549",3417038,3422292,"- But something's got to give.- Out here a man can go just so far.","Shane"
"550",3422502,3427297,"I've gone along with the new law.I've stayed away from gunfighting.","Shane"
"551",3427465,3430509,"Sure, I've tried to buffalo the sodbusters.","Shane"
"552",3430677,3435013,"You got to admit,my men have kept their six-guns cased.","Shane"
"553",3437142,3439309,"And now?","Shane"
"554",3456119,3462040,"- I can guess what's on your mind.- Keep your guesses to yourself.","Shane"

"557",3470800,3473552,"No offense, Rufe.","Shane"
"558",3475472,3479433,"It's your own conscience eating on you.","Shane"
"559",3480977,3482060,"Conscience.","Shane"
"560",3487484,3490694,"Hello, Torrey.Something I can do you for?","Shane"

"568",3553049,3559221,"And here's to me, because I ain't a cowardand you ain't getting my claim.","Shane"
"569",3560515,3563642,"They're hot-headed.","Shane"
"570",3563810,3568730,"You'd get him to drawwithout any trouble.","Shane"
"571",3568898,3570941,"It'd be easy.","Shane"
"572",3571150,3576947,"You can't scare meany more than you can Joe Starrett.","Shane"

"675",4132086,4135505,"We made a safe range out of this.","Shane"
"676",4135673,4139926,"Some of us died doing it,but we made it.","Shane"
"677",4140094,4145682,"Then people move in who neverhad to raw-hide it through the old days.","Shane"
"678",4145850,4151020,"They fence off my rangeand fence me off from water.","Shane"
"679",4152398,4156860,"Some of them plow ditches,take out irrigation water.","Shane"
"680",4157027,4163616,"So the creek runs dry sometimesand I gotta move my stock because of it.","Shane"
"681",4163784,4167453,"And you say we have no rightto the range.","Shane"
"682",4167621,4171791,"The men that did the workand ran the risks have no rights?","Shane"

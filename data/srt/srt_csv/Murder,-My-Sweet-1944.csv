"544",2487434,2490562,"Naturally, certain elementswould like to show me in a bad light.","Murder, My Sweet"
"545",2490638,2493402,"It's entirely possiblethey have discussed me with the police.","Murder, My Sweet"
"546",2494542,2495770,"That is it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"547",2497144,2501308,"Sorry if I've upset your theories about me,which must be more elaborate, but...","Murder, My Sweet"
"548",2501382,2504510,"My theory's pretty simple.It goes like this:","Murder, My Sweet"
"549",2504952,2508115,"Marriott was a blackmailer of women.He was good.","Murder, My Sweet"
"550",2508289,2511884,"Women liked him around. His interestin clothes and jewelry came easy.","Murder, My Sweet"
"551",2513194,2517153,"But he wasn't the whole works. Somebodytold him which women to cultivate...","Murder, My Sweet"
"552",2517231,2519631,"so he could load them with ice,go out dancing...","Murder, My Sweet"
"553",2519700,2522931,"then slip to the phoneand tell the boys where to operate.","Murder, My Sweet"
"554",2524438,2528067,"And that is your pictureof Marriott and me?","Murder, My Sweet"
"555",2530077,2534207,"I am slightly disgustedand very disappointed.","Murder, My Sweet"
"556",2537418,2540319,"Don't look now,but Gussie the gun collector is back.","Murder, My Sweet"
"557",2540387,2542787,"I am very disappointed in you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"558",2543257,2547489,"Your thinking is untidy,like most so-called thinking today.","Murder, My Sweet"
"559",2547561,2548858,"You depress me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"560",2550030,2552191,"Suppose your theory were correct...","Murder, My Sweet"
"561",2552700,2554861,"I would have Mrs. Grayle's jade now,wouldn't I?","Murder, My Sweet"
"562",2554935,2558098,"- Unless something went wrong.- What could have gone wrong?","Murder, My Sweet"
"563",2558172,2562199,"Marriott could have lost his nerveand rung in a private dick.","Murder, My Sweet"
"564",2562810,2565779,"Take a private dick who'd risk his neckfor $100.","Murder, My Sweet"
"565",2565846,2567473,"He might get ambitious.","Murder, My Sweet"
"566",2567548,2571279,"He might figure an expensive necklacewould be nice to have in the bank.","Murder, My Sweet"
"567",2571352,2573718,"This hypothetical detective of yours...","Murder, My Sweet"
"568",2574188,2577783,"he might be willing to partwith the necklace for a consideration.","Murder, My Sweet"
"569",2578025,2579652,"Could be, if he had it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"570",2579893,2581588,"How big a consideration?","Murder, My Sweet"
"571",2582129,2585428,"It would be difficult to discuss thatuntil he produced the necklace.","Murder, My Sweet"
"572",2585499,2588525,"He might be bluffing,hoping to gain information.","Murder, My Sweet"
"573",2588602,2593437,"In which case, a great thinker might tryto shake something out of him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"574",2593841,2595570,"You wouldn't suggest that?","Murder, My Sweet"
"575",2598012,2601277,"Only if you wantedto wear your face backwards for a while.","Murder, My Sweet"

"583",2623604,2625538,"You get him to tell you yet?","Murder, My Sweet"
"584",2626273,2628434,"He refuses to tell me where she is.","Murder, My Sweet"
"585",2629310,2631335,"I gave you some dough to find Velma.","Murder, My Sweet"

"589",2646260,2649161,"How'd you get mixed up with these guys?What's the connection?","Murder, My Sweet"

"591",2651098,2653293,"If he tells you I know where Velma is,he's nuts.","Murder, My Sweet"
"592",2653367,2655301,"He just picked you up to do his dirty work.","Murder, My Sweet"
"593",2655369,2658827,"He's after jewelry. He thinks I've got it.Ask him about Velma.","Murder, My Sweet"

"601",2687034,2689525,"Let him go. He's tame.","Murder, My Sweet"

"812",3848494,3851691,"and you keep right on hittingbetween tackle and end.","Murder, My Sweet"
"813",3851764,3854858,"I don't think you even knowwhich side you're on.","Murder, My Sweet"
"814",3854934,3859530,"I don't know which side anybody's on.I don't even know who's playing today.","Murder, My Sweet"
"815",3859705,3862401,"Whatever's happening,you must believe in Father.","Murder, My Sweet"
"816",3862475,3864602,"- He's no match for anybody.- Take it easy.","Murder, My Sweet"
"817",3864677,3867976,"Randall probably picked up a scentleading from Marriott to Helen.","Murder, My Sweet"
"818",3868047,3871847,"He may not have reached your father.Anyway, we'll know soon.","Murder, My Sweet"
"819",3872118,3875417,"Skip the water and make that with scotch.Save time.","Murder, My Sweet"
"820",3891704,3893797,"He must be in his workshop.","Murder, My Sweet"
"821",3905117,3906311,"Father.","Murder, My Sweet"
"822",3907987,3911684,"- What are you going to do?- I don't know. I was frightened.","Murder, My Sweet"
"823",3912558,3915254,"- I am frightened.- The police been here?","Murder, My Sweet"
"824",3915661,3918653,"- Yes. What's it all about?- We don't know yet.","Murder, My Sweet"
"825",3919065,3920555,"Did they talk to your wife?","Murder, My Sweet"
"826",3920633,3924364,"No. She's not been heresince yesterday morning. I thought...","Murder, My Sweet"
"827",3925237,3928502,"- Has she been with you?- What did they have to say?","Murder, My Sweet"
"828",3929342,3932368,"They seemed interested principallyin our beach house.","Murder, My Sweet"
"829",3932445,3935903,"It was rented to Mr. Marriottindirectly through my bank.","Murder, My Sweet"
"830",3935982,3938348,"That probably held up Randalla couple of days.","Murder, My Sweet"
"831",3938417,3941580,"- Okay. Let's have a look at it.- Don't go to the beach house.","Murder, My Sweet"
"832",3941654,3944248,"- Yeah, why not?- Because it must stop.","Murder, My Sweet"
"833",3944357,3948350,"- The whole thing's gone too far.- Or maybe it's coming too close?","Murder, My Sweet"
"834",3948794,3953663,"I don't say you killed Marriott, but youcould've for a good, old-fashioned motive.","Murder, My Sweet"
"835",3953733,3956463,"Look, pop, the cops are moving now.They're mad.","Murder, My Sweet"
"836",3956535,3958332,"They're going to tag somebody.","Murder, My Sweet"
"837",3958404,3961237,"As long as I'm on the payroll,let's understand each other.","Murder, My Sweet"
"838",3961307,3963138,"I don't work by push buttons.","Murder, My Sweet"
"839",3963209,3966144,"I stop and I gobut I've got to have reasons.","Murder, My Sweet"
"840",3967313,3969076,"Forgive me, Mr. Marlowe.","Murder, My Sweet"
"841",3970650,3972242,"Forgive me, please.","Murder, My Sweet"
"842",3973986,3977683,"It's unnecessary for me to sayI'm an old man. You can see that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"843",3977757,3981215,"I only have two interests in life:My jade and my wife.","Murder, My Sweet"
"844",3981861,3984261,"And, of course, my daughter here.","Murder, My Sweet"
"845",3985464,3987864,"But my wife's the most important.","Murder, My Sweet"
"846",3988334,3991201,"- Do you find her beautiful?- Why not?","Murder, My Sweet"
"847",3991270,3994171,"She is beautiful, isn't she? And desirable.","Murder, My Sweet"
"848",3994840,3999300,"Maybe you think it's improper for anold man to have a young, desirable wife.","Murder, My Sweet"
"849",4001180,4003808,"I've played a little game with myself.","Murder, My Sweet"
"850",4004583,4007108,"I pretended that she would havebecome my wife...","Murder, My Sweet"
"851",4007186,4010087,"even if I'd been unable to give her wealth.","Murder, My Sweet"
"852",4010656,4012214,"I've enjoyed pretending that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"853",4012291,4015954,"It's given me great happiness.Pride, of course.","Murder, My Sweet"
"854",4018564,4022125,"But now I'm losing her. I don't know why.","Murder, My Sweet"
"855",4022201,4025637,"I don't understand what's happened.But I'm losing her.","Murder, My Sweet"
"856",4026105,4028903,"Ironic that it should bebecause of my jade.","Murder, My Sweet"
"857",4028974,4031306,"Because of that, a man has died.","Murder, My Sweet"
"858",4031677,4036080,"A paltry, foppish man of no consequence,who's better dead.","Murder, My Sweet"
"859",4036849,4039909,"Nevertheless, he's deadbecause of my necklace.","Murder, My Sweet"
"860",4041320,4044585,"I don't know why. But it must stop.","Murder, My Sweet"
"861",4045024,4047754,"It must stop, Mr. Marlowe! It must stop!","Murder, My Sweet"
"862",4054600,4056397,"What do you want me to do about it?","Murder, My Sweet"
"863",4056469,4059632,"You must go no further.The matter must be closed.","Murder, My Sweet"
"864",4059972,4061633,"I'll pay you well.","Murder, My Sweet"
"865",4063075,4066738,"Now this is beginning to make sensein a screwy sort of way.","Murder, My Sweet"
"866",4066812,4070839,"I get dragged in, get money shoved at me.I get pushed out, get money shoved at me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"867",4070916,4073544,"Everybody pushes me in,everybody pushes me out.","Murder, My Sweet"
"868",4073619,4075917,"Nobody wants me to do anything.","Murder, My Sweet"
"869",4078224,4080419,"Okay. Put a check in the mail.","Murder, My Sweet"
"870",4081761,4086323,"I cost a lot not to do anything.I get restless. Throw in a trip to Mexico.","Murder, My Sweet"
"871",4088067,4090160,"I'll be right back, Father.","Murder, My Sweet"
"872",4099812,4103270,"- Have you got a key to the beach house?- But you said...","Murder, My Sweet"
"873",4103382,4107648,"I bowed out. I stopped. He thinks it's over.That doesn't stop anything.","Murder, My Sweet"
"874",4107720,4111554,"These things don't work like that.Okay, so I go hide under the covers.","Murder, My Sweet"
"875",4111624,4115151,"Do the police stop?Does Helen stop? Do you stop?","Murder, My Sweet"
"876",4115895,4118295,"- What do you mean, ""Does Helen stop?""- I don't know.","Murder, My Sweet"
"877",4118364,4120491,"If I always knew what I meant,I'd be a genius.","Murder, My Sweet"
"878",4120566,4124434,"But I know this. A cancer doesn'tstop growing just because you ask it to.","Murder, My Sweet"
"879",4124503,4129236,"You're vicious. You take somehorrible sort of satisfaction...","Murder, My Sweet"
"880",4129308,4131435,"in seeing people torn apart!","Murder, My Sweet"
"881",4131777,4134746,"They're headed for it, anyway.You're headed for it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"882",4134814,4137180,"What you're hanging on to will smack you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"883",4137249,4140343,"If I fold now, it smacks you later.I stick, it smacks you sooner.","Murder, My Sweet"
"884",4140419,4143252,"But cleaner.Maybe that's why I'm sticking.","Murder, My Sweet"
"885",4143956,4148222,"I don't know, I'd stick anyway.Because a guy who hired me got killed.","Murder, My Sweet"
"886",4148460,4152726,"I don't want my kids to thinkI had to hit a guy 20 times to kill him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"887",4153098,4156261,"I could bust in,but a key would make it simpler.","Murder, My Sweet"
"888",4158671,4160002,"You drive.","Murder, My Sweet"
"889",4184396,4186387,"- Is that you?- Is what me?","Murder, My Sweet"
"890",4187066,4189159,"That nice, expensive smell.","Murder, My Sweet"
"891",4192104,4193503,"Quite a lad.","Murder, My Sweet"
"892",4222201,4224294,"- Someone's been here.- Sure.","Murder, My Sweet"
"893",4226972,4229873,"That's the first thing Randall doesafter a man's murdered.","Murder, My Sweet"
"894",4229942,4231603,"Mess up his house.","Murder, My Sweet"
"895",4236715,4237807,"Here.","Murder, My Sweet"
"896",4243088,4245386,"- Does that prove something?- No.","Murder, My Sweet"
"897",4246458,4248722,"Might have found my namein the classified section.","Murder, My Sweet"
"898",4248794,4250318,"That's what he said he did.","Murder, My Sweet"
"899",4250396,4252864,"Or maybe somebody phoned himand told him about me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"900",4252932,4256459,"But you didn't have anything to dowith all this until he came to see you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"901",4256535,4258935,"- Or did you?- I don't know.","Murder, My Sweet"
"902",4260372,4263739,"There are a lot of things I don't know.Some things I'll never know.","Murder, My Sweet"
"903",4263809,4266972,"- The only man who can tell me is dead.- Marriott?","Murder, My Sweet"
"904",4267313,4269804,"Yeah. All I can do is keep guessing.","Murder, My Sweet"
"905",4270783,4273650,"Let's get out of hereand go guess someplace else.","Murder, My Sweet"
"906",4273719,4275619,"All I can do about you is guess.","Murder, My Sweet"
"907",4275688,4280523,"You've only told me you went to thecanyon because you like your father.","Murder, My Sweet"
"908",4280592,4282958,"I could guessyou thought he might kill Marriott.","Murder, My Sweet"
"909",4283028,4286725,"But when you found me out therein the dirt, you thought I was your father.","Murder, My Sweet"
"910",4286799,4290860,"- Please, let's go. I'm awfully tired.- Okay.","Murder, My Sweet"
"911",4292004,4294529,"You know, that's a cute nose,even if it is crooked.","Murder, My Sweet"
"912",4294606,4297973,"It isn't really crooked. It has a bumpwhere I got hit by a baseball.","Murder, My Sweet"
"913",4298043,4299237,"Right there.","Murder, My Sweet"
"914",4299311,4302508,"I was playing shortstopfor the 7th grade, and...","Murder, My Sweet"
"915",4308587,4310612,"I'm a pretty good guesser.","Murder, My Sweet"
"916",4311457,4313948,"Your father really loves Helen.I can see that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"917",4314026,4315891,"Marriott did hurt him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"918",4316128,4319393,"When I appeared, you were afraidI might become another Marriott...","Murder, My Sweet"
"919",4319465,4321160,"so you tried to buy me off.","Murder, My Sweet"
"920",4321300,4324667,"That didn't work,and I began to suspect your father.","Murder, My Sweet"
"921",4325371,4329239,"A real tough guesser might saythat when he couldn't buy me off either...","Murder, My Sweet"
"922",4329308,4331503,"you decided to be nice to me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"923",4332077,4334910,"I don't always guess right.I may be wrong.","Murder, My Sweet"
"924",4339318,4341183,"- I think I am wrong.- Sometimes I hate men.","Murder, My Sweet"
"925",4341253,4343619,"All men: Old men, young men...","Murder, My Sweet"
"926",4344256,4346724,"beautiful young men who use rose water...","Murder, My Sweet"
"927",4347159,4350060,"and almost-heelswho are private detectives!","Murder, My Sweet"
"928",4353465,4356400,"I'm sorry, darling. I couldn't help laughing.","Murder, My Sweet"
"929",4356635,4359035,"You should know by nowthat men play rough.","Murder, My Sweet"
"930",4359104,4363370,"They soften you up, throw you off guard,and then belt you one.","Murder, My Sweet"
"931",4363609,4368273,"That was a dirty trick. But maybeit'll teach you not to overplay a good hand.","Murder, My Sweet"
"932",4368347,4371214,"It's not that she doesn't like you.She hates men.","Murder, My Sweet"
"933",4371283,4375276,"That was only the first half of the speech.The rest of it goes like this:","Murder, My Sweet"
"934",4375354,4379154,"I hate their women, too,especially the big-league blondes.","Murder, My Sweet"
"935",4379291,4382658,"Beautiful, expensive babeswho know what they've got.","Murder, My Sweet"
"936",4383462,4386761,"All bubble bath and dewy morningand moonlight...","Murder, My Sweet"
"937",4387599,4390659,"and inside, blue-steel cold!","Murder, My Sweet"
"938",4391236,4393932,"Cold like that, only not that clean.","Murder, My Sweet"
"939",4395307,4397172,"Your slip shows, dear.","Murder, My Sweet"
"940",4403916,4407545,"Father's worried.I'll tell him you're here and all right.","Murder, My Sweet"
"941",4409655,4411919,"- How long have you been here?- Since yesterday...","Murder, My Sweet"
"942",4411990,4415050,"Smart. The cops won't be back.It's a good place to hide.","Murder, My Sweet"
"943",4415127,4417823,"You're good at throwing lambsto the wolves, aren't you?","Murder, My Sweet"
"944",4417896,4420888,"Or did you just happen to leavebefore the cops dropped in?","Murder, My Sweet"
"945",4420966,4425027,"Look, I'd like to get a few things straight.You hired me to get your necklace.","Murder, My Sweet"
"946",4425104,4428505,"You were going to help me, so youstand me up in a crummy rum joint...","Murder, My Sweet"
"947",4428574,4431702,"and tell Amthor pick me upand shake the necklace out of me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"948",4431777,4435144,"- I'm sorry. I thought you had it.- What gave you that idea?","Murder, My Sweet"
"949",4435214,4438047,"Please don't blame me.You could've had it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"950",4439952,4443479,"- Was it bad?- It almost made me mad.","Murder, My Sweet"
"951",4443956,4446254,"How long have you really known Amthor?","Murder, My Sweet"
"952",4446558,4449049,"- I don't lie very well, do I?- Well?","Murder, My Sweet"
"953",4450729,4453061,"It's a long story and not very pretty.","Murder, My Sweet"
"954",4453132,4455965,"I got lots of time, and I'm not squeamish.","Murder, My Sweet"
"955",4465944,4467969,"Amthor is blackmailing me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"956",4470215,4473082,"I more or less figured that.How does it work?","Murder, My Sweet"
"957",4473152,4476849,"My husband is 65. He's in love with me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"958",4477256,4481158,"I'm fond of him. I'm grateful.He's been understanding, but...","Murder, My Sweet"
"959",4483395,4485590,"I've gone out with other men.","Murder, My Sweet"
"960",4488200,4493137,"- I find men very attractive.- I imagine they meet you halfway.","Murder, My Sweet"
"961",4494573,4498373,"When I first knew Marriott, I didn't realizehow close he was to Amthor.","Murder, My Sweet"
"962",4498443,4502243,"And it took me a whileto discover just how insidious Amthor is...","Murder, My Sweet"
"963",4502848,4505510,"- because he did me a lot of good.- What kind of good?","Murder, My Sweet"
"964",4505584,4509987,"He treated my centers of speech.Really, there's something to it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"965",4510055,4514287,"- I have a psychological impediment.- He did a swell job.","Murder, My Sweet"
"966",4514893,4516918,"You talk as good as I do now.","Murder, My Sweet"
"967",4516995,4520692,"His system is partly mumbo-jumboand partly the real thing.","Murder, My Sweet"
"968",4520899,4524596,"He flatters you. He gets into your past.","Murder, My Sweet"
"969",4524836,4526827,"You talk and talk and...","Murder, My Sweet"
"970",4528674,4532974,"That's the awful way he works:Uncovering a basis for blackmail.","Murder, My Sweet"
"971",4533912,4536244,"Finally, he asked for the jade.","Murder, My Sweet"
"972",4536448,4539576,"I agreed. I had no choice.He knew too much about me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"973",4539952,4542182,"He threatened to go to my husband.","Murder, My Sweet"
"974",4542254,4544222,"Sounds like quite a past.","Murder, My Sweet"
"975",4545424,4548359,"A younger manthan my husband might accept it...","Murder, My Sweet"
"976",4548427,4551521,"or get drunk or divorce me...","Murder, My Sweet"
"977",4551797,4553264,"but he's not young.","Murder, My Sweet"
"978",4553365,4555424,"I think it would kill him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"979",4560105,4562596,"I couldn't risk it, so I agreed.","Murder, My Sweet"
"980",4562674,4565768,"Before I could turn the jadeover to Amthor, it was stolen.","Murder, My Sweet"
"981",4565844,4567607,"The man who took it made it clear...","Murder, My Sweet"
"982",4567679,4571274,"that if I called the police,my husband would know everything.","Murder, My Sweet"
"983",4572517,4575315,"That makes it an outfitthat knew Amthor's methods...","Murder, My Sweet"
"984",4575387,4578288,"or an outfit tipped offby somebody close to him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"985",4578890,4581222,"Somebody who knew what he knew.","Murder, My Sweet"
"986",4581526,4583687,"- Could've been Marriott.- I think it was.","Murder, My Sweet"
"987",4583762,4588358,"If he had thought Amthor suspected him,he might have taken you for protection.","Murder, My Sweet"
"988",4588834,4590324,"- Could be.- I'm sure of it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"989",4590402,4592870,"I'm sure Amthor decidedto kill him out there.","Murder, My Sweet"
"990",4592938,4596305,"He may even have counted on youtaking the blame.","Murder, My Sweet"
"991",4596675,4598643,"It's rough, but I'll buy it up to there.","Murder, My Sweet"
"992",4598710,4602646,"He'd hand your past to your husbandon a platter if you didn't fork over the jade.","Murder, My Sweet"
"993",4602714,4606582,"You decided to play ball, but the jadewas stolen with Marriott's help.","Murder, My Sweet"
"994",4606985,4609818,"Amthor caught on and killed him.What happens now?","Murder, My Sweet"
"995",4610856,4613222,"I want you to help me kill Amthor.","Murder, My Sweet"
"996",4617362,4620058,"It's the only way I'll ever have peace.","Murder, My Sweet"
"997",4620132,4622657,"Once these things get started,they go on and on.","Murder, My Sweet"
"998",4622734,4625259,"He'll never be satisfiedeven if he gets the jade.","Murder, My Sweet"
"999",4625337,4628534,"Why me? Because I'm handyand know how to use a gun?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1000",4628607,4630438,"Or just because I wear pants?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1001",4630509,4633774,"Don't say that. Please, I need you so.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1002",4634513,4635810,"I'm lost.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1003",4636348,4639044,"I haven't been good, nor halfway good.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1004",4639351,4642718,"I haven't even been very smart,but I need help...","Murder, My Sweet"

"1008",4656168,4657965,"But I can't find him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1009",4658036,4661267,"That's probably my fault.The cops had a half nelson on me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1010",4661340,4664366,"I tossed them Sonderborg.Amthor may have skipped.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1011",4664443,4667810,"Even if we find him, we've got to be goodto sell a butcher a steak.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1012",4667879,4669403,"He works at this stuff.","Murder, My Sweet"

"1015",4673518,4674815,"Have I?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1016",4674886,4676820,"He won't expect you to have it on you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1017",4676888,4680346,"He'll need time to get the money.You name a spot to meet later.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1018",4680425,4681619,"- For instance?- Here.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1019",4681693,4685424,"- What if he sends a stooge?- We don't play that way. We just wait.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1020",4685564,4687429,"Okay, he comes. Then what?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1021",4687833,4689164,"That's my part.","Murder, My Sweet"

"1030",4734579,4736342,"I went in the way I knew about.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1031",4736415,4738007,"It was simpler...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1032",4738083,4741610,"and I had a psychological trickto try out on foxy grandpa.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1033",4742187,4744712,"I thought it would give him a bang.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1034",4745190,4747317,"I thought it would kill him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1035",4786965,4789661,"He wasn't hurt much.He was just snapped...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1036",4789734,4792396,"the way a pretty girlwould snap a stalk of celery.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1037",4792904,4795668,"Only, for this job,you'd have to be a big man...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1038",4795740,4797731,"with a big pair of hands.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1039",4836114,4839174,"I got to find her now. I got to go away.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1040",4839251,4841219,"Sounds like a good idea.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1041",4841520,4845183,"You might get unpopularwith the police here, breaking guys' necks.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1042",4846424,4849916,"I know you didn't mean to kill him.You just shook him too hard.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1043",4849995,4853931,"You don't know your own strength.Relax, or I won't be able to help you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1044",4853999,4856433,"- You find her?- Is that your girl?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1045",4858837,4860202,"That's your girl, isn't it?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1046",4860272,4863605,"That's Velma. It says,""Always, Velma,"" doesn't it?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1047",4864142,4865769,"I don't like nobody to kid with me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1048",4865844,4868404,"Nobody's kidding with you.Somebody's kidding with me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1049",4868580,4871413,"I thought it was a phony.I had to make sure.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1050",4871483,4874213,"That was meant to nip up anybodywho was looking for Velma.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1051",4874286,4877346,"She wasn't like that.I'll tell you how she was.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1052",4877889,4878878,"Cute.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1053",4878957,4882085,"Okay, she was as cute as a cap pistol.She's still cute!","Murder, My Sweet"
"1054",4882327,4884795,"Do you want to see herbefore you go away?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1055",4885497,4886987,"You mean you find her now?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1056",4887065,4889533,"Yeah, I find her. Just now.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1057",4889668,4892296,"- She's okay?- Depends on what you got in mind.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1058",4892370,4894770,"- She's doing all right?- That depends, too.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1059",4895340,4897240,"Did you tip the johns off on her?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1060",4897609,4900476,"I wouldn't want Velma to serve no stretch.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1061",4901246,4904238,"What stretch?You two mixed up in something together?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1062",4904549,4906517,"You tipped the johns off. They got her.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1063",4906585,4908382,"Listen to me, and stop dancing with me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1064",4908453,4911115,"The johns haven't got her.She's got herself.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1065",4912257,4914122,"She wants to talk to you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1066",4914726,4917752,"Of course, things have changed a littlein eight years.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1067",4917829,4919854,"- Okay.- Tomorrow.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1068",4922133,4924727,"I'd like to pay you some morefor finding her.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1069",4928106,4929368,"Skip it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1070",4929841,4932503,"Here. Grab yourself a hamburgerand lay low.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1071",4932577,4935205,"See you here tomorrowas soon as it gets dark.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1072",4949327,4951124,"- You got that?- Yeah.","Murder, My Sweet"

"1074",4954766,4956290,"When do you come up?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1075",4957135,4958625,"You open the window.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1076",4958937,4961531,"I open the curtains. You'll see the light.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1077",4961606,4964666,"I've got to get set, so don't jump the gun.Don't move.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1078",4964743,4966608,"I'll leave the door open.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1079",4968947,4972439,"That was like lighting a stick of dynamiteand telling it not to go off.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1080",4972517,4974348,"But I had to know one more thing.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1081",4974419,4976546,"I had to know how the jade figured.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1082",5010221,5011654,"You're trembling.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1083",5011723,5014248,"I was afraid something had happened.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1084",5014726,5015954,"Did you find Amthor?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1085",5016027,5018552,"He's gone undercover.He'll be here around 12:00.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1086",5018630,5021064,"Let's get set. What's the program?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1087",5021299,5023767,"Pull the curtains and turn on the lights.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1088",5050195,5053062,"You told Amthoryou'd have it for him, didn't you?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1089",5058837,5060532,"Don't you like it?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1090",5061406,5062873,"I don't know.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1091",5063074,5066134,"I've never seen a necklaceworth $100,000 before.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1092",5068179,5069271,"Where'd you get it?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1093",5069347,5071872,"Lower left-hand drawerof my dressing table.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1094",5071950,5073440,"It was never stolen?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1095",5074619,5076746,"There wasn't any holdup?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1096",5076821,5078755,"You faked the whole thing.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1097",5078890,5082485,"I wasn't going to let him get it.It would have just whetted his appetite.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1098",5082560,5084755,"I'm not going to let him get it now.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1099",5085029,5087896,"We'll just let him look at it.He'll start quibbling...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1100",5087966,5090594,"Last time, he tossed his gun at me.Maybe he'll shoot it.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1101",5090668,5092363,"He'll never get that far.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1102",5092437,5094268,"Let's not talk about it now.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1103",5094339,5097502,"It's really quite simple.And then this is yours.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1104",5098409,5101845,"You're much too niceto be a grubby detective all your life.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1105",5103615,5106482,"You told Marriottthis thing had been stolen. Why?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1106",5106618,5110611,"It had to look real. They had to believeit actually had been stolen.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1107",5110688,5112815,"I had to pretend to buy it back.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1108",5112891,5115553,"- Marriott fell for that?- Yes. Why not?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1109",5118830,5120889,"I didn't really like him.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1110",5121132,5122724,"He wasn't any good.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1111",5123168,5126137,"But rememberingdoes something to my stomach.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1112",5126337,5128532,"You still think Amthor killed him?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1113",5128773,5130138,"Who else?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1114",5131843,5133003,"You.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1115",5133812,5134904,"No.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1116",5136881,5138872,"No, you can't mean that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1117",5144055,5145147,"Why?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1118",5145256,5147417,"I think the picture was a little different.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1119",5147492,5151690,"Marriott was scared because he'd agreedto help you kill a nosy detective...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1120",5152463,5154693,"the one Mrs. Florian phoned him about.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1121",5154766,5156961,"He had to help you to protect his interest.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1122",5157035,5158263,"You knew that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1123",5158336,5160827,"You belonged to him, and to Amthor...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1124",5160905,5164033,"and to Mrs. Florian, in her modest way.You supported them.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1125",5164642,5166769,"They didn't want me cutting in, either.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1126",5166845,5170281,"You wouldn't be worth blackmailingif I'd found you for Moose.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1127",5170615,5172276,"He might even have hurt you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1128",5172350,5175148,"And if Marriott hadn't been scared silly...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1129",5175220,5179213,"he'd have realized you were pushingus both in the corner. Nifty thinking.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1130",5179757,5182624,"One of us would get out of the car.Didn't matter which.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1131",5182694,5185094,"Either way, you had us separated.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1132",5185363,5188764,"Then you'd tag us one at a timeand get Amthor later.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1133",5193872,5196500,"It might have worked, too,if it hadn't been for Ann.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1134",5196574,5200476,"But my head's pretty hard, and killinga man with a sap is no work for a lady.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1135",5200545,5202069,"Please don't!","Murder, My Sweet"
"1136",5202547,5204071,"It's all true.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1137",5204215,5207446,"Suddenly, I was trapped.Everybody was closing in on me.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1138",5207518,5211147,"- I didn't know what I was doing!- You almost did it anyway.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1139",5211222,5214885,"- I almost ended up as dead as Marriott.- I didn't know what you'd do!","Murder, My Sweet"
"1140",5214959,5216824,"I can't go back now.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1141",5217395,5220330,"I'm so close to peace, so close.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1142",5220999,5222523,"Just Amthor.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1143",5223167,5225226,"But I can't face it alone.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1144",5225737,5227568,"Don't desert me now.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1145",5227939,5230407,"Sorry. It won't work twice.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1146",5233778,5236474,"It's a good technique,but it won't work twice.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1147",5236648,5238946,"I don't count the first time,eight years ago.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1148",5239017,5241747,"You were just learning.Moose was in love with you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1149",5241819,5243844,"I don't know what you talked him into.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1150",5243922,5246447,"Was it murder or something serious?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1151",5247825,5251352,"You almost had me, sister,because you almost told me the truth.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1152",5251462,5255626,"Sure, Amthor's blackmailing you,but you didn't give me the right reason.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1153",5255867,5258802,"It wasn't just men.Pop understood the men.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1154",5259437,5262133,"That was part of the setup:An understanding grandpa.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1155",5263308,5265105,"It was the clink coming up.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1156",5265176,5267804,"It's no good understanding the clink.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1157",5268012,5270378,"You still don't get silk sheets.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1158",5270782,5272147,"Don't do that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1159",5273651,5276415,"I've kept forgetting to tell you...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1160",5276487,5279456,"that you shouldn't kiss a girlwhen you're wearing that gun.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1161",5279524,5281287,"It leaves a bruise.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1162",5282193,5283592,"I'll try to remember that.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1163",5283661,5285151,"I could like you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1164",5286030,5287964,"I could like you a lot.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1165",5288900,5291095,"It's too bad it has to be like this.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1166",5294839,5295965,"Don't move.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1167",5297241,5299471,"Come in.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1168",5304415,5307578,"Your sense of timing, dear,gets worse and worse.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1169",5307819,5311186,"I'm to blame. I insisted on coming.I was worried.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1170",5311255,5315282,"Why didn't you tell meyou were in such serious trouble?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1171",5315360,5316884,"I wanted to spare you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1172",5316961,5319691,"I might have been ableto help prevent all this.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1173",5320999,5322933,"Now, of course, it's too late.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1174",5323868,5325392,"Mr. Amthor's coming.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1175",5326504,5329632,"I think, perhaps, you'd better do it quickly.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1176",5334679,5336169,"Get his gun.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1177",5338016,5342715,"This'll be the first time I've killed anyoneI knew so little and liked so well.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1178",5343921,5345513,"What's your first name?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1179",5345656,5347123,"Philip, for short.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1180",5348359,5351157,"Philip Marlowe. A name for a duke.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1181",5352230,5354095,"And you're just a nice mug.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1182",5354599,5358558,"I've got a name for a duchess:Mrs. Lewin Lockridge Grayle.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1183",5359670,5361228,"Just a couple of mugs.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1184",5362740,5364571,"We could have got along.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1185",5364642,5368373,"What's stopping us now?I can handle Moose. He's in love with you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1186",5368446,5371438,"He broke Amthor's neckbecause he's in love with you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1187",5376387,5377752,"Then that leaves only you.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1188",5377822,5380382,"I don't want to do anythingabout you now. I know enough.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1189",5380458,5382153,"You know too much.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1190",5382660,5384150,"It's gone too far...","Murder, My Sweet"
"1191",5385897,5387296,"and I'm so tired.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1192",5409454,5411046,"Let's have the police.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1193",5412190,5414488,"Don't you realize he saved your life?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1194",5414559,5417221,"Why must he suffer for that?Why must he suffer more?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1195",5417295,5419661,"The cops like to solve murdersdone with my gun.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1196",5419730,5421630,"She's dead. Isn't that enough?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1197",5421699,5423530,"She was evil, all evil.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1198",5423601,5426399,"What difference can it possibly makewho killed her?","Murder, My Sweet"
"1199",5431976,5434706,"You don't call me. I hear it, so I come up.","Murder, My Sweet"
"1200",5438583,5440710,"I'd like to talk to Velma now.","Murder, My Sweet"

"404",2425713,2428945,"So, Stephen, in summary,","The Theory of Everything"
"405",2429545,2432449,"as we know, chapter one, full of holes,","The Theory of Everything"
"406",2433548,2436800,"lacks mathematical support.Professor Thorne?","The Theory of Everything"
"407",2436900,2439690,"Chapter two, not really original.","The Theory of Everything"
"408",2439789,2441692,"Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.","The Theory of Everything"
"409",2441791,2444061,"Well, at least you run with them.","The Theory of Everything"
"410",2444860,2448331,"Chapter three,too many unanswered questions.","The Theory of Everything"
"411",2448431,2449235,"I agree.","The Theory of Everything"
"412",2449335,2451867,"And then, of course,we have chapter four.","The Theory of Everything"

"665",3914817,3916483,"Stephen's done a U-turn.","The Theory of Everything"
"666",3916583,3920855,"The big new idea is that the universehas no boundaries at all.","The Theory of Everything"

"668",3922989,3925195,"And no God.","The Theory of Everything"
"669",3926094,3929365,"Oh, I see. I... I thought that...","The Theory of Everything"
"670",3929465,3933610,"you'd proved the universe had a beginningand thus a need for a creator.","The Theory of Everything"
"671",3935170,3936306,"My mistake.","The Theory of Everything"
"672",3936405,3939750,"No, mine.","The Theory of Everything"
"673",3941590,3946784,"Stephen is looking for a single theorythat explains all the forces in the universe.","The Theory of Everything"
"674",3947485,3949552,"Therefore, God must die.","The Theory of Everything"
"675",3949652,3952523,"Oh, why must God die? I don't see.","The Theory of Everything"
"676",3953083,3956067,"The two great pillars of physics","The Theory of Everything"
"677",3956166,3958630,"are quantum theory,","The Theory of Everything"

"682",3971009,3974378,"But quantum and relativity...","The Theory of Everything"
"683",3974478,3976514,"Don't tell me. They're different?","The Theory of Everything"
"684",3976715,3980052,"They don't remotelyplay by the same rules.","The Theory of Everything"
"685",3980253,3983956,"If the world were all potatoes,then, easy.","The Theory of Everything"
"686",3984056,3988994,"You could trace a precise beginningas Stephen once did.","The Theory of Everything"

"692",4003074,4005778,"- It just all becomes a godless mess.- Oh, dear.","The Theory of Everything"
"693",4005878,4008347,"Einstein hated peas.","The Theory of Everything"
"694",4008748,4013621,"Quantum theory. He said,""God doesn't play dice with the universe.""","The Theory of Everything"
"695",4013922,4017657,"Seems he not only plays dice,","The Theory of Everything"

"911",5629997,5631966,"That's tightened up.","The Theory of Everything"
"912",5632867,5635668,"As you can see, it's height-adjustable","The Theory of Everything"
"913",5635769,5639038,"and we can change the angleto whatever Steve wants it at.","The Theory of Everything"
"914",5639139,5641341,"- You know, it's cutting-edge.- So, how does it work?","The Theory of Everything"
"915",5641442,5644979,"It uses a very simple interfacethat scans through the alphabet,","The Theory of Everything"
"916",5645078,5648497,"selects each letter one at a time.I mean, using this technique,","The Theory of Everything"
"917",5648596,5652386,"the Professor can expect to writeabout four words per minute.","The Theory of Everything"
"918",5652487,5654456,"Good. Better than one a minute.","The Theory of Everything"
"919",5654555,5656225,"Yes, and what I've done","The Theory of Everything"
"920",5656324,5659395,"is taken the components from atelephone answering system, actually,","The Theory of Everything"

sang all day before you purchased it.","Sabotage"

frying bacon.","Sabotage"

makes me look silly.","Sabotage"

department. Don’t you?","Sabotage"

- You are right, my friend.","Sabotage"

with some strawberry jam, then ...","Sabotage"

and the hour, 1:45.","Sabotage"

who envies you.","Sabotage"

always until now.","Sabotage"
"327",1751885,1755535,"But alas, I’mno longer wanted
in the frontline.","Sabotage"
"328",1755586,1758375,"I must keep thefighters supplied","Sabotage"

"331",1772265,1778044,"Yes yes, perhaps you’re right.I must have put it there myself.","Sabotage"
"332",1782384,1785943,"There, there.No harm done.","Sabotage"
"333",1787253,1791653,"Well, I think,everything is quite clear.","Sabotage"
"334",1792413,1796933,"Slap me hard!Granddad’s been
very naughty.","Sabotage"

Why not?","Sabotage"
"336",1805554,1809933,"They probably knowtoo much already.
They’ll raid you one day.","Sabotage"

singing canary.","Sabotage"

at £1/6s themselves ...","Sabotage"
"344",1849213,1852453,"Of course, I realise, hewasn’t really a greengrocer’s
assistant at all.","Sabotage"

lunch at Simpson’s can he?","Sabotage"
"346",1856483,1859583,"He’s really quitewell off, and he's there
to learn the business.","Sabotage"
"347",1859634,1863673,"It’s one of a big chain,that shop. If you ask me,
I believe","Sabotage"
"348",1863723,1867693,"he’s the son of the man whoowns them. How would you like
a job selling fruit, Stevie?","Sabotage"
"349",1867743,1871073,"I wouldn’t mind with Ted.He makes it all sound fun.","Sabotage"
"350",1871123,1873753,"Wouldn’t it be grand to havesteak whenever you like.","Sabotage"
"351",1873804,1876833,"- Crumbs, I’d have itthree times a day.
- You’d soon get sick of it.","Sabotage"

get sick of things you eat.","Sabotage"

with poached eggs?","Sabotage"
"354",1882833,1886093,"I think they’rethe worst things in the world.
I bet Ted doesn’t eat them.","Sabotage"

"356",1887983,1889394,"They’re beneathhis dignity.","Sabotage"
"357",1889443,1893433,"- I don’t think,Ted’s so terribly dignified.
- Well, he’s too dignified to eat eggs.","Sabotage"

"359",1896884,1898603,"Do you think, Ted willcome with us and sail it?","Sabotage"
"360",1898653,1903493,"- He might, if you ask him.- He’s more likely to,
if you ask him.","Sabotage"
"361",1903544,1907683,"Sailing boats is fun. Ilike it. But Ted knows about
all sorts of things ...","Sabotage"
"362",1907733,1909784,"gangsters and burglarsand everything.","Sabotage"
"363",1909833,1912733,"- How does he know?- He reads about them.
He says, gangsters are","Sabotage"
"364",1912784,1916433,"not nearly so frighteningas you think. Some of them
are quite ordinary looking,","Sabotage"
"365",1916483,1918884,"like you and meand Mr Verloc.","Sabotage"
"366",1918933,1920243,"Perhaps he’s right.","Sabotage"
"367",1920294,1923561,"After all, if gangsterslooked like gangsters, the
police would soon get after them.","Sabotage"

And if he comes here again,","Sabotage"

about yourself? About me?","Sabotage"
"431",2249577,2251927,"None that I canthink of. Why?","Sabotage"
"432",2251978,2258927,"Because he’s a detectivefrom Scotland Yard. That’s why.
Spying on us, on me, through you.","Sabotage"

You can guess why.","Sabotage"
"474",2508403,2511364,"But it’s not as easy asthat. In my job, you have
to do as you’re told.","Sabotage"
"475",2511414,2513293,"Well, what haveyou been told?","Sabotage"
"476",2513344,2516684,"Is it about the men whocame here last night. My husband
has nothing to do with it.","Sabotage"
"477",2516733,2521711,"You’ve got to realise that.Speaking their own business
about the cinema.","Sabotage"

business was.","Sabotage"

done anything wrong.","Sabotage"

"481",2530592,2532052,"Why do you sayit like that?","Sabotage"

connected with sabotage.","Sabotage"

other night do you remember?","Sabotage"

one of them, yesterday.","Sabotage"
"495",2639101,2641521,"Stevie!","Sabotage"
"496",2649731,2653842,"- They’re beauties.Which one’s the hen?
- I think you’ll have to wait","Sabotage"
"497",2653891,2655371,"until one of themlays an egg.","Sabotage"
"498",2655422,2659722,"Wouldn’t it fool everybody,if one day the gent laid an egg.
Gosh, wouldn’t that be funny.","Sabotage"
"499",2659771,2661181,"You are right.","Sabotage"
"500",2661231,2665032,"Oh, by the way, has thatspool reel gone over

know, kill two birds with one stone.","Sabotage"
"504",2676280,2679519,"- Not my birds!- No no. They’ll be
here when you come back.","Sabotage"

than they will in town.","Sabotage"
"507",2688239,2691820,"But he can’t come rightover here and fetch it
so what they do is this.","Sabotage"
"508",2691869,2694659,"You leave it inthe cloakroom of
Piccadilly Circus","Sabotage"
"509",2694710,2697260,"and Harris picks it upat half past one.","Sabotage"
"510",2697309,2699420,"But can he get itwithout the ticket?","Sabotage"
"511",2699469,2702920,"Oh that’s alright, youleave the ticket with the man.","Sabotage"
"512",2702969,2707369,"Harris knows me.We’ve done this before.","Sabotage"
"513",2707539,2710679,"- You better get along now.- Oh, there’s no hurry.","Sabotage"

- I’m taking a two-reeler
over to the Canterbury.","Sabotage"

juicy one. Have you seen it?","Sabotage"
"527",2791750,2794670,"- Fourteen times.- Quite a wrench
parting from it.","Sabotage"
"528",2794719,2796639,"- Well, so long,Bartholomew.
- So long.","Sabotage"
"529",2796690,2799480,"- Careful of the crossings.- I can look after
myself, can’t I?","Sabotage"
"530",2799530,2804650,"- Oh Steve, is Mr Verloc in?- Yes, I just left him.","Sabotage"
"531",2811420,2815797,"I’m afraid I’ve had toimpose on you, Mr Verloc.
I couldn’t afford to
let you in on this.","Sabotage"

"533",2820827,2824418,"I’ve come here toask your help, nothing more.","Sabotage"
"534",2824467,2826128,"I see.","Sabotage"
"535",2826177,2829248,"About those menwho were here the other night","Sabotage"
"536",2829297,2831168,"when I dropped in myself.","Sabotage"
"537",2831217,2836097,"I’ve been instructed toget a little information about them.
We’d be very grateful if you’d help us.","Sabotage"
"538",2836148,2839577,"Well, any help I cangive them of course ...","Sabotage"
"539",2839628,2843257,"About yourself, MrVerloc, when did you
first come to this country?","Sabotage"
"540",2843307,2847257,"- Can I get you adrink or something?
- Not now, thanks.","Sabotage"
"541",2847307,2849648,"We’ll I’ve got tothink now, let’s see ...","Sabotage"
"542",2849697,2853617,"Perhaps, it would bebetter if you put it down
on paper. Just a formality.","Sabotage"
"543",2853668,2859268,"Would you find a pen and ink.We could start right away.
You know, “I, Carl Anton Verloc — ”","Sabotage"
"544",2868708,2871728,"Now, ladies and gentlemen.I want to ask you a question.","Sabotage"
"545",2869248,2873068,"Now let me give youjust a little demonstration.","Sabotage"
"546",2871777,2876217,"- What is it, causesteeth to fall out?
- Why, a punch in the jaw!","Sabotage"
"547",2876268,2880077,"Process of decay,inevitable in all
human organisms.","Sabotage"
"548",2880128,2884637,"But decay can be arrested,instantaneously arrested.
And by what?","Sabotage"
"549",2884688,2887057,"- A copper.- Yes, exactly. But","Sabotage"
"550",2887108,2891737,"if I may say so, byrather more than one copper,
by a few coppers.","Sabotage"
"551",2891788,2896818,"I have here in my hand,a tube of that remarkable
preparation, Salvodent,","Sabotage"
"552",2896867,2901708,"derived from two Greek words:“Salvo"" - no more
and ""dent"" – toothache.","Sabotage"
"553",2901757,2907697,"Sixpence a small tube, anda shilling for the large tube,
containing four times as much.","Sabotage"
"554",2909818,2912978,"Now if somebody —Ah! I see here a young gentleman","Sabotage"
"555",2913027,2915068,"who will, I’m sure,be happy to assist me.","Sabotage"
"556",2915117,2919018,"- No, I wouldn’t.- Yes, you would.
Come on, bung him up.","Sabotage"
"557",2919068,2920697,"- In the chair, sir,if you don’t mind.
- But I ...","Sabotage"
"558",2920748,2924077,"- Allow me to relieve youof this toffee, eh.
- It isn’t toffee and I —","Sabotage"
"559",2924128,2926648,"Alright, alright, alright.Stay where you are.
Don’t get excited.","Sabotage"
"560",2926697,2932378,"Now then, here we are. Thefirst thing to do is take the
tube in the left hand and remove the cap.","Sabotage"
"561",2932427,2937907,"Like so. Then we pick upa toothbrush, and we squeeze
some of the Salvodent","Sabotage"
"562",2937958,2942818,"along the bristles, like so.Then, I want you to observe,
ladies and gentlemen,","Sabotage"
"563",2942867,2945878,"- that the young gentleman’steeth are very dirty.
- They are not.","Sabotage"
"564",2945927,2948248,"Yes they are. Now come on.Open your mouth.
That’s a good boy.","Sabotage"
"565",2948297,2950228,"Now we now proceedto use the brush.","Sabotage"
"566",2950277,2955148,"Now with your ordinary commercialdentrifices, what happens?
It is either too gritty","Sabotage"
"567",2955197,2959708,"and takes all theenamel off, or it ain’t
and it don’t take nothing off.","Sabotage"
"568",2959757,2962507,"But with Salvodent,that’s the happy medium.","Sabotage"
"569",2962557,2967905,"Neither too strong, nortoo weak. It performs the
functions that nature forgot.","Sabotage"
"570",2967956,2972715,"It cleanses the teeth,refreshes the mouth and
removes all traces of halitosis.","Sabotage"
"571",2972766,2974936,"- Hali ... what?- Bad breath, to you sir.","Sabotage"
"572",2974985,2977085,"- Same to you.- Thank you,
I don’t need it.","Sabotage"
"573",2977135,2980815,"Come on.There you are, now.","Sabotage"
"574",2981365,2985416,"Now ladies and gentlemen,you will observe that I have
unfortunately disarrayed","Sabotage"
"575",2985465,2989175,"the young gentleman’shair. But that is
easily attended to.","Sabotage"
"576",2989226,2994045,"Now I have here, abottle of Glosswell.
A shilling for that size.","Sabotage"
"577",2994096,2997815,"But I have a large size,four times the size,
which is only 18 pence.","Sabotage"
"578",2997865,3000076,"I will now give youa demonstration
of how it’s used.","Sabotage"
"579",3000126,3002726,"You put it on thehair like that, see.","Sabotage"
"580",3002775,3006186,"It’s a remarkable substance,which is guaranteed
to give the appearance","Sabotage"
"581",3006235,3009016,"of patent leatherto the human thatch.","Sabotage"

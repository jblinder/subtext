"102",572203,575001,"And they're so particular about visiting hours.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"103",575240,576902,"Would you be a darling and look under the bed...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"110",593359,597351,"Sing Sing, I mean. It sounds more like itshould be an opera house or something.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"111",597462,599054,"Black alligator.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"112",599932,603163,"You know, all the visitors make an effortto look their best. It's only fair.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"113",603302,606293,"Actually, it's very touching, all thewomen wearing their prettiest things.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"114",606404,608895,"I just love them for it. And I love the kids, too.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"118",616682,618274,"You'd think there was going to be ice cream.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"119",618384,621080,"Now, as I understand it, what we'redoing is getting you ready...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"120",621187,623552,"- to visit somebody at Sing Sing.- That's right.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"121",623655,626419,"You can always tell what kind ofperson a man really thinks you are...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"122",626524,628389,"by the earrings he gives you.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"123",628693,630524,"I must say, the mind reels.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"124",630730,631957,"May I ask whom?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"125",632063,634429,"Whom what? Oh, whom I go to visit, you mean?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"126",634667,636259,"I guess that's what I mean.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"127",636369,638302,"I don't know that I should even discuss it.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"128",638403,640668,"Well, they never told me not to tell anyone.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"129",640773,643240,"You must cross your heart and kiss your elbow.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"133",649514,650777,"Well, don't look so shocked.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"134",650883,652076,"They could never prove for a second...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"135",652183,654778,"that he was even part of the Mafia,much less head of it, my dear.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"136",654886,657582,"The only thing they did prove was thathe cheated his income tax a little.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"137",657690,660250,"Anyway, all I know is that he's a darling old man.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"138",660359,662553,"Oh, he was never my lover or anything like that.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"139",662662,664788,"In fact, I never knew himuntil after he was in prison.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"140",664897,666057,"But I adore him now.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"141",666164,668928,"I mean, I've been going to see himevery Thursday for seven months.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"142",669034,671434,"Now I think I'd go even if he didn't pay me.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"143",671537,673437,"- Shoes.- I could only find one.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"144",677777,679004,"He pays you?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"145",679245,681303,"That's right. Or anyway his lawyer does.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"146",681413,684042,"If he is a lawyer, which I doubt, sincehe doesn't seem to have an office...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"147",684149,685616,"only an answering service.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"148",685717,688413,"And he always wants to meet you at Hamburger Heaven.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"153",701299,702323,"There we are.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"154",702434,706097,"Anyway, about seven months ago, thisso-called lawyer, Mr. O'Shaughnessy...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"155",706205,708264,"asked me how I'd like tocheer up a lonely old man...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"156",708374,710706,"and pick up $100 a week at the same time.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"157",711043,714409,"I told him, ""Look, darling, you'vegot the wrong Holly Golightly.""","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"158",714513,717209,"A girl can do as well as thaton trips to the powder room.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"159",717316,719113,"I mean, any gentleman with the slightest chic...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"160",719217,721379,"will give a girl a $50 bill for the powder room.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"161",721486,724115,"And I always ask for cab fare, too.That's another $50.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"162",724222,726589,"But then he said his client was Sally Tomato.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"163",726725,729592,"He said dear old Sally had seenme at Elmo's or somewhere...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"164",729695,731754,"and had admired me a la distance.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"165",731864,734594,"So wouldn't it be a good deed ifI were to visit him once a week?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"166",734700,737668,"Well, how could I say no?It was all so wildly romantic.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"167",739871,741236,"How do I look?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"168",742774,745369,"Very good. I must say I'm amazed.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"169",745811,748870,"You were a darling to help, I couldnever have done it without you.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"170",748980,751414,"- Bag.- Call me anytime.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"171",752918,756513,"I'm just upstairs, or I willbe as soon as I get moved in.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"172",756654,757644,"Bye, cat.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"173",764529,767931,"You mean he gives you $100for an hour's conversation?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"174",768334,770096,"Well, Mr. O'Shaughnessy doesas soon as I meet him...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"175",770201,772226,"and give him the weather report.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"176",772671,774501,"Look, it's none of my business,but it sounds to me...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"177",774606,776234,"like you could get in a lot of trouble.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"178",776408,778171,"Hold this for me, will you?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"179",780846,782904,"And what do you mean, ""weather report""?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"180",783716,785980,"Oh, that's just a message I give Mr. O'Shaughnessy.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"181",786085,788315,"So he'll know I've really been up there.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"182",788586,790884,"Sally tells me things to say like...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"183",790990,793082,"""There's a hurricane in Cuba""...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"184",793192,796126,"and, ""It's cloudy over Palermo."" Things like that.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"185",796461,799828,"You don't have to worry.I've taken care of myself for a long time.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"880",3935960,3939623,"but since it concerns you, I thought Iought to talk to you about it in person.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"881",3940097,3941063,"What?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"882",3941831,3942798,"What?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"887",3955211,3956440,"Can I come in?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"888",3958148,3961514,"I guess so. Just a minute. Do I have a nightgown on?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"889",3962353,3965083,"No, I don't. Would you mindturning around for a second?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"890",3965188,3967657,"Oh, never mind. It's such a corny line anyway.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

"895",3979068,3980764,"Yes. I know all about it.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"896",3981137,3984197,"Certainly had him pegged wrong, didn't I?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"897",3985141,3989237,"I thought he was just a rat, buthe was a super-rat all along.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"898",3990179,3992306,"A super-rat in rat's clothing.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"899",3992849,3994943,"You don't even know the best part.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"900",3995351,3997911,"Not only was he a rat, or a super-rat, rather...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"901",3998021,3999784,"he was also broke.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"902",4000791,4003487,"Broke. I mean, but not a farthing.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"903",4004327,4007559,"His family has money, of course,but he personally is broke.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"904",4007731,4010996,"It turns out he owes $700,000.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"905",4011702,4014728,"Can you imagine anyone owing $700,000?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"906",4015773,4017070,"$43, yes.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"907",4018307,4022108,"Anyway, that's why he decided tomarry the queen of the pig people.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"908",4023579,4026014,"I'll tell you one thing, Fred, darling...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"909",4026416,4028782,"I'd marry you for your money in a minute.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"910",4029085,4032021,"- Would you marry me for my money?- In a minute.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"911",4033489,4036014,"So I guess it's pretty luckyneither of us is rich, huh?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"912",4036893,4037882,"Yeah.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"913",4040030,4042293,"Fred, darling, I'm so glad to see you.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"914",4047538,4049300,"What have you been doing?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"915",4051041,4052371,"Writing, mostly.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"916",4054844,4057405,"Sold a story. Just got word this morning.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"917",4057648,4061139,"Oh, that's marvelous. It really is.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"918",4062686,4063744,"But...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"919",4063853,4065913,"Only how does your decorator friend feel about it?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"920",4066023,4069219,"I thought you were supposed to besaving yourself and all of that?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"921",4069326,4070623,"You know something?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"922",4070728,4073492,"I haven't got around to telling her about it yet.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"923",4073996,4075896,"Look, why don't we go out and have a drink...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"924",4075998,4077829,"or take a walk or something to celebrate?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"925",4077934,4078992,"All right.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"926",4079103,4081128,"I think there's some champagne in the icebox.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"927",4081237,4082967,"Why don't you open it while I get dressed?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"928",4083072,4084039,"Okay.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"929",4085074,4088567,"I don't think I've ever drunkchampagne before breakfast before.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"930",4089780,4091940,"With breakfast on several occasions.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"931",4092349,4093873,"But never before, before.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"932",4093983,4096110,"Now I've got a wonderful idea.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"933",4096220,4098688,"We can spend a whole day doingthings we've never done before.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"934",4098788,4102225,"We'll take turns.First something you've never done, then me.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"935",4102760,4106024,"Of course, I can't really thinkof anything I've never done.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"936",4122645,4124841,"I've never been for a walk in the morning before.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"937",4124948,4126972,"At least not since I've been in New York.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"938",4127083,4128573,"I've walked up Fifth Avenue at 6:00...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"939",4128685,4130515,"but as far as I'm concerned, that's still night.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"940",4130621,4133886,"- Do you think it counts?- Sure it counts. Now we're even.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"941",4147436,4150132,"- Don't you just love it?- Love what?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"942",4150506,4151769,"Tiffany's.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"943",4162252,4163844,"Isn't it wonderful?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"944",4164188,4166349,"You see what I mean how nothingbad could ever happen to you...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"945",4166456,4167582,"in a place like this?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"946",4167690,4171457,"It isn't that I give a hoot aboutjewelry, except diamonds, of course.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"947",4172462,4173929,"Like that.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"948",4180503,4181868,"What do you think?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"949",4182573,4183733,"Well...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"950",4186009,4190036,"Of course, personally, I think it wouldbe tacky to wear diamonds before I'm 40.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"951",4190213,4193546,"Well, you're right. But in themeantime, you should have something.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"952",4193649,4195048,"I'll wait.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"953",4195152,4197346,"No. I'm gonna buy you a present.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"954",4197654,4200315,"You bought me one, a typewriterribbon, and it brought me luck.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"955",4200423,4202483,"All right, but Tiffany's can be pretty expensive.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"956",4202592,4205083,"I've got my check and $10.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"957",4205194,4207322,"Oh, I wouldn't let you cash your check.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"958",4207597,4210965,"But a present for $10 or under, that I'll accept.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"959",4211768,4215828,"Of course, I don't exactly know what we'regoing to find at Tiffany's for $10.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"960",4225349,4226680,"May I help you?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"961",4227149,4230051,"Perhaps. Actually, we were lookingfor a present for the lady.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"962",4230153,4231279,"Certainly, sir.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"963",4231387,4233855,"Is there something special you had in mind?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"964",4234725,4236750,"Well, we had considered diamonds.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"965",4237426,4238724,"Now, I don't want to offend you...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"966",4238828,4241627,"but the lady feels that diamonds are tacky for her.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"967",4243266,4245667,"Oh, I think they're divine on older women...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"968",4245769,4248168,"but I don't think they'd be right for me.You do understand?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"969",4248271,4249296,"Certainly.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"970",4249405,4253842,"In all fairness, I think I ought to explain.There's also a secondary problem.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"971",4253944,4254932,"One of finance.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"972",4255045,4258412,"We can only afford to spend a limited amount.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"973",4258948,4261782,"- May I ask how limited?- $10.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"974",4263420,4264478,"$10?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"975",4265255,4267314,"That was the outside figure, yes.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"976",4267690,4268658,"I see.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"977",4269292,4271055,"Do you have anything for $10?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"978",4271161,4273185,"Well, frankly, madam, within that price range...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"979",4273296,4276095,"the variety of merchandise is rather limited.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"980",4276198,4279100,"However, I do think we might have, let me see...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"981",4279636,4281899,"Strictly as a novelty, you understand.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"982",4282072,4284768,"For the lady and gentleman who has everything...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"983",4285309,4287743,"a sterling silver telephone dialer...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"984",4288345,4290904,"at $6.75, including tax.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"985",4291014,4293505,"A sterling silver telephone dialer.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"986",4293617,4297609,"Yes, sir. At $6.75, including federal tax.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"987",4297720,4300814,"Well, the price is right, but I must say...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"988",4300923,4304689,"I'd rather hoped for somethingslightly more, how shall I say it...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"989",4305061,4306529,"romantic in feeling.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"990",4307064,4308155,"What do you think?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"991",4308265,4310426,"As sterling silver telephone dialers go...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"992",4310533,4313935,"I certainly think it's handsome,but, well, you do understand?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"993",4315037,4317006,"Well, we tried, but I guess...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"994",4317640,4319939,"We could have something engraved, couldn't we?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"995",4320042,4321408,"Yes, I suppose so.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"996",4321912,4323003,"Yes, indeed.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"997",4323447,4326712,"The only problem is, you would more orless have to buy something first...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"998",4326817,4330719,"if only in order to have some objectupon which to place the engraving.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"999",4331587,4333180,"You see the difficulty.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1000",4333789,4334756,"Well...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1001",4335391,4337326,"We could have this engraved, couldn't we?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1002",4337426,4339292,"I think it would be very smart.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1003",4340930,4344162,"This, I take it, was not purchased at Tiffany's?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1004",4344266,4345234,"No.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1005",4345335,4348064,"Actually, it was purchased concurrent with...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1006",4348171,4350639,"Well, actually, it came inside of...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1007",4352009,4353567,"well, a box of Cracker Jack.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1008",4354144,4355110,"I see.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1009",4356846,4360247,"Do they still really haveprizes in Cracker Jack boxes?","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1010",4360350,4362545,"- Oh, yes.- That's nice to know.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1011",4364421,4366752,"It gives one a feeling of solidarity...","Breakfast at Tiffany's"
"1012",4367490,4370654,"almost of continuity with thepast, that sort of thing.","Breakfast at Tiffany's"

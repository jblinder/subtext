"486",2380320,2382360,"Max knew nothing about love.","Mary and Max"
"487",2382360,2386160,"It was as foreign to him as scuba diving","Mary and Max"
"488",2386160,2390073,"and he'd had an appalling historyof getting it all wrong.","Mary and Max"
"489",2390960,2392560,"One Valentine's Day","Mary and Max"

"493",2410560,2411680,"Romance and love","Mary and Max"
"494",2411680,2414752,"was a mysterious languagehe'd given up on.","Mary and Max"

"496",2418600,2422000,"or asked for an explanationof the Chaos theory.","Mary and Max"
"497",2422000,2426278,"If only there wasa mathematical equation for love.","Mary and Max"
"498",2427840,2431469,"He kept eating and thinking.","Mary and Max"
"499",2445920,2451720,"But love was not like Max'sRubik's Cube. It could not be solved.","Mary and Max"
"500",2451720,2455110,"No matter how he analysed it,the results were negative.","Mary and Max"
"501",2455560,2457320,"Beat it, creep!","Mary and Max"
"502",2457320,2460600,"He felt love but couldn't articulate it.","Mary and Max"

"510",2505960,2509080,"They marinated himin a cocktail of drugs","Mary and Max"
"511",2509080,2512595,"and performedthe usual ""therapeutic"" procedures.","Mary and Max"
"512",2517800,2521280,"Meanwhile, Mary wondered and waited.","Mary and Max"
"513",2522960,2525918,"Maybe Max's typewriterhad run out of ink.","Mary and Max"
"514",2526240,2529630,"Maybe America had run out of ink.","Mary and Max"
"515",2530200,2532509,"Maybe his pets had eaten him.","Mary and Max"
"516",2533760,2535990,"Maybe it was her.","Mary and Max"
"517",2536080,2540471,"Was she too demanding,too boring, too...ugly?","Mary and Max"
"518",2548280,2552068,"Filled with anger, confusionand self-loathing,","Mary and Max"

"520",2604200,2605394,"Max had recovered.","Mary and Max"
"521",2605480,2610110,"And life was balanced, safeand symmetrical once again.","Mary and Max"
"522",2612840,2617160,"But Mary still lingered in his mind.","Mary and Max"

"526",2629040,2631918,"He was a much safer option.","Mary and Max"
"527",2632920,2636674,"He wondered what Mary was doingright now.","Mary and Max"
"528",2637600,2640280,"But she was far from content","Mary and Max"
"529",2640280,2646116,"and struggled on by herself,saving her money for a rainy day.","Mary and Max"
"530",2653320,2655480,"Life went on as usual for Max","Mary and Max"
"531",2655480,2659200,"and even though he optedfor order and stability,","Mary and Max"
"532",2659200,2662510,"misfortune was never far away.","Mary and Max"
"533",2690640,2694480,"Luckily, his manslaughter chargeswere dismissed","Mary and Max"
"534",2694480,2697320,"because he was labelledmentally deficient","Mary and Max"

"536",2701360,2702475,"Oop.","Mary and Max"
"537",2702560,2704039,"..unlike most people.","Mary and Max"
"538",2705800,2709280,"From then on,Max cooled himself differently","Mary and Max"
"539",2709280,2711680,"and things went back to normal","Mary and Max"
"540",2711680,2717400,"until after his 48th birthday,when his numbers finally came up.","Mary and Max"

"560",2879960,2884909,"and seemed more interestedin his self-help books.","Mary and Max"
"561",2885040,2888280,"Mary had given Maxa taste of real friendship","Mary and Max"
"562",2888280,2891636,"and there was just no comparison.","Mary and Max"

"564",2894360,2897158,"but no longer saved to see him.","Mary and Max"
"565",2898320,2902074,"She now savedfor a different reason.","Mary and Max"

"569",2930440,2932360,"not through the eyes,","Mary and Max"

"571",2940040,2942918,"Max understood.","Mary and Max"
"572",2959640,2962400,"Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,","Mary and Max"

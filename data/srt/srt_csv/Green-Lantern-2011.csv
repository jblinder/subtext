"18",175692,176852,"Sorry.","Green Lantern"
"19",177560,181621,"We know from her ring that Ardakian'smurderers were Shadow Demons.","Green Lantern"

"21",185634,188694,"We haven't seen themsince the great crisis.","Green Lantern"
"22",188872,194811,"They came from a rift in our sun, a riftthat connected directly to their universe.","Green Lantern"
"23",194978,197310,"We take it this was no mere anomaly.","Green Lantern"
"24",197479,201211,"No. We were able to makea detailed analysis through the ring.","Green Lantern"
"25",201384,202873,"There's no mistake.","Green Lantern"
"26",203051,206317,"The demons were sent by Krona.","Green Lantern"

"35",236953,240581,"...bringing the Shadow Demonsunder his control.","Green Lantern"
"36",243992,246120,"We sense this is just the beginning...","Green Lantern"

"38",251099,253830,"...as a portal to attack us.","Green Lantern"
"39",254002,258201,"We have sent a squadron of Lanternsto the sun to begin monitoring.","Green Lantern"

"48",289538,293771,"Excuse me, Ganthet, but these precautionsdo seem rather extraordinary.","Green Lantern"
"49",293942,298038,"Krona was a tyrantwith insatiable aggression, Sinestro.","Green Lantern"

"60",336451,339148,"- Are you all right?- Yeah. Sure.","Green Lantern"
"61",339322,342257,"It's just that, well,three days ago I was sitting in class...","Green Lantern"
"62",342425,345917,"...trying to figure out a physics problemand then this.","Green Lantern"
"63",346095,347755,"Yeah, that's the way it is.","Green Lantern"

"65",351800,353098,"A nobody, really.","Green Lantern"
"66",353668,355659,"I'm sure Avra felt the same way.","Green Lantern"

"68",359307,361276,"It's one of the first stories you learn.","Green Lantern"
"69",361444,363377,"I guess we got a little sidetracked.","Green Lantern"
"70",364012,365377,"To quote scripture:","Green Lantern"
"71",365548,369040,"The first one given a ringwas not the first Lantern.","Green Lantern"
"72",369752,372550,"The first was Avra.","Green Lantern"
"73",379961,384057,"The Book of Oa, first chapter, first verse.","Green Lantern"
"74",385067,388264,"Long ago, before our stars had ignited...","Green Lantern"
"75",389305,393502,"... long ago, when life was newand the universe was in its infancy...","Green Lantern"
"76",397747,399577,"... before order...","Green Lantern"
"77",401417,403009,"... there was chaos.","Green Lantern"
"78",416932,419800,"Chaos outbalanced creation...","Green Lantern"
"79",422704,424696,"... hate outbalanced fellowship...","Green Lantern"
"80",430646,432875,"... and all life suffered.","Green Lantern"
"81",440389,442447,"The Guardians saw it all.","Green Lantern"
"82",442625,445752,"The evil was too greatto be left unchecked.","Green Lantern"
"83",446329,448694,"And so they gathered the light.","Green Lantern"
"84",452502,454367,"They knew of its variety and strength...","Green Lantern"
"85",454536,456562,"... and the light with the most power.","Green Lantern"
"86",456738,459468,"But they sought their answerin the light of will...","Green Lantern"
"87",462879,466406,"... to form from it a weapon unequalled...","Green Lantern"
"88",467082,468572,"... to turn armies to sand.","Green Lantern"
"89",469185,471949,"Will, given substance...","Green Lantern"
"90",472588,474249,"... forming.","Green Lantern"
"91",475557,477957,"The greatest warriors of the universewere gathered.","Green Lantern"
"92",478728,480821,"Four would be chosen.","Green Lantern"
"93",480997,482555,"The first four.","Green Lantern"
"94",482732,485666,"An event to be recordedand remembered.","Green Lantern"
"95",486401,488165,"And the Guardian said to the assembly:","Green Lantern"
"96",488336,490327,"Stand tall, warriors.","Green Lantern"
"97",490505,495170,"If we are to be Guardians,you are to be our strength.","Green Lantern"
"98",495343,500007,"If you are to be our strength,these shall be your arms.","Green Lantern"
"99",553836,556326,"But then, the unexpected.","Green Lantern"
"100",556504,558836,"They called it an accident.","Green Lantern"
"101",559008,562636,"Accident is only the will of the universeexpressing itself.","Green Lantern"
"102",563846,568509,"And it was the universe's willthat the fourth Lantern be Avra...","Green Lantern"
"103",568951,570384,"... a mere scribe...","Green Lantern"
"104",570552,573147,"... chronicler to the Guardians.","Green Lantern"
"105",574056,579653,"And so it would be for all time,the rings would choose their successors.","Green Lantern"
"106",581730,585724,"The Guardians had armed the first four,and sought to train them.","Green Lantern"
"107",588336,591500,"Though no training could prepare themfor what would come...","Green Lantern"
"108",591673,593835,"... when training gave way to duty.","Green Lantern"
"109",597779,600179,"A plague had savaged the universe.","Green Lantern"
"110",611027,614690,"The Guardians dispatched the first fourto stop its advance.","Green Lantern"
"111",614864,616354,"Ready or not.","Green Lantern"
"112",623538,624596,"Your first battle?","Green Lantern"
"113",626375,629366,"Just do what I do. And try to stay alive.","Green Lantern"
"114",629812,632371,"Are these really enoughto stand against all that?","Green Lantern"
"115",634216,636308,"The Guardians say they'll protect us.","Green Lantern"
"116",636485,638043,"But they're just rings.","Green Lantern"
"117",638520,641649,"And before getting yoursyou were just a scribe.","Green Lantern"
"118",641823,643222,"Use your imagination.","Green Lantern"
"119",729211,730735,"It was too much for them.","Green Lantern"
"120",731679,733238,"For anyone.","Green Lantern"
"121",784066,786296,"These rings are useless.","Green Lantern"
"122",786469,788369,"We might as well be wearing trinkets.","Green Lantern"
"123",788537,789730,"What do we do?","Green Lantern"
"124",789904,793807,"We have only two options:Retreat or death.","Green Lantern"
"125",793975,795966,"There is no victory here.","Green Lantern"
"126",797046,798604,"Retreat it is, then.","Green Lantern"
"127",798780,801375,"Go. I'll cover your escape.","Green Lantern"
"128",804119,805950,"And the first Lantern saw...","Green Lantern"
"129",806621,808054,"... and would not run.","Green Lantern"
"130",808224,809782,"Wait.","Green Lantern"
"131",809958,812860,"The Guardians forged these ringsfrom will.","Green Lantern"
"132",813028,815052,"Will can do more than pave our retreat.","Green Lantern"
"133",815230,818325,"Will is the first cause behind any action.","Green Lantern"
"134",818500,821402,"We must will our survival.","Green Lantern"
"135",821570,824299,"You're commended for your faithin the Guardians, Avra...","Green Lantern"
"136",824472,826634,"...but this is a failed endeavor.","Green Lantern"
"137",827209,828801,"You'll die.","Green Lantern"
"138",831580,832807,"So be it.","Green Lantern"
"139",832981,835974,"I choose to believe in the Guardians.","Green Lantern"
"140",836885,839217,"This is battle, Avra. It's real.","Green Lantern"

"151",994909,997605,"In time, the first of the ringswould be passed on...","Green Lantern"
"152",998447,1000607,"... while a hundred more were forged...","Green Lantern"

"154",1002918,1004851,"... thousands.","Green Lantern"
"155",1006654,1009817,"All would be taughtas the first Lantern had learned.","Green Lantern"
"156",1010491,1012755,"A new path to victory.","Green Lantern"
"157",1013162,1016995,"A use for the ringthat even the Guardians had not predicted.","Green Lantern"
"158",1031613,1034844,"In time, old Lanterns would fall...","Green Lantern"
"159",1035017,1038111,"... their rings given to the new,to learn as they did.","Green Lantern"
"160",1038554,1040077,"Even Avra would fall...","Green Lantern"

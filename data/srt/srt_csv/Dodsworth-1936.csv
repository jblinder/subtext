"497",1935483,1939613,"This Arnold Iselin may be all he sayshe is internationally and financially...","Dodsworth"
"498",1939687,1942884,"but he certainlyis no Barney Baruch.","Dodsworth"
"499",1942957,1945050,"That Mrs. De Penable,I suppose she's all right...","Dodsworth"
"500",1945126,1948527,"if you don't mind your friend collectingcommission on the dresses you buy.","Dodsworth"
"501",1948596,1953590,"I hate to think who pays the billwhen that young Austrian takes you out.","Dodsworth"
"502",1953668,1958264,"Arnold Iselin happens to be oneof the most famous living financiers...","Dodsworth"
"503",1958339,1960307,"and a distinguished art collector.","Dodsworth"

"509",1980194,1981593,"What else are we?","Dodsworth"
"510",1981663,1983688,"I'm just an ordinaryAmerican businessman...","Dodsworth"
"511",1983765,1987462,"and I married the daughter of a Zenithbrewer who's flying high these days.","Dodsworth"
"512",1987535,1989503,"I suppose you knowwhat you mean by that.","Dodsworth"
"513",1989570,1992198,"- Why won't you sit at a cafe with me?- Smart people don't.","Dodsworth"

"516",1995510,1998172,"It's self-respect, like the Englishmandressing for dinner in the jungle.","Dodsworth"
"517",1998246,2000237,"I read about him.He probably never did it.","Dodsworth"
"518",2000314,2002441,"- You simply will not understand.- I can't!","Dodsworth"
"519",2002517,2004951,"If I want men to besomething more than waiters!","Dodsworth"

"524",2018099,2020533,"- How you been apologizing for me?- Yes, I have!","Dodsworth"
"525",2031946,2033880,"Hello? Yes?","Dodsworth"

"530",2048529,2051362,"You're hopeless. You haven't themistiest notion of civilization here.","Dodsworth"
"531",2051432,2053366,"Maybe I don't thinkso much of it though.","Dodsworth"
"532",2053434,2055493,"Maybe clean hospitals,concrete highways...","Dodsworth"
"533",2055570,2060030,"and no soldiers on the Canadian bordercome nearer my idea of civilization.","Dodsworth"
"534",2060108,2062076,"There are 20 million automobilesin America.","Dodsworth"
"535",2062143,2065738,"I've contributed something to every oneof them from my own civilization.","Dodsworth"
"536",2065813,2069010,"If that isn't more than knowing how toorder dinner as your friend the madam...","Dodsworth"
"537",2069083,2071449,"- Don't call her ""the madam"" either.- All right.","Dodsworth"
"538",2071519,2074181,"- Don't let's go into that again.- You don't want to learn.","Dodsworth"
"539",2074255,2076553,"I could teach you.I belong here.","Dodsworth"
"540",2076624,2078956,"- They accept me here.- Yeah?","Dodsworth"

"1184",4981893,4984623,"Perhaps it's not my placeto bring it up...","Dodsworth"
"1185",4984696,4987563,"but it is an argument,so you'll let me use it.","Dodsworth"
"1186",4987632,4990100,"I'm a person of considerable meansin my own right.","Dodsworth"
"1187",4990168,4992602,"Enough for the three of us.So you see...","Dodsworth"

"1189",4995540,4998668,"I do not deny that we are poorsince the war...","Dodsworth"
"1190",4998743,5002839,"and your influence and moneywould be most helpful...","Dodsworth"

"1205",5056434,5059403,"So why shouldn't we marry anywayand take our happiness?","Dodsworth"
"1206",5059471,5062634,"I do not knowwhat power you have over Kurt...","Dodsworth"
"1207",5062707,5067303,"but I should thinkof my own happiness if I were you.","Dodsworth"
"1208",5067378,5069312,"I am thinking of that.","Dodsworth"
"1209",5074953,5076716,"Have you thought...","Dodsworth"
"1210",5076788,5080053,"how little happiness there can be...","Dodsworth"
"1211",5080125,5081752,"for the...","Dodsworth"

"1222",5152397,5153989,"Please don't be angry.","Dodsworth"
"1223",5154065,5156829,"Perhaps we had better postponeour marriage for a year...","Dodsworth"
"1224",5156901,5158493,"until we win her over.","Dodsworth"
"1225",5158570,5160595,"What are you?","Dodsworth"

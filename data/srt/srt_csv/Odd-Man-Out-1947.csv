"723",4421375,4424165,"Child, you mustn't say such things.","Odd Man Out"
"724",4425291,4428790,"Why, Father?The law would do it for revenge.","Odd Man Out"

"1009",5949333,5955249,"From your experience of men andwomen, would you say they're all bad?","Odd Man Out"
"1010",5955291,5958415,"In my profession,there is neither good nor bad.","Odd Man Out"
"1011",5958458,5961415,"There is innocence and guilt, that's all.","Odd Man Out"

"255",1390727,1393063,"He bit me. Look here.","The Wolf Man"
"256",1403272,1404941,"Well...","The Wolf Man"
"257",1405041,1407443,"that's funny.","The Wolf Man"
"258",1407543,1409979,"It must have healed up.","The Wolf Man"
"259",1410613,1413182,"Larry, Paul wants to ask yousome questions.","The Wolf Man"
"260",1413282,1416285,"- Why, sure. Go ahead.- No, we ought to leave him alone.","The Wolf Man"
"261",1416418,1420289,"What's the matter with you?Paul wants to question him. Go ahead.","The Wolf Man"
"262",1420356,1425694,"Yeah, but don't try to make me believeI killed a man when I know I killed a wolf.","The Wolf Man"
"263",1425794,1429431,"Yes, yes. We're all a little bit confused.","The Wolf Man"
"264",1430532,1432501,"He needs a good rest.","The Wolf Man"
"265",1432567,1435771,"We'll talk to you later, Larry.Come on, Doctor.","The Wolf Man"

"269",1448983,1451653,"But they're treating me like I was crazy!","The Wolf Man"
"270",1453187,1458192,"I'm not accusing him of foul play, but twopeople are dead and I am chief constable.","The Wolf Man"
"271",1458292,1461963,"No reason to make a mystery out of it.You talk like a detective in a novel.","The Wolf Man"
"272",1462029,1464765,"Please, gentlemen,there's a simple explanation.","The Wolf Man"
"273",1464865,1467501,"A dog or a wolf attacked Jenny Williams.","The Wolf Man"
"274",1467568,1470337,"She cried for help,Larry and Bela went to her rescue.","The Wolf Man"
"275",1470404,1474408,"It was dark. Excitement and confusion,the Gypsy was killed.","The Wolf Man"
"276",1474475,1478245,"- What about Bela's bare feet?- He didn't have time to put his shoes on.","The Wolf Man"
"277",1478312,1481315,"- This nonexistent wound?- Larry imagined he was bitten.","The Wolf Man"
"278",1481415,1485519,"- The beast tore his coat to shreds.- Still he insists he received a wound.","The Wolf Man"
"279",1485619,1490190,"You tell me his coat was bloody.Surely a wound can't heal overnight.","The Wolf Man"
"280",1490290,1493526,"The patient is mentally disturbed.Perhaps the shock did it.","The Wolf Man"
"281",1493626,1496763,"I'd rather you didn't bother himwith questions just now.","The Wolf Man"
"282",1496863,1501534,"You policemen, always in such a hurry.As if dead men hadn't all eternity.","The Wolf Man"
"283",1501601,1504270,"You'll be declaring me a mental case next.","The Wolf Man"
"284",1504370,1506973,"Oh, no, I wouldn't dare.","The Wolf Man"
"285",1507073,1511243,"Thank you. In return, I won't questionyour patient again until you think fit.","The Wolf Man"
"286",1511310,1512578,"Thank you.","The Wolf Man"
"287",1540905,1544642,"- It's the Gypsy fortune-teller.- And the man that killed him.","The Wolf Man"
"288",1614076,1618347,"(man) My dear woman, we can'tbury this man without prayer.","The Wolf Man"
"289",1618414,1625020,"There is nothing to pray for, sir. Belahas entered a much better world than this.","The Wolf Man"
"290",1625120,1628857,"At least so you ministers always say, sir.","The Wolf Man"
"291",1628991,1633328,"And so it is. But that's no reasonto hold a pagan celebration.","The Wolf Man"
"292",1633395,1638366,"I hear your people are coming to towndancing and singing and making merry.","The Wolf Man"
"293",1638433,1643705,"For a thousand years we Gypsieshave buried our dead like that.","The Wolf Man"
"294",1643772,1646941,"I couldn't break the custom,even if I wanted to.","The Wolf Man"
"295",1647942,1652613,"Fighting against superstition isas hard as fighting against Satan himself.","The Wolf Man"
"296",1668696,1671865,"The way you walked was thorny,","The Wolf Man"
"297",1671932,1674435,"through no fault of your own.","The Wolf Man"
"298",1675102,1678872,"But as the rain enters the soil,","The Wolf Man"
"299",1678939,1682743,"the river enters the sea,","The Wolf Man"
"300",1682809,1687180,"so tears run to a predestined end.","The Wolf Man"
"301",1688548,1692852,"Your suffering is over, Bela, my son.","The Wolf Man"
"302",1694387,1697023,"Now you will find peace.","The Wolf Man"
"303",1732324,1735060,"But, my dear, there's nothingthey can accuse you of.","The Wolf Man"
"304",1735160,1738897,"Now, here, why don't you go upto your room and lie down?","The Wolf Man"
"305",1738964,1741199,"I don't want to be alone, Father.","The Wolf Man"
"306",1741266,1743968,"As soon as I close my eyes, I see Jenny.","The Wolf Man"
"307",1745804,1747906,"I'd rather stay here.","The Wolf Man"
"308",1753011,1755546,"Why, of course, my dear. Of course.","The Wolf Man"
"309",1765489,1767892,"- Ladies, what can I do for you?- Where is she?","The Wolf Man"
"310",1767925,1771261,"- What do you want to know?- Why she left my Jenny with the Gypsy.","The Wolf Man"
"311",1771395,1774364,"She didn't want to be therewhile the fortune was told.","The Wolf Man"
"312",1774465,1777067,"What a lie. She justwanted to walk out in the...","The Wolf Man"
"313",1777100,1782406,"- You mustn't speak of my Gwen like that!- Listen. There's a fine father for you.","The Wolf Man"
"314",1782472,1785776,"How dare you let her walk outwith other men when she's engaged?","The Wolf Man"
"315",1785842,1789813,"- She didn't do anything wrong.- It's because of her my Jenny was killed.","The Wolf Man"
"316",1789879,1792048,"- Now, that's enough!- She's to blame.","The Wolf Man"
"317",1792148,1795852,"- I knew that innocent face was just...- Outside! Outside, all of you!","The Wolf Man"
"318",1795919,1801391,"I want the truth. What was she doing whilemy little Jenny was being murdered?","The Wolf Man"
"319",1801491,1805027,"- I'll tell you what she was doing!- All right, tell me!","The Wolf Man"
"320",1805862,1808431,"Come on, come on.Speak up. What was it?","The Wolf Man"
"321",1809732,1812935,"Don't you dare touch me.You and your fine daughter.","The Wolf Man"
"322",1813002,1815571,"You've not heard the last of this!","The Wolf Man"
"323",1823612,1826715,"- What's gotten into them?- I really don't know.","The Wolf Man"
"324",1827883,1832754,"I'm sorry, sir, about getting Gwen into thismess, but there wasn't anything wrong.","The Wolf Man"
"325",1832854,1835023,"I trust my daughter, sir.","The Wolf Man"
"326",1836091,1838860,"I hope that she didn't hear all this row.","The Wolf Man"
"327",1838927,1841863,"- Tell me, is she in?- Yes, she's in the parlour.","The Wolf Man"

"334",1864151,1866053,"Kind of a mess, isn't it?","The Wolf Man"
"335",1866153,1869256,"I came over to tell youhow sorry I am about Jenny.","The Wolf Man"

"338",1877965,1883303,"In the fight it bit me. This morningthere's no sign of the wound.","The Wolf Man"
"339",1883403,1888508,"Now they're trying to make me believethat I killed Bela the fortune-teller.","The Wolf Man"
"340",1888608,1891678,"Well, maybe there wasn't a wolf.","The Wolf Man"
"341",1891778,1894147,"It was dark and foggy and, well,","The Wolf Man"
"342",1894214,1898251,"perhaps the story I told youabout the werewolf confused you.","The Wolf Man"
"343",1898351,1901220,"Why does everyone insistthat I'm confused?","The Wolf Man"

"468",2851271,2854074,"- That's all Greek to me.- Well, it is Greek.","The Wolf Man"
"469",2854141,2857377,"It's a technical expressionfor something very simple.","The Wolf Man"

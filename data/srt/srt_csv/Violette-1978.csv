"739",5222333,5223630,"Against your father?","Violette"
"740",5223701,5224998,"My father, yes.","Violette"
"741",5228706,5230367,"It was an obsession.","Violette"

"744",5238115,5241380,"Never against my mother,even in March.","Violette"
"745",5241786,5243981,"You tried to do away with her?","Violette"
"746",5248192,5250092,"I was afraid she'd interfere.","Violette"
"747",5253064,5254861,"That she'd stop me killing him.","Violette"
"748",5254932,5257196,"Was he too authoritative?","Violette"
"749",5257268,5258394,"Is that it?","Violette"
"750",5262840,5264432,"Well yes, that's it.","Violette"

"864",6183525,6185516,"She can say what she likes.","Violette"
"865",6185593,6189359,"She tried to poison them twice,","Violette"
"866",6189431,6191296,"and twice, they took it.","Violette"
"867",6191366,6194927,"In a way, it's as if they wanted to die.","Violette"
"868",6195870,6199169,"Violette is right!It's the family that's on trial!","Violette"
"869",6199240,6202266,"She has untied the awful serpent's knotof blood ties!","Violette"

"885",6282190,6283589,"What's wrong?","Violette"
"886",6287395,6289920,"I dreamt that I was poisoningmy mother's spirit.","Violette"
"887",6289998,6292330,"When she was young, I would tell her,","Violette"
"888",6292400,6296097,"if ever a situation occurs where a man isbothering you, tell your mother right away.","Violette"
"889",6296170,6299196,"This is quite a different type of situation.","Violette"
"890",6301009,6303944,"Have you ever envied your daughter?","Violette"
"891",6304012,6306446,"No, I've never been envious of anyone.","Violette"

"893",6315690,6318818,"all the evil she'd saidabout my husband,","Violette"
"894",6318893,6322886,"I decided to live to clear himof these ignominies.","Violette"
"895",6323565,6324930,"To live to avenge him.","Violette"
"896",6330371,6334467,"I've decided to prosecute my daughter.","Violette"
"897",6340381,6341370,"Violette.","Violette"

"899",6377352,6378341,"Yes.","Violette"
"900",6378686,6379675,"Why?","Violette"
"901",6385026,6386891,"I don't know why.","Violette"
"902",6386992,6391019,"I saw right away that this was someoneperverse, with a distorted perception.","Violette"
"903",6391764,6395996,"Her insensitivity wouldmanifest itself in terrible ways.","Violette"
"904",6397202,6398362,"She lied all the time.","Violette"
"905",6398437,6402168,"But sometimes staying closeto the truth. Horrible lies.","Violette"
"906",6403409,6406901,"She even createdan imaginary sister.","Violette"
"907",6408680,6411444,"As if a sister of minewould ever go out with her.","Violette"
"908",6411517,6412745,"You would've been ashamed.","Violette"
"909",6412885,6414011,"Yes.","Violette"
"910",6414253,6417154,"Money... you shouldn'thave gotten a taste for it.","Violette"
"911",6418123,6420853,"You know they hate it when we touchtheir dear savings.","Violette"
"912",6423228,6424559,"I have no regrets.","Violette"
"913",6430602,6433537,"Everything I did to my fatherand mother...","Violette"
"914",6434773,6436502,"It has cut off my desire.","Violette"
"915",6442748,6444978,"I have never loved like that before.","Violette"
"916",6445050,6447018,"Now I love no one.","Violette"
"917",6448754,6450278,"It's better for you.","Violette"
"918",6452357,6453790,"Do you think I'll be convicted?","Violette"
"919",6453859,6457522,"She said she wasin the business of fashion.","Violette"
"920",6457963,6459988,"I don't think she ever left Paris.","Violette"
"921",6460065,6463398,"Once she took us to the parkwith a bottle of champagne","Violette"
"922",6463802,6465929,"to celebrate her leaving for vacation.","Violette"
"923",6467406,6469465,"Except, she never went.","Violette"
"924",6469541,6471702,"She was always with younger people","Violette"
"925",6472911,6476312,"who would say they were studentsbut were not.","Violette"
"926",6476381,6478246,"And with whom I never likedto associate myself.","Violette"
"927",6478317,6481184,"I am happy to hear you say that.","Violette"
"928",6481253,6482515,"Thank you.","Violette"
"929",6483322,6485085,"I don't even care about my defense.","Violette"
"930",6486792,6488851,"Then you may be acquitted.","Violette"
"931",6488927,6490895,"Judges like martyrs.","Violette"
"932",6493665,6496634,"The crowd is mad.We can't get her to court.","Violette"
"933",6496702,6499830,"But of course, of course.","Violette"
"934",6500572,6502699,"My office has been used before.","Violette"
"935",6506712,6509180,"A prison always has a history.","Violette"

"943",6586658,6589286,"My father wanting all the time to...","Violette"
"944",6590963,6592487,"I wanted to die.","Violette"
"945",6592564,6593656,"What about your parents?","Violette"
"946",6594199,6595928,"I wanted us all to die.","Violette"
"947",6596468,6599301,"I wanted to end this long, troubled past.","Violette"
"948",6600005,6601165,"What do you mean?","Violette"
"949",6603375,6604535,"I can't say.","Violette"

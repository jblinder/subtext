"203",1136759,1141359,"Make no mistake, my brothers.They will draw first blood.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"204",1141460,1144460,"They will force their cure upon us.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"205",1145759,1150160,"The only question is,will you join my brotherhood and fight?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"206",1150359,1153559,"Or wait for the inevitable genocide?","X-Men: The Last Stand"

"272",1716660,1718859,"Logan!","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"273",1724259,1726559,"She's alive.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"274",1730559,1733160,"Jean.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"275",1735559,1740960,"The sheer mass of water that collapsedon top of Jean should have obliterated her.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"276",1741059,1743259,"The only explanation of Jean's survival","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"277",1743359,1749160,"is that her powers wrapped herin a cocoon of telekinetic energy.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"278",1750460,1751960,"Is she gonna be OK?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"279",1752059,1757759,"Jean Grey is the only class five mutantI've ever encountered, her potential limitless.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"280",1757859,1762559,"Her mutation is seated in the unconsciouspart of her mind and therein lay the danger.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"281",1762660,1767160,"When she was a girl,I created a series of psychic barriers","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"282",1767259,1769859,"to isolate her powersfrom her conscious mind.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"283",1769960,1775960,"- Jean developed a dual personality.- What?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"284",1776160,1782059,"The conscious Jean, whose powers werealways in her control, and the dormant side.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"285",1782160,1788259,"A personality that, in our sessions,came to call itself the Phoenix.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"286",1788759,1794660,"A purely instinctual creature,all desire and joy and rage.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"287",1796059,1800059,"- She knew all this?- It's unclear how much she knew.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"288",1800160,1805359,"Far more critical is whether the womanin front of us is the Jean Grey we know,","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"289",1805559,1808960,"or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"290",1809059,1811960,"- She looks peaceful to me.- I'm keeping her that way.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"291",1812160,1817660,"I'm trying to restore the psychic blocksand cage the beast again.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"292",1817759,1820059,"What have you done to her?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"293",1820160,1823660,"- You have to understand...- You're talking about a person's mind.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"294",1823859,1826859,"- She has to be controlled.- Controlled?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"295",1826960,1830359,"Sometimes, when you cage the beast,the beast gets angry.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"296",1830559,1834660,"You have no idea.You have no idea of what she is capable.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"297",1834759,1837759,"No, Professor.I had no idea what you were capable of.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"298",1837859,1841660,"I had a terrible choice to make.I chose the lesser of two evils.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"299",1841759,1845660,"It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"300",1845759,1850059,"I don't have to explain myself,least of all to you.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"301",1858259,1860759,"History will be made here today.For the first time,","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"302",1860859,1864259,"the so-called mutant curewill be available to the public.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"303",1864359,1867660,"Reaction has run the gamutwith mutants on both sides of the line.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"304",1867759,1873960,"Some are desperate for this cure while othersare offended by the very idea of it.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"305",1887259,1889359,"Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"306",1889460,1894660,"Hard to say. His political views seemsomewhat at odds with his personal issues.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"307",1894759,1897759,"Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"308",1898660,1900460,"Good. Bring him in.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"309",1900559,1902759,"Are you sure you want to start with him?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"310",1902859,1905359,"I think it's important. Yes.","X-Men: The Last Stand"

"315",1920960,1923059,"You ready?","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"316",1951460,1955259,"The transformation can be a little jarring.","X-Men: The Last Stand"

"318",1963160,1965059,"It'll all be over soon.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"319",1966359,1972059,"- Everything's going to be fine.- Wait. I can't do this.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"320",1972160,1974059,"Warren, calm down.","X-Men: The Last Stand"

"523",3497659,3501260,"Xavier started this school.Perhaps it's best that it end with him.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"524",3501360,3507260,"- We'll tell the students they're going home.- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.","X-Men: The Last Stand"
"525",3507360,3513159,"I can't believe this. I can't believewe're not going to fight for this school.","X-Men: The Last Stand"

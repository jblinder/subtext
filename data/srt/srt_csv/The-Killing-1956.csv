"267",1012679,1015639,"I've given you sufficient proof of that.","The Killing"
"268",1015723,1018266,"Well, I know.It's just that lately every time I call -","The Killing"
"269",1018351,1020102,"So I step out once in a while.","The Killing"
"270",1020186,1023438,"Look, you got yourself a husband,a guy who'll spend every last nickel on you...","The Killing"

an afternoon movie at 9:00 at night.","The Killing"

"273",1030947,1033949,"If that's being greedy, then I'm the biggestglutton that ever walked the Earth.","The Killing"
"274",1034033,1037160,"Don't make it sound so ominous.It's not like you're gonna eat me alive.","The Killing"
"275",1037245,1039204,"I may just do that.","The Killing"
"276",1042583,1046253,"Darling, what are the two things in lifeyou're most interested in?","The Killing"
"277",1046337,1048296,"- What?- Money and women?","The Killing"
"278",1048381,1050382,"Oh. That's a nice way to put me down.","The Killing"
"279",1050466,1053635,"- That about sums it up, doesn't it?- We'll let it stand.","The Killing"
"280",1053720,1057139,"But I imagine what you really meant to saywas ""money and woman.""","The Killing"
"281",1057223,1059808,"We're gonna have money, Val,more money than you ever dreamed of.","The Killing"
"282",1059892,1062519,"- Maybe even millions.- Oh, yeah? How?","The Killing"
"283",1062603,1066106,"George. That's how.He's stumbled onto somethin' big.","The Killing"
"284",1066190,1069151,"- That meatball?- A meatball with gravy, Val.","The Killing"
"285",1069235,1070944,"You know he works at the track.","The Killing"
"286",1071028,1074281,"Well, somehow - and don't ask me how -but he's got connected with a mob.","The Killing"
"287",1074365,1077701,"They're gonna rob the track officesfor the day's receipts.","The Killing"
"288",1077785,1081163,"You mean he seriously told youthat he and some mob are gonna
knock over the racetrack?","The Killing"
"289",1081247,1085083,"And you can believe him, Val, 'cause Georgemay be a fool, but he's not a liar.","The Killing"
"290",1085168,1087419,"The guy's crazy.That's never been done before.","The Killing"
"291",1087503,1091423,"I know. I told him that, but he says the job'sall set up, and it's gonna be done.","The Killing"
"292",1091507,1095093,"And if I just sit tight, I'd be upto my curls in cash, just like that.","The Killing"
"293",1096763,1101475,"Well, let's suppose this is all true.How do I fit in?","The Killing"
"294",1101559,1105020,"Well, you know I've been gonna leave George.I guess you know why too.","The Killing"
"295",1105104,1108106,"Well, you've been saying thatfor a long, long time, Sherry.","The Killing"
"296",1109776,1112486,"But everything's changed now.I was gonna tell him tonight.","The Killing"
"297",1112570,1115322,"- George may be very rich very soon.","The Killing"
"298",1115406,1117073,"That's all he needs, isn't it?","The Killing"
"299",1117158,1119201,"He'd still be George.","The Killing"
"300",1119285,1125207,"So you think, uh, let's say George and his boyspull this job, and George gets his cut.","The Killing"
"301",1125291,1127667,"Maybe I could take it away from him, huh?","The Killing"
"302",1127752,1129753,"I think you could.","The Killing"
"303",1131297,1133381,"What about the others?You got any idea who they are?","The Killing"
"304",1133466,1136968,"Only this. I went through his clotheswhile he was showering.","The Killing"
"305",1137053,1139846,"I'm quite sure George went there tonight.","The Killing"
"306",1139931,1141890,"Hmm.","The Killing"
"307",1141974,1144893,"Kiddo, I think we got somethin' here.","The Killing"
"308",1144977,1148021,"You know, if this is true,this is a lot bigger than you think.","The Killing"
"309",1148105,1150774,"You're interested in taking Georgie's cut?Well, I got news for you.","The Killing"
"310",1150858,1153860,"Georgie's cut's gonna be peanutscompared to this whole thing.","The Killing"
"311",1153945,1156655,"We gotta find out moreabout the overall plan.","The Killing"
"312",1156739,1158949,"- You think he'd tell you any more?- Not a chance.","The Killing"
"313",1159033,1162244,"I could see he was scared stiff'cause he talked as much as he did.","The Killing"
"314",1162328,1165539,"I don't get it, Johnny -about these two other guys.","The Killing"
"315",1167834,1172003,"You mean there's gonna betwo other guys in on the deal,
and we ain't gonna know who they are?","The Killing"
"316",1172088,1175215,"That's right. You don't know who they are,and they don't know who you are.","The Killing"
"317",1175299,1178385,"- That makes sense to you, doesn't it?- Yes, I guess so, but -","The Killing"
"318",1178511,1182472,"It makes sense to me, all right.How come we need 'em, though, Johnny?
What are they gonna do?","The Killing"
"319",1182557,1184558,"Well, one of them'sfor the job with the rifle.","The Killing"
"320",1184642,1187102,"None of you boys can handle that,even if you were willing to.","The Killing"
"321",1187186,1188812,"And the other onestarts the fight in the bar.","The Killing"
"322",1188896,1191523,"These other fellas - how muchare they cuttin' in for? Not that I mind.","The Killing"
"323",1191607,1193275,"Anything you do is okay, but -","The Killing"
"324",1193359,1195193,"These men are not gonna bein on the basic scheme.","The Killing"
"325",1195278,1198655,"They're getting paid to perform certaindefinite duties at a certain definite time.","The Killing"
"326",1198739,1200782,"And they're not cutting in on the take.","The Killing"
"327",1200867,1203118,"They'll be paid a flat priceto do a straight job.","The Killing"
"328",1203202,1206997,"Well, if they don't know anythingabout the basic plan, about the job,
then why are they doin' it?","The Killing"
"329",1207081,1209457,"It's simple. These boys are straight hoods.They get paid in advance.","The Killing"
"330",1209542,1211835,"Five grand for the one with the rifle,and 2,500 for the other.","The Killing"
"331",1211919,1215380,"- Where's this money comin' from?- That's where Marvin comes in.","The Killing"
"332",1215464,1218967,"He's getting the 7,500 for us,and he gets it back off the top.","The Killing"
"333",1219051,1221303,"I wish I could do more, Johnny.","The Killing"
"334",1221387,1223763,"It's almost not right for meto get as much as everybody else.","The Killing"
"335",1223848,1226975,"- After all, all I do is -- Your money counts for plenty, Marv.","The Killing"
"336",1227059,1229060,"You don't hear any of themcomplaining, do you?","The Killing"
"337",1229145,1232022,"Sure. You're okay in our book, Marv.But look, Johnny.","The Killing"
"338",1232106,1235775,"If these two hoods get paid in advance, howdo you know they're gonna do their jobs?","The Killing"
"339",1235860,1238528,"I'll vouch for 'em. These guys are pros.","The Killing"
"340",1238613,1242115,"They can't afford to weasel out on a deal.If they did, they'd be washed up. Okay?","The Killing"
"341",1242199,1244200,"- Okay.- Any other questions?","The Killing"
"342",1245912,1248330,"Well, let's take a look at this then.","The Killing"
"343",1248414,1252834,"This is a rough drawing of the trackas I remember it.","The Killing"
"344",1252919,1256421,"Randy, you'll have to get mean A-1 street map of the whole district.","The Killing"
"345",1256505,1260634,"George, Mike, I want youto go over this thing with me inch by inch.","The Killing"
"346",1260718,1264012,"Bring it completely up to date,add or subtract the slightest change...","The Killing"
"347",1264096,1267724,"even if it's something as smallas the placement of a hot dog stand.","The Killing"
"348",1267808,1270477,"Now, give or take a few thousand...","The Killing"
"349",1270561,1273688,"I figure the loot on this dealat two million.","The Killing"
"350",1275149,1277359,"There should be that muchin the track offices.","The Killing"
"351",1277443,1279778,"That includes profitson the parimutuel betting...","The Killing"
"352",1279862,1282739,"the breakage money,taxes from the mutuel machines...","The Killing"
"353",1282823,1286534,"receipts from the concessionsand the money from ticket sales.","The Killing"
"354",1286619,1290163,"None of this money is allowed to accumulateat any one point around the track.","The Killing"
"355",1290247,1292874,"Except for money to make change withand the mutuel clerk's payoff money...","The Killing"
"356",1292959,1295210,"why, it all goes into the office.","The Killing"
"357",1295294,1298004,"And out of the entire take,only a few thousand dollars...","The Killing"
"358",1298089,1300548,"is put in the office safeto cover emergencies.","The Killing"
"359",1300633,1303885,"The rest is out in the open,held for pickup by armored car.","The Killing"
"360",1303970,1306137,"That car arrives about 5:00...","The Killing"
"361",1306222,1309057,"and parks directly in frontof the main entrance to the clubhouse.","The Killing"
"362",1309141,1312769,"Two men stay in it - one at the wheel,and the other at a machine gun in the turret.","The Killing"
"363",1312853,1314854,"Two others enter the officeto collect the dough.","The Killing"
"364",1314981,1319067,"Now, they're armed, of course, and so arethe track detectives who cover them
from the car to the office and back.","The Killing"
"365",1319151,1321778,"Now, once the armored car arrives,a, uh, stickup is -","The Killing"
"366",1321862,1325115,"- Is out of the question.","The Killing"
"367",1351017,1354978,"Say, now, what in the name of Petewould a babe be doing outside that door?","The Killing"
"368",1355062,1357772,"Uh, what do you think?","The Killing"
"369",1357857,1359941,"You guys, any of you eversee this woman before?","The Killing"
"370",1360026,1362485,"- It's Sherry, my wife.- Why, you -","The Killing"
"371",1362570,1364571,"You been talkin'.Now you spilled to her.","The Killing"
"372",1364655,1367198,"I did not. What, do you think I'm crazy?I wouldn't -","The Killing"
"373",1367283,1368950,"You jerk! You clown!","The Killing"
"374",1369035,1370952,"Come on, clown.Sing us a chorus from Pagliacci.","The Killing"
"375",1371037,1374289,"You better talk, George. Come clean.Either you talk, or we'll get it out of her.","The Killing"
"376",1374373,1376541,"Please, you wouldn't do anythingto her, Johnny? Please.","The Killing"
"377",1376625,1379461,"I don't wanna, but if you won't talk,if you won't tell us what you told her -","The Killing"
"378",1379545,1383256,"I didn't tell her nothin'! Honest, I didn't.Why would I do a thing like that, Johnny?","The Killing"
"379",1383340,1386468,"Sure, she wouldn't.She's just a building inspector, isn't she?","The Killing"
"380",1386552,1389345,"Just stopped outside that doorto measure the keyhole. Why, you -","The Killing"
"381",1389430,1391931,"Let's have it, George.We're gonna get it out of one of ya.","The Killing"
"382",1392016,1394684,"If you didn't tell her,then why was she around here snoopin'?","The Killing"
"383",1394769,1398229,"Oh! She must have found the addressin my pocket.","The Killing"
"384",1398314,1400523,"Sure. That's what it was.Thought I was two-timing her.","The Killing"
"385",1400608,1403234,"You know, runnin' around with another -","The Killing"
"386",1403319,1406738,"Of course.She's just checkin' up on me, John.","The Killing"
"387",1410743,1413203,"I didn't tell her nothin'.Honest, I didn't.","The Killing"
"388",1413287,1417290,"You'll let her go, won't you?You won't hurt her, John?","The Killing"
"389",1417416,1421211,"Randy? Mike?Take him home to his apartment
and stick with him until I phone you.","The Killing"
"390",1421295,1424464,"- No, I'm not leaving Sherry!- You're leavin', all right.","The Killing"
"391",1424548,1427008,"Now, how are you goin' -slidin' or walkin'?","The Killing"
"392",1427093,1429094,"Come on, George, let's go.","The Killing"
"393",1432348,1434349,"What are you gonna do now, Johnny?","The Killing"
"394",1436477,1438853,"Ah, I don't think I'll have to kill her.","The Killing"
"395",1438938,1441106,"Just slap that pretty faceinto hamburger meat, that's all.","The Killing"
"396",1442149,1444400,"Marv, why don't you take yourselfa walk for an hour or so?","The Killing"
"397",1444485,1447946,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll be -I'll be back in a couple of hours.","The Killing"
"398",1489864,1493700,"All right, sister, that's a mighty pretty headyou've got on your shoulders.","The Killing"
"399",1493784,1496619,"You wanna keep it there, or do you wannastart carrying it around in your hands?","The Killing"
"400",1496704,1499414,"Maybe we could compromiseand put it on your shoulder.","The Killing"
"401",1499498,1502792,"- I think that'd be nice, don't you?- What were you doing outside that door?","The Killing"
"402",1502877,1506421,"Doing? I was listening, naturally.Trying to, I should say.","The Killing"
"403",1506505,1508506,"Oh, you admit it?You admit you were out there snooping?","The Killing"
"404",1508591,1512135,"Yes. Wasn't that naughty of me?But I'm afraid I was.","The Killing"
"405",1512219,1514262,"I found an address in George's pocket.","The Killing"
"406",1514346,1517140,"I thought he might be playing aroundwith another woman, so I came over here.","The Killing"
"407",1517224,1520560,"And you'd care if he was playin'another dame? That would bother you?","The Killing"
"408",1523022,1526608,"You don't understand me, Johnny.You don't know me very well.","The Killing"

"410",1530237,1533364,"You'd sell out your own mother for a pieceof fudge, but you're smart along with it.","The Killing"
"411",1533490,1537202,"Smart enough to know when to selland when to sit tight, and you know
you better sit tight in this case.","The Killing"
"412",1537286,1539913,"- I do?- You heard me. You like money.","The Killing"
"413",1539997,1543291,"You got a great big dollar sign therewhere most women have a heart.","The Killing"
"414",1543375,1546211,"So play it smart. Stay in character,and you'll have money, plenty of it.","The Killing"
"415",1546295,1549923,"George'll have it, and he'll blow it on you.Probably buy himself a five-cent cigar.","The Killing"
"416",1550007,1552759,"Mmm. You don't know mevery well, Johnny.","The Killing"
"417",1552843,1556971,"I wouldn't think of letting Georgethrow his money away on cigars.","The Killing"
"418",1557056,1559474,"Isn't there a big ""if"" in there somewhere?","The Killing"
"419",1559558,1561434,"Yeah. There's a couple of 'em.","The Killing"
"420",1561560,1565355,"If you're smart, if you keep your trap shutand don't nose around anymore,
you'll have money.","The Killing"
"421",1565439,1567106,"You'll be loaded with a capital ""L.""","The Killing"

"423",1569276,1570985,"Nothing will happen,and you won't have a penny.","The Killing"
"424",1571070,1574906,"I wouldn't like that, and, frail as I am,I'd much prefer to be loaded.","The Killing"

"432",1593884,1595927,"It's a wonder we both didn't get killed.","The Killing"
"433",1596053,1600682,"I don't think there was much danger of that.After all, if they'd killed you,
there couldn't be a robbery.","The Killing"
"434",1600766,1603643,"If they'd done anything to harm meor seriously offend you, why -","The Killing"
"435",1603727,1605853,"They have offended me.They've offended me plenty.","The Killing"
"436",1605938,1608356,"Oh, George, don't be such an old bear.","The Killing"

"438",1610693,1615196,"Well, what else could they have done?I thought they acted quite reasonably.","The Killing"
"439",1615281,1617282,"Well, anyway -","The Killing"
"440",1617366,1620743,"What - What did Johnny do to you?","The Killing"

"446",1635175,1638678,"Why did you come over there tonight,Sherry? It wasn't for the reason you said.","The Killing"
"447",1638762,1641472,"It was for the reason you said, George.You said it yourself.","The Killing"
"448",1641557,1645310,"I was just trying to make an alibi for you.I was afraid those guys'd kill you.","The Killing"
"449",1645394,1647478,"You know that I wouldn't lookat another woman.","The Killing"
"450",1647563,1649939,"There wouldn't be any womenchasing after a guy like me.","The Killing"

"465",1686352,1688811,"Well, you just keep onthinking about that, George.","The Killing"
"466",1688896,1692231,"Think how disappointed I'd beif you didn't get that money.","The Killing"
"467",1692316,1694692,"I'm afraid I'd feel likeyou didn't really love me.","The Killing"
"468",1694777,1697779,"I don't see how I could feel any other way.","The Killing"
"469",1697863,1702283,"Why? Why should I have to do a thinglike that to prove to you that I love you?","The Killing"
"470",1702368,1705536,"George, what are you gonna do?I wanna know right now.","The Killing"

"514",1835083,1838628,"You know, I often thoughtthat the gangster and the artist...","The Killing"
"515",1838712,1841255,"are the same in the eyes of the masses.","The Killing"
"516",1841340,1845551,"They're admired and hero-worshipped,but there is always present...","The Killing"
"517",1845636,1849430,"underlying wish to see them destroyedat the peak of their glory.","The Killing"
"518",1849515,1851682,"Yeah. Like the, um -","The Killing"
"519",1851767,1856103,"Like the man said,""Life is like a glass of tea."" Huh?","The Killing"

"522",1862402,1865112,"How, uh - How's lifebeen treating you, Maurice?","The Killing"
"523",1866114,1868282,"About the same as always.","The Killing"
"524",1868367,1870952,"When I need some money,I go out and wrestle.","The Killing"
"525",1871036,1874121,"But mostly I'm up here,wasting my time playing chess.","The Killing"
"526",1874206,1877333,"But, you know, I wouldn't knowwhat to do with myself...","The Killing"
"527",1877417,1879961,"if I didn't have this place to come to.","The Killing"
"528",1880045,1882964,"Maurice, could you use $2,500?","The Killing"
"529",1883048,1886759,"It has a pleasant ring to the ear.Quite musical.","The Killing"
"530",1886843,1888469,"What is it for?","The Killing"
"531",1888554,1891889,"For taking care of half a dozen private dicks.Racetrack cops.","The Killing"
"532",1891974,1894141,"I want you to start a fightwith the bartender at the track.","The Killing"
"533",1894226,1897270,"The track cops will try to break it up.You keep 'em busy for as long as you can.","The Killing"
"534",1897354,1900398,"Make 'em drag you out of the place.No gunplay. Strictly a muscle job.","The Killing"
"535",1900482,1902525,"Would it be out of order for me to ask...","The Killing"
"536",1902609,1906821,"for what it is that you are willing to pay sucha price to see me demonstrate my talents?","The Killing"
"537",1906905,1911409,"I would imagine it is for morethan just your own personal entertainment.","The Killing"
"538",1911493,1915371,"$2,500 is a lot of dough, Maurice.Part of it's for not asking questions.","The Killing"
"539",1915455,1917665,"That sounds not unreasonable.","The Killing"
"540",1917749,1922295,"Still, I will probably go to jail,and jails I have found unpleasant.","The Killing"
"541",1922379,1926882,"Food is very bad, company is poor,beds are too small.","The Killing"
"542",1926967,1930469,"Ah, it'll only be a disorderly conduct charge.Maybe 60 days, nothing worse.","The Killing"
"543",1930596,1934223,"And if a man has a little moneyto spread around in the right places,
he can be quite comfortable for his stay.","The Killing"
"544",1934308,1936350,"I do not quite understand, Johnny.","The Killing"
"545",1936435,1940605,"For what you want me to do, you couldget any hoodlum for a hundred dollars.","The Killing"
"546",1940689,1943065,"Yeah. I don't want any hoodlum.I want a guy like you.","The Killing"
"547",1943150,1945026,"Someone who's absolutely dependable...","The Killing"
"548",1945110,1948112,"who knows he's being well-paid to take a riskand won't squawk if the going gets rough.","The Killing"
"549",1948196,1952241,"I was thinking, if perhaps you can'twork out some other arrangement -","The Killing"
"550",1952326,1955286,"2,500 I like very much.","The Killing"
"551",1955370,1957830,"But suppose I were willingto forgo part of it...","The Killing"
"552",1957914,1961709,"and take a sharein your, uh, enterprise instead.","The Killing"
"553",1961793,1964545,"- No?- No. It's not mine to share up.","The Killing"
"554",1964630,1968466,"Very well, Johnny. Now I sensethere will be certain details to work out.","The Killing"
"555",1968550,1971385,"Yeah. I'll buy you a cup of coffee, huh?","The Killing"
"556",1977684,1980936,"- It's beautiful, isn't it?- Yeah, it's exactly what I wanted.","The Killing"
"557",1981021,1984398,"Yeah, pops, you could take care of a wholeroomful of people with that gun.","The Killing"
"558",1984483,1987401,"Maybe not kill 'em all, but then theywouldn't be good for anything afterwards.","The Killing"
"559",1987486,1991864,"I knew you'd take care of it for me, Nikki.Say, uh, how long have you had this place?","The Killing"
"560",1991948,1993407,"Almost a year.","The Killing"
"561",1993492,1996160,"Yeah, and it's picturesque enough,but there can't be much profit in it.","The Killing"
"562",1996244,1999955,"There isn't.But then there isn't much trouble neither.","The Killing"
"563",2000040,2004710,"- What are you thinking about?- A job. Your kind of a job. A job with a rifle.","The Killing"
"564",2004795,2006837,"- What kind of money, pops?- 5,000.","The Killing"
"565",2007839,2010424,"- Who do I have to kill?- A horse.","The Killing"
"566",2010509,2012426,"- A horse?- A four-legged horse.","The Killing"
"567",2012511,2014428,"- And for that I get 5,000?- Well, for that and -","The Killing"
"568",2014513,2017640,"I figured there'd be a gimmick.","The Killing"
"569",2017724,2020267,"The gimmick isn't as toughas you may think.","The Killing"
"570",2020352,2023646,"You shoot the horse, and, if by any chanceanything goes wrong, you don't squawk.","The Killing"
"571",2023730,2025815,"And all I gotta do is bump off a horse?","The Killing"
"572",2025899,2028109,"- Well, it's a special kind of a horse, Nick.- So?","The Killing"
"573",2028193,2030236,"For certain reasons,including your own protection...","The Killing"
"574",2030320,2033781,"in case anything happens, I'm not gonnagive you the whole story, just your part of it.","The Killing"
"575",2033865,2036450,"Next Saturday the $100,000 handicapis being run.","The Killing"
"576",2036535,2039870,"In the seventh race - that's the big race ofthe season - there's a certain horse running.","The Killing"
"577",2039955,2042581,"He's one of the best three-year-oldsto come along in the last 10 years.","The Killing"
"578",2042708,2046585,"He's a big money winner, and he won'tpay even money because half the people
out there are gonna be down on him.","The Killing"
"579",2046670,2050464,"All right. There's a parking lot less than 300feet from the northwest corner of the track.","The Killing"
"580",2050549,2052675,"From a car parkedin the southeast corner of that lot...","The Killing"
"581",2052759,2057138,"you get a perfect view of the horsesas they come around the far corner
and start into the stretch.","The Killing"
"582",2057264,2061183,"A man sitting in a car parked in that spotusing a high-powered rifle
with a telescopic sight...","The Killing"
"583",2061268,2063894,"should be able to bring downany given horse with a single shot.","The Killing"
"584",2063979,2066814,"And a man with your eyewould hardly need a telescopic sight.","The Killing"
"585",2066898,2068816,"That horse is wortha quarter of a million bucks...","The Killing"
"586",2068900,2070651,"and you know the crowdwould go completely nuts.","The Killing"
"587",2070736,2073237,"So what? Let 'em go nuts.You can do it. You can do it easy.","The Killing"
"588",2073321,2076031,"And you shouldn't have too much troublegetting away in the confusion.","The Killing"
"589",2076116,2078951,"Red Lightning will undoubtedly be leadingin the stretch because that's the way he runs.","The Killing"
"590",2079035,2081537,"So he goes down, a couple of other horsespile up on top of him.","The Killing"
"591",2081621,2084165,"- There'll be plenty of confusion.I can guarantee you that.
- Yeah.","The Killing"
"592",2084291,2088502,"And there's one more thing -Suppose by accident you do get picked up.
What've you done? You shot a horse.","The Killing"
"593",2088587,2091839,"It isn't first-degree murder.In fact, it isn't even murder.
In fact, I don't know what it is.","The Killing"
"594",2091923,2095176,"But the chances are, the best they couldget you on would be, uh, inciting a riot...","The Killing"
"595",2095260,2097511,"or shooting horses out of seasonor something like that.","The Killing"
"596",2097596,2100389,"Well, you put it down, 'cause you make itsound real simple. You know, pops?","The Killing"
"597",2100474,2103058,"- 5,000 bucks for rubbin' out a horse.","The Killing"
"598",2103143,2105853,"- Okay, pops. How do I get it?","The Killing"
"599",2105937,2109857,"- 2,500 today, 2,500 the day after the race.- Okay. Crazy. Now, tell me something -","The Killing"
"600",2109941,2113569,"What's your angle, John?They'll probably call the race off, huh?","The Killing"
"601",2113653,2115863,"And they won't pay off any of the bets?Come on.","The Killing"
"602",2115947,2118741,"Maybe. But what my angle isis my business.","The Killing"

"690",2431096,2433931,"I tried to stop him.I pleaded and I struggled.","The Killing"
"691",2434933,2436975,"But -","The Killing"
"692",2437060,2439394,"Oh. It doesn't matter, does it, darling?","The Killing"

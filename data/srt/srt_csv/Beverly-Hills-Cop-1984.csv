"902",3932846,3935889,"Now, listen to me,my tough little friend.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"903",3936057,3938892,"I don't know from underwhat stone you crawled,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"904",3939853,3943397,"or where you get theseridiculous ideas about me,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"905",3944107,3945983,"but it seems painfully obvious","Beverly Hills Cop"
"906",3946151,3949987,"you haven't the slightest fuckingidea who you're dealing with.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"907",3951197,3954366,"Now, my advice to you is...","Beverly Hills Cop"
"908",3954534,3957369,"...crawl back to yourlittle stone in Detroit,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"909",3957537,3961373,"before you get squashed, OK?","Beverly Hills Cop"

"912",3965378,3967755,"- Nice meeting you again.- Yeah.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"913",3974387,3976513,"Catch you later, Vic.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"914",3976681,3978766,"I can't wait.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"915",3991905,3995115,"Don't I know you guys from some place?You look so familiar.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"916",3997619,4001080,"Detective Foley,this is becoming very irritating.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"917",4001247,4003332,"Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"918",4006753,4010422,"I had a friend named Michael Tandinothat used to work for Victor Maitland.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"919",4010590,4013592,"And Maitland had him killed.I can't prove that right now,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"920",4013760,4015844,"but when I do,you'll be the first to know.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"921",4017931,4020891,"Forget what you can prove.Talk to me.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"922",4023603,4026438,"OK, listen, everybody knowsthat Victor Maitland","Beverly Hills Cop"
"923",4026606,4028107,"is a hot-shot art dealer, OK?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"924",4028274,4031402,"But I did some pokin' around andart's not the only thing that he deals.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"925",4031569,4034405,"I went to his warehouseand I saw some guys unloading a crate","Beverly Hills Cop"
"926",4034572,4036740,"that was filledwith German bearer bonds.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"927",4036908,4040160,"Now, my friend Michael Tandinohad bonds like this on him,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"928",4040328,4042788,"coincidentally,when he was killed in Detroit.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"929",4042956,4043956,"Just because Maitland chooses","Beverly Hills Cop"
"930",4044124,4046125,"to invest in the same kind of bondsyour friend had,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"931",4046292,4047876,"doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"932",4048044,4050838,"The man's not an investor,he's a smuggler, OK?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"933",4051005,4053549,"Be it bonds or drugs or whatever.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"934",4053717,4056301,"The crate that I sawdidn't even pass through Customs.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"935",4056469,4058137,"Maitland is paying someone so his guys","Beverly Hills Cop"
"936",4058304,4060973,"can get the shipments out of Customsbefore they get inspected.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"937",4061141,4062975,"Maitland's guys get their hands on it,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"938",4063143,4065310,"they take the drugsor the bonds out of the crates","Beverly Hills Cop"
"939",4065478,4068564,"and they send it back beforeCustoms even knows what's going on.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"940",4071443,4072901,"And you witnessed all this?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"941",4073069,4075362,"Everything except for the drugs,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"942",4075530,4077865,"but I found coffee groundsall over the warehouse.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"943",4078867,4079992,"Coffee grounds?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"944",4080160,4082119,"You said something about that before.What does that mean?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"945",4082287,4084580,"Drugs are sometimespacked in coffee grounds.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"946",4084748,4085998,"The scent throws off the dogs.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"947",4086166,4088333,"Very good, lieutenant.Now what do we do?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"948",4090712,4092504,"Look, Detective Foley, I...","Beverly Hills Cop"
"949",4093840,4095674,"I'm sorry.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"950",4095842,4097342,"I'd really like to help you.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"951",4098261,4100679,"If you'd found the drugs,that's one thing,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"952",4100847,4103182,"but if your only evidenceis coffee grounds,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"953",4103349,4104975,"we don't have enoughto get a search warrant.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"954",4105143,4106852,"Come on, guys,I know how we can get around...","Beverly Hills Cop"
"955",4107020,4109646,"We don't get around search warrantsin Beverly Hills.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"956",4111608,4113484,"- Taggart.- Yes, sir.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"957",4113651,4115277,"I want you to start checking this out.","Beverly Hills Cop"

"959",4119199,4120574,"Hey, wait a minute, Taggart.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"960",4120742,4123076,"Look, lieutenant,Maitland is much smarter than that.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"961",4123244,4124870,"We go and startsnoopin' around his place,","Beverly Hills Cop"
"962",4125038,4127122,"he's gonna close down and gethis shipments from someplace else.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"963",4127290,4129541,"- It'd be a big waste of time.- Oh, really?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"964",4129709,4132377,"Is that what your extensive experienceleads you to believe?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"965",4132545,4134755,"- Look, I haven't been on your force...- Sir!","Beverly Hills Cop"
"966",4137050,4138217,"Oh, shit.","Beverly Hills Cop"

"970",4151272,4152481,"Yes, sir.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"971",4152649,4155984,"Who lured Taggart and Rosemont","Beverly Hills Cop"

"989",4234939,4239318,"The two charges of disturbing the peacehave been dropped against you.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"990",4239485,4242321,"But the chief says if you returnto the city of Beverly Hills,","Beverly Hills Cop"

"1005",4297961,4300921,"who says he's a friendof Michael Tandino.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"1006",4301881,4305175,"He came by the office yesterdayand asked me all sorts of...","Beverly Hills Cop"
"1007",4305343,4307469,"...rather odd questions.Excuse me, darling.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"1008",4308429,4310889,"I believe his name is Foley.","Beverly Hills Cop"
"1009",4311057,4314393,"Since you were such a good friend ofMichael, I was wondering if you were...","Beverly Hills Cop"
"1010",4314560,4316645,"...perhaps familiar with the fellow?","Beverly Hills Cop"
"1011",4316813,4319648,"Well, we... grew upin the same neighborhood.","Beverly Hills Cop"

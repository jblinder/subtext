"3",101935,104770,"Five weeks later,the German army had smashed its way...","Paths of Glory"
"4",104854,107106,"to within 18 miles of Paris.","Paths of Glory"
"5",107190,111443,"There, the battered French miraculouslyrallied their forces at the Marne River...","Paths of Glory"
"6",111528,113779,"- and in a seriesof unexpected counterattacks —
- Detail, halt!","Paths of Glory"
"7",113863,115948,"- drove the Germans back.","Paths of Glory"
"8",116032,117741,"The front was stabilized...","Paths of Glory"
"9",117826,120369,"then shortly afterwards developedinto a continuous line...","Paths of Glory"
"10",120453,122371,"of heavily fortified trenches...","Paths of Glory"
"11",122455,124706,"zigzagging their way 500 miles...","Paths of Glory"
"12",124791,127459,"from the English Channelto the Swiss frontier.","Paths of Glory"
"13",128628,132464,"By 1916, after two grisly yearsof trench warfare...","Paths of Glory"
"14",132549,134758,"the battle lines had changed very little.","Paths of Glory"
"15",135760,139138,"Successful attacks were measuredin hundreds of yards...","Paths of Glory"
"16",139222,142266,"and paid for in livesby hundreds of thousands.","Paths of Glory"
"17",145395,147062,"General Broulard, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"18",147147,149606,"- Hello, George. How are you?","Paths of Glory"
"19",149691,152359,"Paul, wonderful seeing you again.Really wonderful.","Paths of Glory"
"20",152443,155904,"Well, this is splendid. It's superb.","Paths of Glory"
"21",155989,158157,"It's grand, very grand.","Paths of Glory"
"22",158241,160951,"Well, I've tried to createa pleasant atmosphere in which to work.","Paths of Glory"
"23",161035,163704,"Well, you've succeeded marvelously.I wish I had your taste in carpets —","Paths of Glory"
"24",163788,165455,"- Oh! - and pictures.","Paths of Glory"
"25",165540,167499,"You're much too kind, George.Much too kind.","Paths of Glory"
"26",167584,169501,"- Sit down, George.- Thank you.","Paths of Glory"
"27",169586,174089,"I really haven't done very much. The placeis much the same as it was when I moved in.","Paths of Glory"
"28",175133,178886,"Paul, I've come to see youabout something big.","Paths of Glory"
"29",178970,182181,"It's top secret and must go no furtherthan your chief of staff...","Paths of Glory"
"30",182265,184516,"and not to himunless you can trust his discretion.","Paths of Glory"
"31",184601,185934,"Of course.","Paths of Glory"
"32",186019,189563,"A group of armies is forming on this frontfor an offensive very soon.","Paths of Glory"
"33",189647,191857,"Headquarters is determinedto make a complete breakthrough.","Paths of Glory"
"34",191941,194359,"- Why are you smiling?- I'm really sorry.","Paths of Glory"
"35",194444,197821,"I thought for just a moment I knewwhat you were going to say. Please go on.","Paths of Glory"
"36",197906,201867,"I never knew you were a mind reader.What did you think I was about to say?","Paths of Glory"
"37",201951,204578,"- Something about the ""Anthill.""- You are a mind reader.","Paths of Glory"
"38",204662,208332,"Well, it is a key position.It's in my sector.","Paths of Glory"
"39",208416,210500,"To be perfectly honest,I've heard some talk.","Paths of Glory"
"40",210585,212920,"You know, there's nothing really secretaround headquarters.","Paths of Glory"
"41",213004,216924,"- Well, what do you think?- It's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.","Paths of Glory"
"42",217008,219009,"They've held on to it for a year now...","Paths of Glory"
"43",219093,221803,"and it looks as though they'll hold on to itfor another year if they want to.","Paths of Glory"
"44",221888,224264,"Paul, I have formal ordersto take the Anthill no later than the 10th.","Paths of Glory"
"45",224349,227976,"- That's the day after tomorrow.- That comes pretty close
to being ridiculous, don't you think?","Paths of Glory"
"46",228061,231647,"I don't imagine I'd be hereif I really thought that.","Paths of Glory"
"47",231731,236235,"Paul, if there's one manin this army who can do this for me, it's you.","Paths of Glory"
"48",236319,240239,"It's out of the question, George.Absolutely out of the question.","Paths of Glory"
"49",240323,242407,"My division was cut to pieces.","Paths of Glory"
"50",242492,246036,"What's left of it is in no positionto even hold the Anthill, let alone take it.","Paths of Glory"
"51",246120,248121,"I'm sorry, but that's the truth.","Paths of Glory"
"52",249290,252626,"Well, Paul, there was something elseI wanted to tell you.","Paths of Glory"
"53",252710,255462,"However, I'm sure that you'll misunderstandmy motives in mentioning it.","Paths of Glory"
"54",255546,258048,"- What was it?- Oh.","Paths of Glory"
"55",258132,260342,"You'd be bound to misunderstand.","Paths of Glory"
"56",260426,263971,"However, as your friend,maybe I should tell you.","Paths of Glory"
"57",264055,265347,"What are you trying to say, George?","Paths of Glory"
"58",265431,270435,"Paul, talk around headquarters is that youare being considered for the 12th Corps.","Paths of Glory"
"59",270520,273230,"- The 12th Corps?- Yes, and with that, another star.","Paths of Glory"
"60",273314,275232,"Now, I've pushed it all I can.","Paths of Glory"
"61",275316,278610,"The 12th Corps needs a fighting general,and you're overdue on that star.","Paths of Glory"
"62",278695,280904,"Now, we both knowthat your record is good enough...","Paths of Glory"
"63",280989,283782,"for you to refuse this assignmenton the grounds you've stated.","Paths of Glory"
"64",283866,285784,"No one would question your opinion.","Paths of Glory"
"65",285868,288328,"They'd simply get someone elseto do the job.","Paths of Glory"
"66",288413,292040,"So you shouldn't let thisinfluence your opinion, Paul.","Paths of Glory"
"67",294043,297045,"- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?- No, thanks, Paul, not before dinner.","Paths of Glory"
"68",301551,304886,"George, I'm responsiblefor the lives of 8,000 men.","Paths of Glory"
"69",306222,308932,"What is my ambition against that?","Paths of Glory"
"70",309017,312352,"What is my reputationin comparison to that?","Paths of Glory"
"71",312437,315564,"My men come first of all, George,and those men know it too.","Paths of Glory"
"72",315648,317482,"I know that they do.","Paths of Glory"
"73",317567,320652,"You see, George, those men knowthat I would never let them down.","Paths of Glory"
"74",320737,322404,"That goes without saying.","Paths of Glory"
"75",322488,324698,"The life of one ofthose soldiersmeans more to me...","Paths of Glory"
"76",324782,328035,"than all the stars and decorationsand honors in France.","Paths of Glory"
"77",328119,330454,"So...","Paths of Glory"
"78",330538,334333,"you think this attack is absolutely beyondthe ability of your men at this time?","Paths of Glory"
"79",334417,336585,"I didn't say that, George.","Paths of Glory"
"80",337795,341089,"Nothing is beyond those men,once their fighting spirit is aroused.","Paths of Glory"
"81",341174,344176,"Paul, I don't want to push you into itif you think it's ill-advised.","Paths of Glory"
"82",344260,347471,"Don't worry, George.You couldn't do that if you tried.","Paths of Glory"
"83",349015,351475,"Of course, artillery would makean enormous difference.","Paths of Glory"
"84",352477,355395,"- What artillery support can you give me?- Well, I'll see.","Paths of Glory"
"85",355480,357147,"What about replacements?","Paths of Glory"
"86",357231,361151,"We'll see what we can do, but I feel surethat you can get along with what you have.","Paths of Glory"
"87",361235,363779,"- Might just do it.- Oh, Paul.","Paths of Glory"
"88",363863,367699,"I knew that I was right to come to you.You are the man to take the Anthill.","Paths of Glory"
"89",367784,371078,"- Now, as far as that star is concerned —- That had nothing to do with my decision.","Paths of Glory"
"90",371162,374915,"- If anything, it would sway me the other way.- I realize that perfectly, Paul.","Paths of Glory"
"91",374999,377000,"Now, when do you sayyou see this coming off?","Paths of Glory"
"92",377085,379378,"No later than the day after tomorrow.","Paths of Glory"
"93",379462,381129,"We just might do it.","Paths of Glory"
"94",403486,406238,"Hello there, soldier.Ready to kill more Germans?","Paths of Glory"
"95",406322,408240,"- Yes, sir.- What's your name, soldier?","Paths of Glory"
"96",408324,410033,"Sir, Private Ferol, Company ""A.""","Paths of Glory"
"97",410118,412119,"- Uh-huh. Are you married, Private?- No, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"98",412203,414746,"- Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.- Yes, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"99",414831,417707,"- Well, carry on, Private, and good luck to you.","Paths of Glory"
"100",417792,419709,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"101",424257,426258,"- Good morning, General.- Good morning.","Paths of Glory"
"102",426342,429136,"Hello there, soldier.Ready to kill more Germans?","Paths of Glory"
"103",429220,432264,"- Yes, sir.- Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.","Paths of Glory"
"104",432348,434724,"Well, that's the way.It's a soldier's best friend.","Paths of Glory"
"105",434809,437227,"You be good to it,and it'll always be good to you.","Paths of Glory"
"106",437311,439229,"Yes, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"107",441107,443984,"[Chuckles]Well, uh, good luck to you, soldier.","Paths of Glory"

"110",472305,474347,"Hello there, soldier.","Paths of Glory"
"111",474432,476892,"Ready to kill more Germans?","Paths of Glory"
"112",478144,480145,"Well, is everything all right, soldier?","Paths of Glory"
"113",480229,483273,"All right? Yes, sir, I'm all right.","Paths of Glory"
"114",483357,486401,"Aha. Good fellow.Are you married, soldier?","Paths of Glory"
"115",486486,489112,"- Married? Me, married?","Paths of Glory"
"116",490114,493492,"- Yes. Have you got a wife?- A wife? Have I got a wife?","Paths of Glory"
"117",493576,495827,"Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.","Paths of Glory"
"118",495912,499831,"I beg your pardon, Sergeant.There is no such thing as shell shock.","Paths of Glory"
"119",501334,504377,"- Have you got a wife, soldier?- My wife?","Paths of Glory"
"120",504462,507339,"My wife. Yes, I have a wife.","Paths of Glory"
"121",507423,510091,"I'm never gonna see her again.I'm gonna be killed.","Paths of Glory"
"122",510176,511927,"Get a grip on yourself!You're acting like a coward!","Paths of Glory"
"123",512011,514554,"- I am a coward, sir.- Snap out of it, soldier!","Paths of Glory"
"124",514680,518600,"Sergeant, I want you to arrangefor the immediate transfer of this baby
out of my regiment!","Paths of Glory"
"125",518684,521269,"I won't have other brave mencontaminated by him!","Paths of Glory"
"126",521354,523772,"- Yes, sir.- Carry on, Sergeant.","Paths of Glory"
"127",527109,531154,"You were right, sir. This sort of thingcan spread if it isn't checked.","Paths of Glory"
"128",531239,533365,"You know, General,I'm convinced that these tours of yours...","Paths of Glory"
"129",533449,536034,"have an incalculable effectupon the morale of these men.","Paths of Glory"
"130",536118,538912,"In fact, I think the fighting spiritofthe 701st derives from it.","Paths of Glory"
"131",538996,541081,"No, no, Major.That spirit was just born in them.","Paths of Glory"
"132",541165,542832,"","Paths of Glory"
"133",544460,546461,"","Paths of Glory"
"134",548422,550423,"The general is coming, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"135",555638,557639,"","Paths of Glory"
"136",565064,568066,"- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.- I'm honored, General.","Paths of Glory"
"137",568150,570151,"It's our privilege entirely.","Paths of Glory"
"138",570236,573405,"- Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.- Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"139",573489,576408,"I reserve comment on the neatness, sir,but it is little.","Paths of Glory"
"140",576492,579411,"- Pretty shy on seatingaccommodations though.","Paths of Glory"
"141",579495,582747,"More than enough for me.I never got the habit of sitting.","Paths of Glory"
"142",582832,585500,"Like to be on my feet.Keep on the move.","Paths of Glory"
"143",585585,587335,"I can vouch for that, Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"144",587420,590630,"I can hardly get the general behind a desklong enough to sign an order.","Paths of Glory"
"145",590715,592757,"Well, that's the way I am, you know, Dax.","Paths of Glory"
"146",592842,595760,"I can't understand these armchair officers...","Paths of Glory"
"147",595845,597971,"fellows trying to fight a warfrom behind a desk...","Paths of Glory"
"148",598055,599973,"waving papers at the enemy...","Paths of Glory"
"149",600057,603143,"worrying about whether a mouseis going to run up their pants leg.","Paths of Glory"
"150",603227,606104,"I don't know, General. If I had the choicebetween mice and Mausers...","Paths of Glory"
"151",606188,608106,"I think I'd take the mice every time.","Paths of Glory"
"152",608190,610108,"You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"153",610192,612652,"Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...","Paths of Glory"
"154",612737,615113,"let him put on a dressand hide under the bed.","Paths of Glory"
"155",615197,618325,"But if he wants to be a soldier,then, by heavens, he's got to be one.","Paths of Glory"
"156",618409,621494,"He's got to fight, and he can't do thatunless he's where the fighting is.","Paths of Glory"
"157",621579,623622,"That's my credo.","Paths of Glory"
"158",623706,626958,"I think I have to agree with you,presenting your case so convincingly, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"159",627043,629252,"And you've never failedto live up to it, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"160",629337,631630,"- I imagine you'd likea look around, wouldn't you?
- Yes, Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"161",631714,634215,"- Well, here's something to see.","Paths of Glory"
"162",634300,637594,"The Anthill. About as good a viewas you can get without actually being there.","Paths of Glory"
"163",637678,639971,"Well, that won't be long now, will it?","Paths of Glory"
"164",640056,641973,"","Paths of Glory"
"165",642933,645727,"- Ah.","Paths of Glory"
"166",645811,647729,"Ah. Yeah.","Paths of Glory"
"167",648814,652359,"Well, I've seenmuch more formidable objectives.","Paths of Glory"
"168",652443,654402,"Much, much worse.","Paths of Glory"
"169",659241,663370,"Well, not something we can graband run away with...","Paths of Glory"
"170",663454,665664,"but certainly pregnable.","Paths of Glory"
"171",665748,668500,"- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?- Why?","Paths of Glory"
"172",668584,671002,"Well, like something to dowith giving birth.","Paths of Glory"
"173",671087,674047,"Oh, yes. Quite. You're righton your toes this morning, Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"174",674131,676007,"Even sharper than usual.","Paths of Glory"
"175",676133,680053,"But we mustn't forget,the colonel was perhaps the foremost
criminal lawyer in all France.","Paths of Glory"
"176",680137,683098,"- Of course, General.- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.","Paths of Glory"
"177",684100,687435,"Tell me, Colonel, how did your reliefcome off last night?","Paths of Glory"
"178",687520,690522,"We drew some artillery.Twenty-nine casualties, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"179",690606,692524,"Yes, I noticed it on the road in.","Paths of Glory"
"180",692608,694651,"Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.","Paths of Glory"
"181",694735,697696,"All swarmed together like a bunch of flies,just waiting for someone to swat 'em.","Paths of Glory"
"182",697780,699698,"Well, they never learn, it seems.","Paths of Glory"
"183",699782,703326,"They get in a tight spot under heavy fire,gang up every time.","Paths of Glory"
"184",703411,706079,"Herd instinct, I suppose.Kind of a lower-animal sort of thing.","Paths of Glory"
"185",706163,708373,"Kind of a human sort of thing,it seems to me...","Paths of Glory"
"186",708457,710500,"or don't you make a distinctionbetween the two, Major?","Paths of Glory"
"187",710584,714045,"Oh, yes, uh, very regrettable, of course.Very. Yes, indeed.","Paths of Glory"
"188",714130,717590,"Uh, Major, would you be kind enoughto excuse us for a few minutes?","Paths of Glory"
"189",717675,719676,"Yes, sir. Of course.","Paths of Glory"
"190",720845,722846,"Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"191",722930,726808,"","Paths of Glory"
"192",726892,729477,"Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?","Paths of Glory"
"193",729562,732439,"- What do I think of what, sir?- The Anthill.","Paths of Glory"
"194",732523,735817,"Colonel, your regimentis going to take the Anthill tomorrow.","Paths of Glory"
"195",737278,739237,"You know the condition of my men, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"196",739321,742699,"Oh, naturally, men are going to have tobe killed. Possibly a lot of them.","Paths of Glory"
"197",742783,744784,"They absorb bullets and shrapnel...","Paths of Glory"
"198",744869,747328,"and by doing so make it possiblefor others to get through.","Paths of Glory"
"199",747413,750039,"- What support will we have?- I have none to give you.","Paths of Glory"
"200",751751,754419,"What sort of casualtiesdo you anticipate, sir?","Paths of Glory"
"201",754503,757255,"Hmm, say, five percent killedby our own barrage.","Paths of Glory"
"202",757339,759257,"That's a very generous allowance.","Paths of Glory"
"203",759341,761676,"Ten percent morein getting through no-man's-land...","Paths of Glory"
"204",761761,763970,"and 20% more getting through the wire.","Paths of Glory"
"205",764054,767891,"That leaves 65%with the worst part of the job over.","Paths of Glory"
"206",767975,771978,"Let's say another 25%in actually taking the Anthill.","Paths of Glory"
"207",772062,775148,"We're still left with a forcemore than adequate to hold it.","Paths of Glory"
"208",775232,778067,"General, you're saying that morethan half of my men will be killed.","Paths of Glory"
"209",778152,781112,"Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel...","Paths of Glory"
"210",781197,783865,"but we will have the Anthill.","Paths of Glory"
"211",783949,787118,"- But will we, sir?- I'm depending on you, Colonel.","Paths of Glory"
"212",787203,789204,"All France is depending on you.","Paths of Glory"
"213",793042,795084,"Am I amusing you, Colonel?","Paths of Glory"

"542",2386967,2388885,"I think that was very selfish of you.","Paths of Glory"
"543",2388969,2393014,"Thank you for your courtesy, General,but I'm afraid there isn't much time

"555",2443399,2445942,"Well, in cases like this —shells falling short —","Paths of Glory"
"556",2446026,2448027,"I — I always try to avoid an inquiry.","Paths of Glory"
"557",2448112,2451322,"It gets around among the menand makes a bad impression.","Paths of Glory"
"558",2451407,2453908,"No, shelving will be the best disciplinefor him, in my opinion.","Paths of Glory"
"559",2453993,2456953,"- Well, perhaps you're right.- Oh, uh, would you excuse me for a moment?","Paths of Glory"

"585",2550714,2553800,"You have your orders, gentlemen.Let's carry them out.","Paths of Glory"
"586",2573654,2576239,"But Lieutenant Rogetkilled Lejeune on that patrol...","Paths of Glory"
"587",2576323,2578575,"and then blackmailed meinto keeping quiet about the whole thing!","Paths of Glory"

"589",2581245,2584038,"But that story has nothing to dowith the charges you're being tried for.","Paths of Glory"

"591",2588252,2590587,"You've got no witnesses.","Paths of Glory"

"715",3034489,3037366,"- Yes, sir.- I don't see that that's significant.","Paths of Glory"
"716",3037451,3041245,"It's accepted practice in the French armyto pick examples by lot.","Paths of Glory"

"718",3043957,3046876,"picking by lotwas eminently fair in this case.","Paths of Glory"
"719",3046960,3049712,"Well, I'd like to point out that this soldierhas distinguished himself ...","Paths of Glory"

"725",3065103,3067063,"The accused is not being triedfor his former bravery...","Paths of Glory"

"741",3126206,3129959,"And were you lying unconsciousin the trenches during the entire attack?","Paths of Glory"
"742",3130043,3131794,"Yes, sir.","Paths of Glory"
"743",3131878,3134380,"That's all.","Paths of Glory"

"755",3182387,3185306,"And I submit that that attack...","Paths of Glory"
"756",3186892,3190186,"was a stain on the flag of France...","Paths of Glory"

"766",3243657,3245282,"to be a member of the human race...","Paths of Glory"
"767",3245367,3247618,"and this is one such occasion.","Paths of Glory"
"768",3250163,3253499,"It's impossible for me to summarizethe case for the defense...","Paths of Glory"
"769",3253583,3257461,"since the court never allowed mea reasonable opportunity to present my case.","Paths of Glory"
"770",3257545,3260464,"Are you protestingthe authenticity of this court?","Paths of Glory"
"771",3263301,3265261,"Yes, sir.","Paths of Glory"

"778",3294374,3299336,"The attack yesterday morningwas no stain on the honor of France...","Paths of Glory"
"779",3301006,3304383,"and certainly no disgraceto the fighting men of this nation.","Paths of Glory"

"961",3948361,3951780,"Though, uh, I must admit that,judging from the casualties...","Paths of Glory"
"962",3951864,3953949,"the efforts of your regimentmust have been considerable.","Paths of Glory"
"963",3954033,3957410,"Now, how can you understand thatand allow these men to be shot tomorrow?","Paths of Glory"
"964",3957495,3960455,"Oh, come, Colonel. You're choosingto take a rather simple view of this thing.","Paths of Glory"
"965",3960539,3964542,"The attack was impossible from the start.The General Staff must have known that.","Paths of Glory"
"966",3965962,3970382,"Colonel Dax, we think we're doinga good job running the war.","Paths of Glory"
"967",3970466,3972384,"You must be aware of the factthat the General Staff...","Paths of Glory"
"968",3972468,3976554,"is subject to all kinds of unfair pressuresfrom newspapers and politicians.","Paths of Glory"
"969",3976639,3979265,"Maybe the attack against the Anthillwas impossible.","Paths of Glory"
"970",3979350,3981768,"Perhaps it was an error of judgmenton our part.","Paths of Glory"
"971",3981852,3986022,"On the other hand, if your men had beena little more daring, they might have taken it.","Paths of Glory"

"973",3988693,3992320,"why should we have to bear any morecriticism for failure than we have to.","Paths of Glory"
"974",3992405,3995991,"Aside from the inescapable fact that a goodmany of your men never left the trenches...","Paths of Glory"
"975",3996075,3998618,"there's the question of the troops' morale.Don't forget that.","Paths of Glory"
"976",3998703,4000578,"- The troops' morale?- Certainly.","Paths of Glory"
"977",4000663,4003665,"These executions will be a perfect tonicfor the entire division.","Paths of Glory"
"978",4003749,4006167,"There are few things more fundamentallyencouraging and stimulating...","Paths of Glory"

"980",4008295,4011172,"- I never thought of that, sir.- You see, Colonel, troops are like children.","Paths of Glory"
"981",4011257,4014676,"Just as a child wants his father to be firm,troops crave discipline.","Paths of Glory"
"982",4014760,4016219,"I see.","Paths of Glory"
"983",4016303,4018847,"And one way to maintain disciplineis to shoot a man now and then.","Paths of Glory"
"984",4019932,4022350,"May I ask...","Paths of Glory"
"985",4022435,4025437,"do you sincerely believeall the things you've just said?","Paths of Glory"
"986",4030484,4032402,"It's been a pleasurediscussing this with you, Colonel...","Paths of Glory"
"987",4032486,4035864,"but I'm afraid that I'd betterbe getting back to my guests.","Paths of Glory"
"988",4035948,4038324,"Forgive me for having kept youfrom your party.","Paths of Glory"
"989",4040995,4044539,"Oh, by the way, sir,have you heard that General Mireau...","Paths of Glory"

"992",4050921,4052422,"","Paths of Glory"
"993",4054800,4058053,"Well, of course the captain refusedwithout a written order...","Paths of Glory"
"994",4058137,4062390,"but General Mireau demanded that hecommence firing on our own trenches.","Paths of Glory"
"995",4062475,4064976,"Again Rousseau refusedwithout an order in writing...","Paths of Glory"
"996",4065061,4069189,"but again he was ordered,and again he refused —","Paths of Glory"

"1011",4120407,4122408,"The only question is who.","Paths of Glory"
"1012",4124495,4127705,"General Mireau's assaulton the Anthill failed...","Paths of Glory"

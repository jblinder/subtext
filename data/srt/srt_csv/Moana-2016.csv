"1",8679,12445,"Hello, I'm John Musker.I'm one of the directors of Moana.","Moana"
"2",12519,16490,"And I'm Ron Clements,and I'm the other director of Moana.","Moana"
"3",16559,21088,"MUSKER: And this is a movie thatwe actually pitched to John Lasseter.","Moana"
"4",21160,23242,"It was back in 2011.","Moana"
"5",23320,24731,"A simple idea, actually,","Moana"
"6",24800,26564,"built aroundthe character Maui originally.","Moana"
"7",26640,29007,"Eventually, Moana came along.","Moana"
"8",29120,32567,"What you're hearing right nowon the track, I might add,","Moana"
"9",32640,37487,"is a wonderful song that Opetaia...An opening chant that he wrote.","Moana"
"10",37560,41645,"And that's his daughter, Olivia,who's doing that very lead vocal.","Moana"
"11",41759,43807,"(CONTINUES CHANTING)","Moana"
"12",46799,48768,"CLEMENTS: Yeah, there wasa funny story that...","Moana"
"13",48840,52606,"When that was recorded, theyactually recorded it in a hotel room.","Moana"
"14",52679,56240,"And when Olivia's doingthat very dramatic chant","Moana"
"15",56320,59243,"at the beginning of the song,they got calls.","Moana"
"16",59320,60401,"I think there were people that thought","Moana"
"17",60479,62527,"maybe someonewas being murdered in the room,","Moana"
"18",62600,66206,"but, actually, it was just recordingthis beautiful opening of the movie.","Moana"
"19",66280,68885,"MUSKER: And, here it is now,so lyric and so beautiful.","Moana"
"20",68960,70370,"So, this whole opening...","Moana"
"21",70439,72487,"This is Eric Goldberg'sanimation, actually.","Moana"
"22",72560,74960,"This is 2D animation.Most of this movie is 3D.","Moana"
"23",75039,77566,"But we wanted thiskind of prologue at the beginning","Moana"
"24",77680,79283,"to feature some hand-drawn animation.","Moana"
"25",79359,81760,"CLEMENTS: Even though this isthe first thing in the movie,","Moana"
"26",81840,84730,"it was actually one of the last thingsanimated in the movie.","Moana"
"27",84799,87564,"- Ironically.- MUSKER: Right. Yeah, and designed...","Moana"
"28",87640,89210,"Ian Gooding had a big hand in this,","Moana"
"29",89280,91725,"in terms of how we were gonnaapproach this tapa traditionally,","Moana"
"30",91799,95281,"which is the pounded bark cloth.It doesn't usually have color on it.","Moana"
"31",95359,96963,"It's only in browns, and blacks,and whites.","Moana"
"32",97039,99042,"But we lit this theatrically","Moana"
"33",99159,103528,"to get the color of this islandof Te Fiti, this mythical island.","Moana"
"34",103599,106444,"CLEMENTS: Very dramaticintroduction of the character of Maui.","Moana"
"35",106520,110490,"Now, this part was actually donefairly early in the course of things.","Moana"
"36",110560,113927,"Storyboarded byour co-head of story, Dave Pimentel.","Moana"
"37",114000,115569,"MUSKER: But we didn't reallyhave an opening like this.","Moana"
"38",115640,117051,"This came later, actually.","Moana"
"39",117120,119121,"There was the thought thatwe really needed to set up Maui,","Moana"
"40",119200,121725,"'cause, originally, we thoughtwe wouldn't see him until","Moana"
"41",121799,124929,"actually even Moana discovered him,when she went off to find him.","Moana"
"42",125000,127162,"So, he actually first appearedmuch later in the movie.","Moana"
"43",127239,130483,"But I think John Lasseterwas among them, the people that felt","Moana"
"44",130560,133643,"we really needed to set upthis plot issue of the movie,","Moana"
"45",133719,135484,"even though that meantshowing Maui at the beginning.","Moana"
"46",135560,139042,"So, this was added halfway throughour story process, I would say.","Moana"
"47",139120,140167,"Somewhere in there.","Moana"
"48",140240,142925,"CLEMENTS: Yeah, this gets intothe gist of it right off the bat.","Moana"
"49",143000,146288,"MUSKER: And already, it's a showcasefor our wonderful effects department","Moana"
"50",146360,149125,"led by Dale Mayeda and Marlon West.","Moana"
"51",149199,151122,"And this whole destructionof the island,","Moana"
"52",151199,153009,"it was really a tour de forcefor the effects artists","Moana"
"53",153079,155969,"to take this beautiful landscapeand tear it apart.","Moana"
"54",156759,161401,"And Maui, of course, transformsinto these different characters that...","Moana"
"55",161479,163687,"CLEMENTS: It was harddoing these transformations,","Moana"
"56",163759,166525,"which surprised us, 'causethe genie in Aladdin was easy,","Moana"
"57",166599,170161,"but transformationsare hard in CG animation.","Moana"
"58",170240,175167,"'Cause you have to design and modeland rig every single transformation.","Moana"
"59",175240,176206,"It's complicated.","Moana"
"60",176319,178687,"MUSKER: And, of course, this is theappearance of our villainess Te Kā,","Moana"
"61",178759,181604,"at one point called ""Te Pō,""but retitled ""Te Kā.""","Moana"
"62",181680,184729,"In earlier versions of the draftof the movie, she actually spoke.","Moana"
"63",184800,185800,"She had dialogue.","Moana"
"64",185879,187370,"But as the story got reworked,","Moana"
"65",187439,189248,"it was felt thatit made her more mythic.","Moana"
"66",189319,191526,"And she didn't reallyhave much to say.","Moana"
"67",191599,194045,"And we didn't want herto talk too much.","Moana"
"68",194120,197203,"So, her voice went away,and she remains just kind of...","Moana"
"69",197280,201443,"She shrieks and calls out,but no actual dialogue.","Moana"
"70",201520,205889,"CLEMENTS: And now, we're into thetelling of the story with Gramma Tala,","Moana"
"71",205960,209646,"the wonderful actress,Rachel House from New Zealand.","Moana"
"72",209719,214203,"And she's actually somewhat youngerthan you would think.","Moana"
"73",214280,219445,"But she does a really fantastic jobof voicing Gramma Tala.","Moana"
"74",219520,221123,"MUSKER:And she does her singing as well.","Moana"
"75",221240,222889,"She's just an amazing actress.","Moana"
"76",222960,227009,"Um, again, this sets upthe plot engine of the movie.","Moana"
"77",227120,230203,"The destruction that's gonna comevisited to the Island of Motunui,","Moana"
"78",230280,232567,"which, by the way, is a made-up island.","Moana"
"79",232639,235723,"Paul Geraghty, our linguistics advisor,","Moana"
"80",235800,238723,"we asked him to come upwith some names of","Moana"
"81",238840,239887,"a fantastic island.","Moana"
"82",239960,243567,"We didn't want to set it in a real placelike Samoa, or Tonga, or Fiji.","Moana"
"83",243680,245169,"We really wanted to invent a place.","Moana"
"84",245240,247890,"And that was based on some advicewe got from our advisors","Moana"
"85",247960,251043,"that said""It's better not to localize it as much.""","Moana"
"86",251120,253201,"So, that island, Motunui, was invented.","Moana"
"87",253280,256362,"It means ""big island,"" I think,in a number of Pacific languages.","Moana"
"88",256439,260603,"CLEMENTS: And here's Chief Tui,voiced by Tem Morrison.","Moana"
"89",260680,263809,"Otherwise known as Boba Fett.","Moana"
"90",263879,266406,"- MUSKER: Jango Fett?- Jango Fett. Boba Fett.","Moana"
"91",266480,268528,"- He's a Star Wars guy.- MUSKER: Yeah.","Moana"
"92",268600,269839,"I'm gonna throw up.","Moana"
"93",270279,273887,"MUSKER: And that voiceis the son of Bérénice Robinson,","Moana"
"94",274000,275968,"our post-production supervisor,Maddox.","Moana"
"95",276040,279249,"I think that washis little contribution there.","Moana"
"96",279319,280889,"And the toddler,","Moana"
"97",280959,284884,"the little soundsthat the toddler makes, actually...","Moana"
"98",284959,289920,"Louise Aliberti, the daughterof Elise Aliberti, our assistant...","Moana"
"99",290000,291889,"Her nickname is Lou-Lou.","Moana"
"100",291959,295680,"So, some of this is library stuff,but some of the dialogue in this scene...","Moana"
"101",295759,298968,"- CLEMENTS: Most of it is Lou-Lou.- Yeah, it's Lou-Lou.","Moana"
"102",300040,302771,"CLEMENTS: The design of this toddleris so appealing,","Moana"
"103",302839,305524,"and a lot of thatis because of Bill Schwab,","Moana"
"104",305600,308524,"our brilliant art directorof character design,","Moana"
"105",308600,310807,"who brought so much appeal","Moana"
"106",310879,313041,"to the design ofall the characters in this movie.","Moana"
"107",313120,314848,"And he did a great job.","Moana"
"108",318399,320481,"CLEMENTS:This was all storyboarded.","Moana"
"109",320560,324485,"This and the next bit withlittle Moana meeting the ocean","Moana"
"110",324560,328723,"was all storyboardedby the great Chris Williams.","Moana"
"111",328800,333202,"A wonderful,wonderful storyboard artist, director,","Moana"
"112",333279,335009,"won an Academy Award","Moana"
"113",335079,338084,"along with Don Hall for Big Hero 6,and was a huge, huge...","Moana"
"114",338159,339764,"MUSKER: So, very early on,we just knew","Moana"
"115",339840,342683,"we wanted Moana to havea close relationship with the ocean.","Moana"
"116",342759,345569,"And even as the scriptwas even being developed,","Moana"
"117",345639,348449,"very early on, Chris,even before Big Hero 6,","Moana"
"118",348519,350362,"he storyboarded this sequence.","Moana"
"119",350439,352886,"Just really with,just a very sketchy idea.","Moana"
"120",352959,355850,"This is her first encounterwith the water as a toddler.","Moana"
"121",355920,359242,"And we knew we wanted to reallymake her believable as a toddler.","Moana"
"122",359319,360605,"So, we studied toddler animation,","Moana"
"123",360680,363603,"but even more so, we wanted to makethe ocean a character in the movie,","Moana"
"124",363680,365488,"which grew out of our researchin the Pacific Islands,","Moana"
"125",365560,367880,"where they talked about the oceanas if it were alive.","Moana"
"126",367959,369927,"CLEMENTS: Incidentally,the key to toddler animation","Moana"
"127",370000,372764,"is to animate the toddleras if she's drunk.","Moana"
"128",372839,375764,"And that works very well.","Moana"
"129",375839,377204,"MUSKER: Yeah, I think they tooka few of these scenes","Moana"
"130",377279,380170,"and they redid her as a 16-year-old,and it was scary, but...","Moana"
"131",380240,382401,"Actually, at one point,even this whole sequence was out","Moana"
"132",382480,384608,"and we had hermeeting the ocean for...","Moana"
"133",384680,386728,"This was happeningwhen she was 16 years old.","Moana"
"134",386800,388245,"For a while, it was in the story that way.","Moana"
"135",388319,390766,"But we always thought,""No, this is the better way to go.""","Moana"
"136",390839,392807,"And through variousstory machinations,","Moana"
"137",392879,394564,"it came back into the movie.Thank goodness.","Moana"
"138",394639,396290,"- CLEMENTS: We're happy that it did.- Yeah.","Moana"
"139",396360,399091,"CLEMENTS: This was a tour de forcefor our effects team.","Moana"
"140",399159,403528,"And, really, this was to prove outthe concept of the living ocean.","Moana"
"141",403600,405728,"How do you do it? It's not easy.","Moana"
"142",405840,408002,"MUSKER: It was the first sequencereally animated on the film.","Moana"
"143",408079,409923,"And, again, the effects department,","Moana"
"144",410000,413401,"they really had touse all these, sort of, engines,","Moana"
"145",413480,415766,"simulations of waterand combine them","Moana"
"146",415840,417603,"in waysthat had never been done before,","Moana"
"147",417680,420250,"in terms of all the refractions,reflections, the bubbles,","Moana"
"148",420319,423050,"the amplitude of these waves,the in and out of the surf,","Moana"
"149",423120,425360,"and the foam atthe bottom of the edge of these things,","Moana"
"150",425439,427442,"all this reallyhad to be carefully designed.","Moana"
"151",427519,429442,"CLEMENTS: But, really,they did just a great job.","Moana"
"152",429519,431329,"So, long beforethe rest of the movie was done,","Moana"
"153",431399,435199,"we had this little set piecethat we could show","Moana"
"154",435839,437841,"just as an example ofwhat the movie was gonna look like.","Moana"
"155",437920,440081,"And that really helped a lot","Moana"
"156",440160,442730,"in terms of just proving out the concept,","Moana"
"157",442800,446326,"and also just havinga nice, little sample.","Moana"
"158",446399,447889,"MUSKER: And we're gonna see...","Moana"
"159",447959,451442,"I mean, really, overall,the movie is so beautiful.","Moana"
"160",451519,453283,"And, Ian Gooding,our production designer,","Moana"
"161",453360,455600,"is really the one responsiblefor so much of that.","Moana"
"162",455680,459127,"He went to the islands.He's from Jamaica, originally, himself.","Moana"
"163",459199,460884,"But he took a bunch of pictures,","Moana"
"164",460959,462689,"and he really hasa wonderful eye for color","Moana"
"165",462759,464444,"and the richness of the color.","Moana"
"166",464519,466283,"CLEMENTS: Easter egg alert.","Moana"
"167",466399,467925,"MUSKER: We alwaysput a cameo of ourselves.","Moana"
"168",468000,470401,"We try to, in these movies,à la Alfred Hitchcock...","Moana"
"169",470480,472481,"And Ian Gooding came up...Watch very closely. Watch this rug.","Moana"
"170",472560,473891,"CLEMENTS: That was us.That's us going by.","Moana"
"171",473959,475882,"MUSKER: That's us right there.There we go. That's Ron and I...","Moana"
"172",475959,477961,"CLEMENTS: The skinny guy is Johnand the chubby guy is me.","Moana"
"173",478079,479081,"MUSKER: ...on that tapa.","Moana"
"174",479159,481480,"So, that was designedby Griselda Lemay,","Moana"
"175",481560,483324,"a wonderful storyboard artiston the movie,","Moana"
"176",483399,485528,"and visual development artist, really.","Moana"
"177",485600,488968,"And Ian found a way to sneak it in.Ian, our production designer.","Moana"
"178",489040,492521,"This whole song, the village song,came late in the process.","Moana"
"179",492600,496810,"CLEMENTS: In the middle, I would say.We didn't have it for a while.","Moana"
"180",496879,500201,"And this really was a way of village life","Moana"
"181",500279,505490,"of displaying a lot of the ideas aboutwhat a Pacific Island village is like.","Moana"
"182",505560,508643,"MUSKER: Right, becausewe had Moana going off,","Moana"
"183",508720,509880,"and she had to save her village.","Moana"
"184",509959,511610,"But we hadn't really shown muchof what was this life","Moana"
"185",511680,513250,"that she was really trying to save.","Moana"
"186",513320,515048,"And where we werereally celebrating Pacific culture","Moana"
"187",515159,517003,"the way we wanted to,having been there.","Moana"
"188",517120,519087,"And so, I really thinkit was John Lasseter's idea","Moana"
"189",519159,521447,"to really put some kind of songnear the beginning","Moana"
"190",521519,524922,"that really celebratedthe world of the movie,","Moana"
"191",525000,526683,"the world of the Pacific Islands.","Moana"
"192",526759,528046,"CLEMENTS: But also, the problem.","Moana"
"193",528120,531760,"The problem is inherentin the sense that there's conflict","Moana"
"194",531840,534446,"and that we know thatMoana is drawn to the sea,","Moana"
"195",534519,535931,"she's drawn to the ocean.","Moana"
"196",536000,539924,"And this clearly states thatthe chief has very opposed ideas","Moana"
"197",540000,542206,"that everything is great the way it is.","Moana"
"198",542279,545567,"""We're happy here in our village.There's no reason to ever leave.""","Moana"
"199",545639,547768,"MUSKER: Of course,we have our idiot rooster, Heihei,","Moana"
"200",547840,549443,"who got much stupideras the movie went on.","Moana"
"201",549519,551249,"Actually, he was in dangerof being cut at one point,","Moana"
"202",551360,554044,"because he just didn't seem to beadding enough humor to the movie.","Moana"
"203",554120,556407,"And Ryan Green,wonderful story artist...","Moana"
"204",556480,558562,"They all worked at,""How can we make him funnier?""","Moana"
"205",558639,561120,"And Ryan had the idea tomake him way, way stupider.","Moana"
"206",561200,562405,"And that helped enormously.","Moana"
"207",562480,565688,"And a bunch of gags ensuedthat played up his stupidity","Moana"
"208",565759,567602,"that, sort of, saved him in the movie.","Moana"
"209",567679,571923,"CLEMENTS: Yes, some people havecompared the little pig to me","Moana"
"210",572000,573683,"and the stupid chicken to John,","Moana"
"211",573799,579169,"which, I think, is, sort of,a valid kind of comparison.","Moana"
"212",579240,581082,"MUSKER: So, this scene,this is another one where, actually,","Moana"
"213",581159,583447,"John Lasseter had a hand in this,to his credit.","Moana"
"214",583559,586609,"We always struggled with,""How do we show Moana aging","Moana"
"215",586679,589411,"""from a young girl to the ageshe's gonna be in the movie?""","Moana"
"216",589480,592403,"And we tried it a million different waysand it never quite landed right.","Moana"
"217",592480,594447,"I do believe it was John's idea,who said,","Moana"
"218",594519,596601,"""Why don't you just cross-dissolvewhile she's dancing?""","Moana"
"219",596679,598364,"So, it shows the length and breadth","Moana"
"220",598440,600009,"of her relationshipwith her grandmother.","Moana"
"221",600120,603283,"And it celebrates the dancingand the cultural ideas at the same time.","Moana"
"222",603360,606442,"And I thinkit was a wonderful idea, visual...","Moana"
"223",606519,608522,"CLEMENTS: And we couldmention our choreographer.","Moana"
"224",608600,613162,"MUSKER: Yeah, yeah, Tiana, who...The group, Nonosina, that she has...","Moana"
"225",613240,614400,"We shot reference of her.","Moana"
"226",614480,617403,"I hope we see some of that,perhaps on this DVD.","Moana"
"227",617480,618845,"So, you can comparewhat the animators did.","Moana"
"228",618919,621650,"They borrowed elementsfrom her choreography","Moana"
"229",621720,623130,"and pasted them togetherin different ways.","Moana"
"230",623200,625441,"But it was really inspirationalin getting the dance.","Moana"
"231",625559,627961,"And that's been commented onby people from the Pacific Islands,","Moana"
"232",628039,630280,"how much they enjoyseeing the dance in this film.","Moana"
"233",630399,632562,"And Tiana did a fantastic job. Yeah.","Moana"
"234",633360,635567,"This is a sacred place.","Moana"
"235",635679,637921,"MUSKER: So, this was, I think,Jared Bush's invention, really,","Moana"
"236",638000,639081,"this pile of stones.","Moana"
"237",639200,641441,"It wasn't necessarily somethingwe saw in the Pacific Islands.","Moana"
"238",641519,642725,"But it felt island-y.","Moana"
"239",642799,646566,"We saw maraes, which are templesthat had stone foundations.","Moana"
"240",646639,648802,"So, in a way,this alluded to that a little bit.","Moana"
"241",648879,653681,"But it was a way of trying to create avisual symbol of the power of the past","Moana"
"242",653759,657525,"that she was meant to connect with,and her role and her responsibility.","Moana"
"243",657600,660365,"And I think it was a good visual deviceto, sort of, highlight that,","Moana"
"244",660440,663205,"that comes into the moviein a few different places.","Moana"
"245",663279,665850,"Jared did an amazing jobin the last year of the movie,","Moana"
"246",665919,669048,"really, sort of, helping pasteeverything together and great dialogue.","Moana"
"247",669120,672043,"And he reallywas a godsend for the movie.","Moana"
"248",672120,674600,"CLEMENTS: And in terms of Moana,the character of Moana,","Moana"
"249",674679,677763,"I think really pushing this conflict","Moana"
"250",677840,680730,"that she loves her island,she loves her people.","Moana"
"251",680799,685361,"She doesn't necessarilywanna run away, or anything like that.","Moana"
"252",685440,687043,"She feels a commitment.","Moana"
"253",687120,690363,"But she still does feelthis call to the sea,","Moana"
"254",690440,692363,"and she can't resolve these two.","Moana"
"255",692440,694966,"And here's another nice dance bit.","Moana"
"256",695039,697884,"MUSKER: Yeah, again, John Lasseter...But we had another scene here.","Moana"
"257",697960,699849,"And he's like, ""No, let's do dancing.I want more dancing.""","Moana"
"258",699919,702889,"So, we added more dancing.Now, she's wearing here, actually...","Moana"

"269",729320,732767,"I know you recognize his voice.There he is, that long-haired guy.","Moana"
"270",732840,735285,"And, in fact,the hair was based on Troy's hair.","Moana"
"271",735360,736645,"We studied Troy's hair","Moana"
"272",736720,739245,"when we were lookingfor long Polynesian locks","Moana"
"273",739320,742846,"for some of the men in the movie,and he was an inspiration.","Moana"
"274",743080,745480,"CLEMENTS: And he dida great voice job, too.","Moana"
"275",745559,747323,"MUSKER: Of course, tattooing issuch a part of the culture.","Moana"
"276",747399,749129,"When we went there five years ago,","Moana"
"277",749200,752009,"Jessica Julius, one ofour development executives,","Moana"
"278",752080,754686,"was with us,and she got a tattoo, traditional style.","Moana"

"282",760840,764447,"when we were at the PasifikaMusic Festival in March of2014.","Moana"
"283",764519,767568,"There was a band... Or a dance groupon the Samoan stage,","Moana"
"284",767639,769768,"where there was a lead dancerwho just went wild,","Moana"
"285",769840,773525,"he was a bit theChris Farley/John Belushi of Samoa.","Moana"
"286",773600,775761,"And we loved his dancing so much,we said,","Moana"
"287",775840,777284,"""Have that little kid dance like he did.""","Moana"
"288",777360,779043,"So, the animatorlooked at some of the reference","Moana"
"289",779120,780405,"and took a little bit of a cue.","Moana"
"290",780480,782163,"That was Andrew Chesworthwho animated that.","Moana"
"291",782240,783480,"Great job by Andrew.","Moana"
"292",783559,786722,"CLEMENTS: And we should mentionAlan Tudyk who did the voice of Heihei,","Moana"

"294",788080,793041,"Also did the voice of this old guywho wants to eat Heihei.","Moana"
"295",793120,794769,"So, there's a nice yin-yang there","Moana"

"297",797720,799721,"- were voiced by the same person.- MUSKER: And speaking of voices,","Moana"
"298",799799,803929,"this particular voice is the voiceof Auli'i Cravalho's mother, Puanani.","Moana"
"299",804000,805524,"She's actually doing the voice here.","Moana"
"300",805600,807044,"John Lasseter was big on,","Moana"
"301",807159,809207,"""Let's give her a cameo in the movieif we can somewhere.""","Moana"
"302",809279,810566,"And we had herin a few different spots.","Moana"
"303",810639,812085,"Ultimately, we wound up on this spot.","Moana"
"304",812159,813684,"So, when she says,""She's doing great, ""","Moana"
"305",813759,815171,"which she's about to say.","Moana"
"306",815240,816365,"CLEMENTS: There's an extrameaning to that.","Moana"

"313",828399,830288,"But Auli'i Cravalho,after an exhaustive search,","Moana"
"314",830360,832488,"you'll see some of that,perhaps on this DVD.","Moana"
"315",832600,834523,"She did an unbelievable job,all the acting, all the singing.","Moana"

"329",872240,875049,"CLEMENTS:And Taika was great to work with","Moana"
"330",875120,877850,"in the early part of the process.","Moana"
"331",877919,880399,"He did write the first draft.","Moana"
"332",880480,882607,"And he camefrom Flight of the Conchords","Moana"

"340",905879,907688,"MUSKER: Nicole Scherzinger,who is actually","Moana"

"342",909960,911849,"Mom was in and outof the story many times.","Moana"
"343",911919,913808,"She was in most of our first drafts.","Moana"
"344",913879,916610,"And then, for about a year,I think, she may have left the movie.","Moana"
"345",916679,918010,"And then she reappeared again.","Moana"
"346",918080,919730,"Fortunately, we're happythat she came back.","Moana"
"347",919799,921164,"CLEMENTS: We alwayswanted Mom to be in here.","Moana"

"352",929360,930770,"MUSKER: Yeah.","Moana"
"353",930840,934764,"In this night scene, we reallywanted to give a backstory to Dad,","Moana"
"354",934840,936763,"as far as, ""Why is heso dead-set against voyaging?""","Moana"
"355",936840,938250,"So, there were variations of this scene.","Moana"
"356",938320,941051,"Earlier drafts had him actuallytelling Moana what happened.","Moana"
"357",941120,943963,"But, again, I don't mean to keepmentioning John Lasseter.","Moana"
"358",944039,947123,"But I do believe it was his idea.""Have Mom tell this story.""","Moana"
"359",947200,950488,"Because it's almost likethere's a good cop, bad cop thing.","Moana"
"360",950559,955407,"And she could relay itmore sympathetically in a way","Moana"
"361",955480,957721,"from Dad's point of view,for her to deliver it.","Moana"
"362",957799,959211,"And Moana's shocked to hear this.","Moana"
"363",959279,960485,"She's never heard any of this before.","Moana"
"364",960559,962767,"But now,understands her father a little better.","Moana"
"365",962840,964763,"But it doesn't help herwith her basic problem","Moana"
"366",964840,967889,"and she's about to sing this song,How Far I'll Go.","Moana"
"367",967960,971043,"CLEMENTS: It's, sort of,a classic ""I Want"" song.","Moana"
"368",971120,973407,"Again, there's parallels, I think.","Moana"
"369",973919,975570,"But Lin-Manuel Miranda,","Moana"
"370",975639,980806,"brilliant, brilliant composer, lyricist.","Moana"
"371",980879,984043,"Very big fan of Howard Ashmanand the work of Howard Ashman.","Moana"
"372",984120,989047,"And, I think, really felt that hewanted to do a classic ""I Want"" song.","Moana"
"373",989120,990485,"MUSKER:We struggled a little bit with","Moana"
"374",990559,991890,"where this was gonna comein the story.","Moana"
"375",991960,993563,"There were timeswhere it came earlier,","Moana"
"376",993679,995807,"and there were times whereit had a different slant.","Moana"
"377",995879,998120,"And, ultimately, I think,","Moana"
"378",998200,1001283,"it was better to comeon the heels of some kind of setback.","Moana"
"379",1001360,1003726,"And that's what werearranged the story to make happen.","Moana"
"380",1003799,1007282,"So, this whole run-in withher father there prompts the song,","Moana"
"381",1007399,1009562,"which just seemsto make it work better.","Moana"
"382",1009639,1013928,"And it features a wonderful animationby our amazing animation staff","Moana"

"389",1029279,1030326,"CLEMENTS: It's true.","Moana"
"390",1030400,1033768,"But we had never workedwith most of the animators on this film","Moana"

"393",1041240,1043560,"MUSKER: Yeah, the overall level isjust amazing on this.","Moana"
"394",1043640,1047963,"Now, here's another Easter egg.That piece of tapa","Moana"
"395",1048039,1052203,"is almost like a vague caricatureof the carpet in Aladdin.","Moana"
"396",1052319,1054322,"If you look at the pattern,the way it's laid out...","Moana"
"397",1054400,1056721,"CLEMENTS: You haveto look at it carefully.","Moana"

"399",1057960,1060201,"CLEMENTS: You don't wantEaster eggs to be too easy.","Moana"
"400",1060279,1062169,"But now, we're giving them away.","Moana"

"403",1065960,1068530,"MUSKER: So, this is, sort of,the crux of this song, basically,","Moana"

"405",1071640,1073688,"her responsibilitiesand her pull to the sea.","Moana"
"406",1073799,1075086,"And we tried to physicalize that","Moana"
"407",1075160,1078403,"by having her move inlandas she was drawn to the land,","Moana"
"408",1078480,1081689,"and then back out to the screen right,which is where the ocean is.","Moana"
"409",1081759,1084080,"So, all the movement nowgoes from left to right","Moana"
"410",1084160,1086640,"as she is thinking,""This is what my real pull is.""","Moana"
"411",1086720,1089165,"And she goes past herceremonial headdress.","Moana"
"412",1089240,1091241,"CLEMENTS: And we got blowholesin the movie, which,","Moana"

"502",1324240,1326446,"I think it might have been Ron's ideato hold this off","Moana"
"503",1326519,1329410,"so that it was a secretthat was being kept from her,","Moana"
"504",1329480,1331243,"the fact that they were once voyagers.","Moana"
"505",1331319,1333321,"And so,we got this really dramatic scene","Moana"

"507",1337599,1339250,"What is all this voyaging about?","Moana"

"510",1344440,1346646,"CLEMENTS: Yeah, and that was oneof the big takeaways","Moana"
"511",1346720,1351362,"from the Pacific Islands,was the culture of navigation,","Moana"
"512",1351440,1354090,"that they were the greatest navigatorsthe world has ever known.","Moana"

"518",1365119,1367201,"that is when they started up again.","Moana"
"519",1367279,1370886,"And the idea was that possibly,in our minds,","Moana"
"520",1370960,1372200,"that the reason things stopped","Moana"
"521",1372279,1375363,"was because of the actionsof this trickster demigod,","Moana"

"533",1401400,1403242,"But it has to do with nature,","Moana"

"544",1442640,1444449,"I think it literally means""You can do it.""","Moana"

"676",1788920,1790968,"This is, sort of,a Joseph Campbell type moment,","Moana"

"703",1850920,1852569,"there was always a reprise here.","Moana"
"704",1852640,1855040,"But there were questions,which part of it would be sung on stage","Moana"

"706",1857720,1860690,"At one point, this got cut shorterand Mom was barely in this.","Moana"
"707",1860759,1862887,"Fortunately, I think,we restored it to these scenes","Moana"

"718",1889440,1891363,"this celebration...We heard about animal totems","Moana"

"732",1926720,1928926,"we thought we gotta exploit thatfor the movie.","Moana"
"733",1929000,1931048,"And here, this, we struggled over this.This is based on the real...","Moana"

"737",1940440,1943522,"but that's roughly the orientation of itin the Southern Hemisphere.","Moana"
"738",1943640,1944800,"But we added more stars","Moana"

"740",1948359,1951728,"Now, this kind of funny introductionof Heihei went way back,","Moana"

"876",2294599,2296329,"Kind of a mock brag.","Moana"
"877",2296400,2297889,"Once we got to this point","Moana"
"878",2297960,2300804,"where Maui was a little bit morevillainous at the beginning,","Moana"
"879",2300880,2302688,"and he had to show,""Hey, I'm a good guy, ""","Moana"
"880",2302760,2306844,"Lin ran with it so fast and recorded it.","Moana"
"881",2306920,2309001,"The first demo we heard of thiswas Lin himself.","Moana"
"882",2309079,2311003,"And of course there'sa big rap section in the middle,","Moana"
"883",2311119,2312644,"which was a tour de force for Lin","Moana"

"885",2314400,2315844,"CLEMENTS:And there was always confidence","Moana"

"887",2319440,2321487,"And he was eager to do this song.","Moana"

"889",2323079,2326641,"MUSKER: The great Mack Kablan,our animation supervisor on Maui,","Moana"
"890",2326760,2328523,"and helped reallypull all this stuff together","Moana"
"891",2328599,2330920,"and did some of the scenesduring this song. Amazing animation.","Moana"
"892",2331000,2333480,"And you saw a little glimpseof Mini Maui there,","Moana"
"893",2333599,2335329,"who came alongas the story developed,","Moana"
"894",2335400,2337322,"animated by Eric Goldberg.","Moana"
"895",2337400,2341643,"It was a wonderful device to undercutthe pomposity of the character,","Moana"

"897",2344800,2347246,"and actually tookmore of a liking to Moana.","Moana"
"898",2347320,2349003,"So, in a way, there werethree characters in this scene,","Moana"
"899",2349079,2350684,"or four, if you count the ocean.","Moana"

"904",2361000,2363844,"The hair on this is amazing.","Moana"

"906",2367159,2370050,"As we say, Maui was once bald,","Moana"
"907",2370119,2373362,"and it was a complicationto the budget of the movie","Moana"

"909",2375400,2376686,"The necklace is very complicated","Moana"
"910",2376760,2378045,"and the same people who did the hair","Moana"
"911",2378119,2379724,"had to do all the little movementsof the necklace,","Moana"
"912",2379800,2380880,"which, at one point, we thought,","Moana"
"913",2380960,2382530,"""We're not gonna be ableto do it in the movie.""","Moana"
"914",2382599,2384409,"So, if you notice, he doesn't havea necklace in this scene.","Moana"
"915",2384480,2386402,"We had him take off the necklace,and at one point,","Moana"
"916",2386480,2388369,"he was never gonna get it back.","Moana"
"917",2388440,2390840,"And then we really missedthe necklace and we said, ""Can't we?""","Moana"

"919",2392480,2394322,"- ""No, we can do the necklace.""- They figured out how to do it.","Moana"
"920",2394400,2396128,"MUSKER: So, the next scene,when you see him on the boat,","Moana"
"921",2396199,2397360,"he's got a necklace again","Moana"

"1439",3670440,3671929,"we really wanted to channel that,","Moana"

"1484",3786039,3788804,"And manhandling Maui, it was fun,'cause Lin said...","Moana"
"1485",3788880,3790847,"He thought of thisas his answer to Les Poissons,","Moana"
"1486",3790920,3792489,"the song from Little Mermaid,","Moana"
"1487",3792599,3795682,"where there's a crab who getssadistically manhandled by a guy.","Moana"
"1488",3795760,3797922,"Here's a scene where a demigod","Moana"
"1489",3798000,3799842,"gets sadistically manhandledby a crab.","Moana"
"1490",3799920,3801809,"It was turning it in reverse.","Moana"
"1491",3801880,3806601,"It was fun for him to do his owncock-eyed homage to Les Poissons.","Moana"
"1492",3807079,3810322,"I think Normand Lemaystoryboarded this, did an amazing job.","Moana"
"1493",3810400,3812641,"He's nominated for an Anniefor his work on this.","Moana"
"1494",3812719,3816166,"And this whole black light idea,I think, was his,","Moana"
"1495",3816239,3819800,"when the shell closes and suddenly,we go into a whole black light world.","Moana"
"1496",3819920,3821684,"It was really fun for the lightersand for us","Moana"
"1497",3821760,3825206,"to look at, ""How can we stage this now,in this limited thing.""","Moana"
"1498",3826559,3829369,"Joey Brown's funny animationon the strumming there.","Moana"
"1499",3833360,3837159,"Yeah, now we start to allude a little bitto Maui's backstory.","Moana"
"1500",3837239,3840130,"In earlier versions,we always had some allusions to","Moana"
"1501",3840199,3841530,"that there was more to Mauithan met the eye","Moana"
"1502",3841599,3843568,"that we got into in this underworld.","Moana"
"1503",3843639,3846449,"And this was a good way of doing itwithin the song,","Moana"
"1504",3846519,3848726,"where we hint just slightly at itand it will be explained","Moana"
"1505",3848800,3850563,"much more thoroughly later.","Moana"
"1506",3850639,3854360,"In the meantime, we just beat Maui upas much as possible.","Moana"
"1507",3854440,3856010,"CLEMENTS:We wanted this to be painful.","Moana"
"1508",3856119,3857884,"MUSKER: It's kind of like a prizefightthat he's losing.","Moana"
"1509",3857960,3859802,"And we had different versions.","Moana"
"1510",3859880,3862804,"But we liked the ideaof really reducing him,","Moana"
"1511",3862920,3866719,"really having him on the short end,of making him more vulnerable.","Moana"
"1512",3866840,3869570,"CLEMENTS: You noticedTamatoa's eyes are different colors?","Moana"
"1513",3869639,3874168,"MUSKER: Yes, that's a little homage toa certain rock and roll persona.","Moana"
"1514",3879000,3880161,"- MOANA: Hey!- Huh?","Moana"
"1515",3880880,3882847,"I got something shiny for ya!","Moana"
"1516",3886079,3887969,"MUSKER: These are some adlibsof Jemaine, I think.","Moana"

"1518",3890000,3892570,"Oh, you can.You keep surprising me.","Moana"
"1519",3892960,3896487,"MUSKER: Jemaine has a way ofmaking the obvious seem funny.","Moana"
"1520",3897320,3898320,"(YELLS)","Moana"
"1521",3898440,3902889,"And so, now we really wanted topull a reversal on the audience,","Moana"
"1522",3903000,3905969,"and yet, have them buythat she tricked the crab.","Moana"
"1523",3906039,3909168,"Just like the audience has beena little bit deceived by all this.","Moana"
"1524",3909239,3912005,"And put her in the driver seat,it's really her saving Maui.","Moana"
"1525",3912079,3914811,"It's fun to seeher saving the supposed demigod.","Moana"
"1526",3914880,3916768,"That she's really got to pull him out.","Moana"
"1527",3916840,3920003,"It gives him a little more respect for herand it pulls them together more.","Moana"
"1528",3920079,3923561,"That she's the one that reallyrescues him from this jam.","Moana"
"1529",3923639,3926768,"CLEMENTS: That's probably one ofthe last scenes animated in the movie.","Moana"
"1530",3926840,3928568,"MUSKER: Yeah.","Moana"
"1531",3928639,3931449,"And these geysers we used there,they became a device","Moana"
"1532",3931519,3934648,"to get them both quicklyup to the water's surface.","Moana"
"1533",3934719,3938280,"So that we didn't have to spendas much time doing that.","Moana"
"1534",3938360,3940248,"So much for Tamatoa.","Moana"
"1535",3940320,3942447,"And Jason Hand","Moana"
"1536",3942519,3944806,"storyboarded this scene coming up,the whole half-shark thing,","Moana"
"1537",3945239,3948608,"did hilarious drawings, very funny,that really,","Moana"
"1538",3948679,3951809,"this is one of the comic highlightswithin the middle of the movie.","Moana"
"1539",3951880,3954963,"Storyboard drawn by the artist,and then the animation, Abe Aguilar.","Moana"
"1540",3955039,3958123,"Hilarious, great animation.And Mack Kablan, very...","Moana"
"1541",3958199,3961443,"The more underplayed it was,the more funny it was, really.","Moana"
"1542",3961559,3964608,"CLEMENTS: Also, her reactionsare really fun on this, too.","Moana"
"1543",3964679,3966728,"MUSKER: Yeah, and Nicolas,his animations as well.","Moana"
"1544",3966800,3969485,"Yeah, and Daniel Peixe didsome of her reactions there.","Moana"
"1545",3969559,3972802,"Which are just...And Michael Klim, great work.","Moana"
"1546",3972880,3974563,"Look, the point is...","Moana"
"1547",3974719,3977610,"for a little girl, child, thing,whatever...","Moana"
"1548",3977679,3978965,"MUSKER:Yeah, just this incidental thing.","Moana"
"1549",3979039,3981168,"Yeah, I think that was Abe's animation,as I recall.","Moana"
"1550",3981239,3983641,"Yeah, just a really fun little detail...","Moana"
"1551",3983719,3985210,"CLEMENTS: Yeah,this was a fun scene, too...","Moana"
"1552",3985280,3986327,"MUSKER: Yeah.","Moana"
"1553",3986400,3987400,"Yeah.","Moana"
"1554",3988159,3991925,"And they had to model him...It's a question of ""How did they do it?""","Moana"
"1555",3992000,3994367,"We saw some scenes,if you took that shark head away,","Moana"
"1556",3994440,3995646,"they actually took Maui,the rest of his body,","Moana"
"1557",3995760,3998081,"and shrunk it down really tiny,so you'd see, like,","Moana"
"1558",3998159,3999730,"a tiny little head of Mauiunderneath that shark head.","Moana"
"1559",3999800,4001005,"CLEMENTS: It was scary.They should put it out...","Moana"
"1560",4001079,4002969,"MUSKER: You don't wanna seewhat's really underneath that.","Moana"
"1561",4003039,4005327,"CLEMENTS: They are some ofthe scariest outtakes I've ever seen.","Moana"
"1562",4005400,4007686,"- MUSKER: I was very disturbed.- Yeah, some of the movies...","Moana"
"1563",4007760,4011559,"Hand-drawn films don't get that scarywhen things go wrong.","Moana"
"1564",4011639,4012641,"MUSKER: Yeah.","Moana"
"1565",4014480,4017768,"Again, it was fun to do a comic visual","Moana"
"1566",4017840,4019922,"set piece like this in the middle,and now, we...","Moana"
"1567",4020000,4023003,"This scene starts joke-yand then it's gonna turn more serious.","Moana"
"1568",4023119,4026329,"- It's a bonding sort of scene.- CLEMENTS: It's another John Ripa...","Moana"
"1569",4026400,4029369,"MUSKER: Yeah, John Ripa did such anamazing job of the boards on this.","Moana"
"1570",4029440,4032648,"And Bert Klein, very funny animationcoming up here, with this...","Moana"
"1571",4034960,4036199,"Multi-creatures.","Moana"
"1572",4036880,4038405,"And, of course, Maui,","Moana"
"1573",4038480,4040208,"you see his hair's tied upin his man bun.","Moana"
"1574",4040280,4041360,"I've seen comments on this.","Moana"
"1575",4041440,4043168,"People really liked thatin her as well.","Moana"
"1576",4043239,4046050,"That was driven at least in partby production issues where,","Moana"
"1577",4046119,4048168,"it became easier to animate the hairif it was tied up.","Moana"
"1578",4048239,4050208,"But it really is true to the culture, too.","Moana"
"1579",4050280,4052851,"So, a lot of girls I've seen,really relate to the idea","Moana"
"1580",4052920,4054206,"that she would tie up her hair.","Moana"
"1581",4054320,4056083,"Auli'i used to do thatduring the recording sessions,","Moana"
"1582",4056159,4058606,"if it got in her way,very effortlessly did that.","Moana"
"1583",4058679,4060250,"So, it was fun doing it with herand him as well.","Moana"
"1584",4060320,4062447,"- CLEMENTS: Within seconds.- Yeah.","Moana"
"1585",4062519,4065568,"And all these tattoos on his body,Mac George designed these tattoos.","Moana"
"1586",4065639,4067403,"Bill Schwab had a hand in it.","Moana"
"1587",4067480,4069561,"We wanted them to tell a story,","Moana"
"1588",4069639,4072166,"they are based on Marquesanand other real tattoos.","Moana"
"1589",4072239,4074402,"And this one is, sort of, the key one,","Moana"
"1590",4074480,4077528,"that really tellsthe backstory of his whole...","Moana"
"1591",4077599,4079840,"CLEMENTS:This is based on real mythology.","Moana"
"1592",4079920,4081409,"This backstory of Maui.","Moana"
"1593",4081480,4083925,"There are many different versionsof the Maui stories.","Moana"
"1594",4084000,4086684,"Which we found out that","Moana"
"1595",4086760,4090764,"every island has their own versionof the Maui stories.","Moana"
"1596",4090840,4093320,"And many islands think thatthey're unique.","Moana"
"1597",4093440,4095362,"That he, Maui, totally belongs to them.","Moana"
"1598",4095440,4096770,"But, really, he's a demigod,","Moana"
"1599",4096840,4099889,"and his stories are toldthroughout the Pacific Islands.","Moana"
"1600",4101680,4104286,"MUSKER: Again, we tried to threadthe ocean through some of these shots","Moana"
"1601",4104359,4107603,"so that the ocean is still alive,but a bit in the background.","Moana"
"1602",4107680,4109363,"But now,comes this really intimate scene","Moana"
"1603",4109439,4111966,"where she lets down her guard,he lets down his guard.","Moana"
"1604",4112039,4114280,"It's really a crucial scenefor pulling the two of them together.","Moana"
"1605",4114359,4118251,"Wonderful acting, Andrew Lawson,here in this shot, the animator.","Moana"
"1606",4118359,4123082,"And they really had to dig intothe acting on this, on both characters.","Moana"
"1607",4123159,4125447,"Maui really isn't doing muchon his scenes.","Moana"
"1608",4125520,4127283,"He's nearly immobileon a lot of these shots.","Moana"
"1609",4127359,4130523,"But it was really important to gethis thought process,","Moana"
"1610",4130600,4134127,"and the emotion in these scenes.And they did a terrific job.","Moana"
"1611",4134199,4137841,"As well as the lighting,Chris Springfield was involved","Moana"
"1612",4137920,4140240,"in getting all these scenes lit.","Moana"
"1613",4140319,4143005,"And really making them feellike they reflect the mood,","Moana"
"1614",4143079,4145242,"this somber mood.","Moana"
"1615",4146319,4150211,"And yet, some warmth in the sky'cause it's a warm, yet somber scene.","Moana"
"1616",4150279,4154604,"So, they found, I think,just the right color palette for this.","Moana"
"1617",4154680,4157649,"CLEMENTS: It still surprises me thatsome people find it hard to understand","Moana"
"1618",4157720,4162168,"that animators are primarily actors.They are really good actors.","Moana"
"1619",4162239,4166722,"And the animators we hadon this movie were excellent actors.","Moana"
"1620",4166800,4171328,"And along with all the technicalknowledge they have to have,","Moana"
"1621",4171399,4175041,"primarily, they have to be able to act.","Moana"
"1622",4175119,4177009,"MAUI: They gave me the hook.","Moana"
"1623",4177439,4178805,"They made me...","Moana"
"1624",4179439,4180770,"Maui.","Moana"
"1625",4181520,4184649,"MUSKER: Yeah, and Dwayne's deliveryon this sequence was so great.","Moana"
"1626",4184720,4186847,"We had to record it a couple of times","Moana"
"1627",4186920,4188729,"just because there weresome little rewrites here and there,","Moana"
"1628",4188800,4189961,"but every time he did it,","Moana"
"1629",4190079,4192082,"he just gotso much into the heart of this.","Moana"
"1630",4192159,4195641,"And I'd seen Dwayne do some stuffeven on his TV show, Ballers,","Moana"
"1631",4195720,4197529,"that I thoughtwas really sensitively acted,","Moana"
"1632",4197600,4200171,"I think he's a really good actor,though he doesn't get credit for it.","Moana"
"1633",4200239,4203050,"And then a lot of the movies don'treally demand much of him, I think.","Moana"
"1634",4203119,4204201,"He's capable of it all.","Moana"
"1635",4204279,4206043,"CLEMENTS: They don't demanda lot of sensitive acting.","Moana"
"1636",4206119,4209601,"- They demand a lot of action, heroic...- MUSKER: Others kills...","Moana"
"1637",4209680,4211091,"But I'm more happy that we had","Moana"
"1638",4211159,4213162,"both the action-y stuffand these subtle things.","Moana"
"1639",4213239,4215128,"Jeff Engel did this long, long scene.One of the last to be...","Moana"
"1640",4215199,4217725,"CLEMENTS: This is the longest scenein the movie, actually.","Moana"
"1641",4217800,4220121,"MUSKER: This is the longest,this might be 40 seconds long.","Moana"
"1642",4220199,4222965,"And it's just the two of them,and it all relies on the acting.","Moana"
"1643",4223039,4225407,"And all the little subtle eye darts,","Moana"
"1644",4225479,4227960,"and he opens his mouthand he thinks...","Moana"
"1645",4228039,4230565,"For any of youanimation students out there,","Moana"
"1646",4230640,4232243,"you could really look at this sceneof him and his...","Moana"
"1647",4232319,4236404,"It's just a marvel, and justunderstated reaction, and process...","Moana"
"1648",4236479,4238881,"CLEMENTS: He's not saying anything,he's just thinking.","Moana"
"1649",4238960,4240041,"MUSKER: Yeah.","Moana"
"1650",4240119,4241564,"CLEMENTS: That's just trying to showthe audience...","Moana"
"1651",4241640,4243881,"MUSKER: Of course, we had to distorthis anatomy there a little bit,","Moana"
"1652",4243960,4245927,"so you could get the feelingthat he would hug, so...","Moana"
"1653",4246239,4248402,"A great team of peoplereally conspired to,","Moana"
"1654",4248479,4249765,"""How do we make that skin move?""","Moana"
"1655",4249840,4253765,"I think tech animation ultimately doesthat, where they deform his body.","Moana"
"1656",4253840,4256207,"Now, this, earlier, for a while,","Moana"
"1657",4256279,4258168,"had a different underscore cuebehind it.","Moana"
"1658",4258239,4260402,"It was a reprise of theYou're Welcome song.","Moana"
"1659",4260479,4263449,"But it sounded too brassy,like it didn't fit.","Moana"
"1660",4263520,4265761,"And I really felt like,this song that I knew,","Moana"
"1661",4265840,4270448,"which we had actually usedas a scratch for...","Moana"
"1662",4270520,4273204,"For a trailer that we had,it's a Te Vaka song.","Moana"
"1663",4273279,4275122,"And we loved the spirit of thisand the energy.","Moana"
"1664",4275199,4276439,"It's just so infectious,","Moana"
"1665",4276520,4280444,"that we said this would be a betterbackdrop for this montage-y sequence.","Moana"
"1666",4280520,4283126,"So, we reinstated thisvery late in the process.","Moana"
"1667",4283199,4284963,"And so, this is really...","Moana"
"1668",4285039,4288487,"CLEMENTS: This is one of the lastsequences to be done as well.","Moana"
"1669",4288560,4292804,"MUSKER: But it's so bright, and so fun,and it's part of Opetaia's talent","Moana"
"1670",4292880,4295770,"that he can do the emotional stuff,","Moana"
"1671",4295840,4298764,"but then the light, fun stuffis just as great.","Moana"

"1678",4314600,4318764,"to really put the ideas over,it's all got to be visually told.","Moana"
"1679",4318840,4322002,"The weight of this, and the wake,and the way the boat moves...","Moana"
"1680",4322079,4324002,"It's just,you take all this stuff for granted,","Moana"

"1686",4333960,4336087,"This is one of the thingsthat was added, which was great.","Moana"
"1687",4336159,4338845,"And then John Lasseter really said,""Push, push, push.""","Moana"
"1688",4338920,4341490,"Really make the oceaneven more upset and furious.","Moana"
"1689",4341560,4343561,"And he really pushed usto go even broader with it,","Moana"
"1690",4343640,4345368,"which did make it funnier.","Moana"
"1691",4345439,4348329,"And this whole exchange of the oar,this is really a symbolic thing,","Moana"
"1692",4348399,4349765,"""Okay, you take over.""","Moana"
"1693",4349840,4352729,"It really is a passing of the batonin their relationship.","Moana"
"1694",4352800,4356122,"And as I said, one point, it almosthappened earlier, and it was too early.","Moana"
"1695",4356199,4358770,"This seemed like the right spotfor this to happen.","Moana"
"1696",4358840,4360489,"CLEMENTS:Nice to get a happy scene here.","Moana"
"1697",4360560,4362528,"MUSKER: Wanted to get some warmthbetween them.","Moana"
"1698",4362600,4365604,"CLEMENTS: But things aregoing to turn fairly unhappy soon.","Moana"
"1699",4365680,4367603,"- And stay that way for a long time.- MUSKER: Yeah, basically...","Moana"
"1700",4367680,4369569,"The end of this shot, and thebeginning of these next scenes,","Moana"
"1701",4369640,4370640,"is them at their warmest","Moana"
"1702",4370760,4371761,"because now, things are gonna...","Moana"
"1703",4372279,4375123,"Yeah, tension is gonna come backinto the story.","Moana"
"1704",4375199,4378601,"But this, we wanted the maximumof their being pulled together.","Moana"
"1705",4378680,4380204,"Of course, we love the idea of fog,","Moana"
"1706",4380279,4383886,"and it was a way of being able to givethe island of Te Fiti a reveal.","Moana"
"1707",4383960,4385609,"So, you don't see it at first.","Moana"
"1708",4385680,4387170,"It is a real part of the atmosphere,","Moana"
"1709",4387239,4389527,"and the Pacific fog issuch a part of sailing.","Moana"
"1710",4389600,4392921,"It became a theatrical device for us,that we enjoyed using.","Moana"
"1711",4393000,4394967,"- CLEMENTS: Of course.- And the hair again...","Moana"
"1712",4395039,4396769,"The breeze throughthe hair, unbelievable.","Moana"
"1713",4396840,4399649,"CLEMENTS: And this scenewas explaining something","Moana"
"1714",4399720,4403690,"that I think was always in the movie,but maybe not clear.","Moana"
"1715",4403760,4406729,"That the ocean has an agendain this movie.","Moana"
"1716",4406800,4409962,"And that was based on somethingwe heard in the South Pacific.","Moana"
"1717",4410039,4412884,"Which was that the oceandoesn't separate the islands,","Moana"
"1718",4412960,4416645,"it actually unites themalmost like one continent.","Moana"
"1719",4416720,4418801,"So, the idea through the whole movie,","Moana"
"1720",4418880,4423726,"is that the ocean really wantsto heal this problem,","Moana"
"1721",4423800,4426167,"so that the islandscan all be united again.","Moana"
"1722",4426239,4430369,"And the ocean is actuallysupporting the migration.","Moana"
"1723",4431800,4433722,"MUSKER: It was Taika that namedthe island Te Fiti,","Moana"
"1724",4433800,4434926,"back in his earlier script.","Moana"
"1725",4435000,4437287,"And it actually means""The East,"" I think,","Moana"
"1726",4437359,4439726,"and it relates almost to Tahiti.","Moana"
"1727",4439800,4441689,"And we always thoughtthat this was almost...","Moana"
"1728",4441760,4444286,"This is set in the storybefore Tahiti was ever discovered.","Moana"
"1729",4444359,4447443,"So, in some ways, Te Fiti is Tahiti,a little bit.","Moana"
"1730",4447520,4449601,"Lighting departmentalways had to figure out","Moana"
"1731",4449680,4451648,"how bright and how dim to make this,","Moana"
"1732",4451720,4453961,"the heart of Te Fiti,'cause it would pulse more","Moana"
"1733",4454039,4455166,"the closer it gets to the island.","Moana"
"1734",4455239,4457128,"I don't know if you're aware of that,but as you watch,","Moana"
"1735",4457199,4460090,"it gets brighteras they get closer to the island.","Moana"
"1736",4460159,4464881,"And neck wrench, courtesy ofChris Williams' storyboards here.","Moana"
"1737",4464960,4468680,"A wonderful personality ideato work into that beat.","Moana"
"1738",4468760,4470284,"And...","Moana"
"1739",4470399,4473801,"CLEMENTS: And this was done earlier,I think.","Moana"
"1740",4474880,4478362,"This is an effects kind of tour de force.","Moana"
"1741",4478439,4480442,"MUSKER: Yeah, it's amazinghow complicated these shots are.","Moana"
"1742",4480520,4481645,"You take them for granted,","Moana"
"1743",4481720,4483529,"but there's smoke elements,there's fire elements,","Moana"
"1744",4483600,4485011,"there's ash elements.","Moana"
"1745",4485079,4488481,"There's Te Kā herself,who has several elements.","Moana"
"1746",4488560,4492280,"Including the dripping lava,and the cracks, and all that.","Moana"
"1747",4492359,4496159,"And then the fire for her hair,and the smoke and it just...","Moana"
"1748",4498920,4501445,"This was great to explorethe lighting underwater here,","Moana"
"1749",4501520,4502805,"how this would work.","Moana"
"1750",4502880,4505326,"And usingthe heart of Te Fiti as a light source.","Moana"
"1751",4506760,4509286,"And trying to really choreograph thiswith the fire balls.","Moana"
"1752",4509399,4510890,"You know, when they happen,","Moana"
"1753",4510960,4512927,"and to get a sense of scaleout on the open sea.","Moana"
"1754",4513000,4516287,"We really did, I think, get an epic scale","Moana"
"1755",4516359,4520206,"thanks to our great layout people,and board artists.","Moana"
"1756",4520279,4522122,"And the animators, effects animators,","Moana"
"1757",4522199,4526046,"got a wonderful sense of scaleto these fire balls,","Moana"
"1758",4526119,4528440,"- and the ocean surface.- CLEMENTS: Fun hair stuff, too.","Moana"
"1759",4528520,4530488,"MUSKER: Yeah, climatic...","Moana"
"1760",4530560,4533131,"CLEMENTS:See the speed with the hair.","Moana"
"1761",4533199,4534804,"MUSKER: And justthe emotional climax of this.","Moana"
"1762",4534880,4536927,"We struggled over that shot because,","Moana"
"1763",4537000,4538809,"for a long time,you couldn't see the hook there.","Moana"
"1764",4538880,4541689,"We were trying to make it lookvery elemental, very iconic.","Moana"
"1765",4542159,4544400,"In a general way,we just wanted a strong silhouette.","Moana"
"1766",4544640,4546289,"But it happened so fast,you didn't get it.","Moana"
"1767",4546359,4548043,"So, we had to go backand add more frames,","Moana"
"1768",4548119,4549564,"of the hook coming into position,","Moana"
"1769",4549640,4551164,"'cause you just couldn't read itwell enough.","Moana"
"1770",4551239,4555211,"We got it finallyto where it should be, I think.","Moana"
"1771",4555319,4557800,"And Chris Williamswas big on pushing for that.","Moana"
"1772",4560560,4565087,"CLEMENTS: Once again, I feel likethis is some really great acting.","Moana"
"1773",4565159,4566604,"MUSKER: It's sort ofa companion scene to the other.","Moana"
"1774",4566680,4569206,"That was tricky, 'cause you havetwo acting scenes close together.","Moana"
"1775",4569279,4571009,"But we had that big set piecebetween them","Moana"
"1776",4571079,4572569,"and then the comic beat.","Moana"
"1777",4572640,4575246,"So, it felt like these were bridgeda little bit by those things.","Moana"
"1778",4575319,4577686,"But very controlled acting throughout,","Moana"
"1779",4577800,4581930,"on both Moana, and on Maui.","Moana"
"1780",4582000,4584240,"Just with little looks, you know,back and forth.","Moana"
"1781",4584319,4585810,"Little edgy things.","Moana"
"1782",4585880,4587802,"And they designed this hook,this was another","Moana"
"1783",4587880,4589927,"slightly crazy nightmare,'cause we had earlier versions","Moana"
"1784",4590000,4591286,"where the hookdidn't look damaged enough,","Moana"
"1785",4591359,4593646,"I think we had to go backand kind of correct that.","Moana"
"1786",4593720,4597690,"So, it was clear thatit really wasn't totally broken yet,","Moana"
"1787",4597760,4599444,"but it looked like another good shot","Moana"
"1788",4599520,4601010,"and the hook would be gone forever.","Moana"
"1789",4601079,4603650,"It was really a story pointas much as anything.","Moana"
"1790",4603720,4605529,"We still have to restore the heart.","Moana"
"1791",4605680,4607091,"My hook is cracked.","Moana"
"1792",4607239,4608729,"One more hit, and it's over.","Moana"
"1793",4608800,4611962,"MUSKER: All those little scrimshaw,those little insignias on there,","Moana"
"1794",4612039,4614280,"Manuel Arenas,one of the visual development artists,","Moana"
"1795",4614359,4617170,"came up with those, actually,for another part of the underworld.","Moana"
"1796",4617239,4620608,"And I think it was Ian Gooding's ideato use a lot of those on the hook itself.","Moana"
"1797",4620720,4622131,"Which gives it just a feelingof a history,","Moana"
"1798",4622199,4624247,"that you're not aware of, like,""How did it get there?""","Moana"
"1799",4624319,4628927,"But it feels more ancientand more like it's a mythic object.","Moana"
"1800",4629000,4631479,"CLEMENTS: There is somegreat dialogue acting here","Moana"
"1801",4631560,4634039,"from both Dwayne and Auli'i.","Moana"

"1803",4637640,4639483,"MUSKER: Yeah, Val Amadoranimated these shots...","Moana"
"1804",4639560,4641608,"And then Chad Sellers, who only dida few scenes in the movie,","Moana"
"1805",4641680,4643966,"did these shots,where she does the argument.","Moana"
"1806",4644039,4648728,"And he did a wonderful job of reallygetting into her head","Moana"

"1819",4678600,4680170,"And now it comes down quietly.","Moana"
"1820",4680239,4681604,"In the storyboards, they had this idea","Moana"
"1821",4681680,4682841,"that the water just comes up offstage.","Moana"
"1822",4682920,4685320,"I questioned it, I was like,""Will people be thrown by it?""","Moana"
"1823",4685399,4687766,"They said, ""No, we'll just havea little play of light on her face.""","Moana"

"1827",4694560,4696050,"But it did work well.","Moana"

"1830",4702560,4705722,"It's a scene between her and water,and yet it's emotional.","Moana"
"1831",4705800,4710362,"I think that's a testamentto the animators and everybody.","Moana"

"1419",6069225,6071751,"Every person who comesto the ranch is in need...","Patch Adams"

"1421",6074631,6076565,"They're patients.","Patch Adams"
"1422",6076634,6082003,"But also every person who comes to the ranchis in charge of taking care of someone else-","Patch Adams"
"1423",6082072,6084039,"whether it's cooking for them,cleaning them...","Patch Adams"
"1424",6084108,6087009,"or even as simple a taskas listening.","Patch Adams"
"1425",6087077,6089011,"That makes them doctors.","Patch Adams"
"1426",6089078,6094381,"I use that term broadly, but is not adoctor someone who helps someone else?","Patch Adams"
"1427",6094451,6097480,"When did the term ""doctor"" gettreated with such reverence, as,","Patch Adams"
"1428",6097481,6098954,"""Right this way, Doctor Smith""...","Patch Adams"
"1429",6098956,6101591,"or, ""Excuse me, Dr. Scholl,what wonderful footpads""...","Patch Adams"
"1430",6101658,6105355,"or, ""Pardon me, Dr. Patterson,but your flatulence has no odor""?","Patch Adams"
"1431",6108097,6111658,"At what point in historydid a doctor become more...","Patch Adams"
"1432",6111734,6115966,"than a trusted and learned friendwho visited and treated the ill?","Patch Adams"
"1433",6116039,6119203,"Now, you ask me ifI've been practicing medicine.","Patch Adams"
"1434",6119275,6122369,"Well, if this means openingyour door to those in need-","Patch Adams"
"1435",6122445,6124811,"those in pain-","Patch Adams"
"1436",6124881,6130286,"caring for them, listening to them, applyinga cold cloth until a fever breaks-","Patch Adams"
"1437",6130354,6132652,"if this is practicing medicine,if this is treating a patient...","Patch Adams"
"1438",6132722,6135283,"then I am guiltyas charged, sir.","Patch Adams"
"1439",6135359,6138953,"Did you consider the ramificationsof your actions?","Patch Adams"
"1440",6139029,6141327,"What if one of your patientshad died?","Patch Adams"
"1441",6141398,6143729,"What's wrongwith death, sir?","Patch Adams"
"1442",6143801,6146269,"What are we so mortally afraid of?","Patch Adams"
"1443",6146337,6148502,"Why can't we treat deathwith a certain amount...","Patch Adams"
"1444",6148502,6152301,"of humanity and dignity and decency...and, God forbid, maybe even humor?","Patch Adams"
"1445",6152376,6154310,"Death is not the enemy,gentlemen.","Patch Adams"
"1446",6154377,6158313,"If we're gonna fight a disease, let's fightone of the most terrible diseases of all-","Patch Adams"
"1447",6158381,6159515,"indifference.","Patch Adams"
"1448",6159783,6163444,"Now, I've sat in your schools and heardpeople lecture on transference...","Patch Adams"

"1453",6174230,6178634,"That's why I've listened to yourteachings, and I believe they're wrong.","Patch Adams"
"1454",6178702,6182604,"A doctor's mission should benot just to prevent death...","Patch Adams"
"1455",6182672,6184800,"but also to improvethe quality of life.","Patch Adams"
"1456",6184875,6188037,"That's why you treat a disease,you win, you lose.","Patch Adams"

"757",4627061,4630016,"which always seem to accompany such an event,","Footloose"
"758",4630231,4633648,"the thing that distresses me even more, Ren,","Footloose"
"759",4634820,4639446,"is the spiritual corruptionthat can be involved.","Footloose"
"760",4639658,4643442,"These dances and this kindof music can be destructive.","Footloose"

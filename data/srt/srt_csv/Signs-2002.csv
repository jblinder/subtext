"532",2719980,2724076,"Then her eyes glazed a bit.","Signs"
"533",2724150,2727518,"And then she said,""Swing away.""","Signs"
"534",2729255,2731416,"You know why she said that?","Signs"
"535",2733860,2737422,"Because the nerveendings in her brain
were firing as she died,","Signs"
"536",2737498,2742628,"and some random memory of usat one of your baseball games
just popped into her head.","Signs"

hand-to-hand combat.","Signs"
"696",3766777,3769905,"They wouldn't use ourtechnology or fight
an airborne battle","Signs"

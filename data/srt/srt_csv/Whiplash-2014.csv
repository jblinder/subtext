"543",2911606,2912956,"And I thought about it a lot.","Whiplash"
"544",2913088,2915041,"And this is what's gonna happen, OK?","Whiplash"
"545",2915114,2916661,"I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing.","Whiplash"
"546",2916771,2920224,"And because I'm doing that, it'sgonna take more and more of my time","Whiplash"
"547",2920304,2922150,"and I'm not gonna be able tospend so much time with you.","Whiplash"
"548",2922222,2924523,"And when I do spend time with you,I'll be thinking about drumming.","Whiplash"
"549",2924621,2927007,"I'll be thinking about jazzand my charts and all that.","Whiplash"
"550",2927081,2929068,"And because of that you're gonna start to resent me.","Whiplash"
"551",2929385,2931762,"And you're gonna tell me to ease updrumming, spend more time with you","Whiplash"
"552",2931862,2933081,"because you're not feeling importrant.","Whiplash"
"553",2933184,2935019,"And I'm not gonna be able to do that.","Whiplash"
"554",2935117,2937574,"And I'll just start to resent youfor even asking me to stop drumming.","Whiplash"
"555",2937661,2939436,"And we'll just start to hate each other.","Whiplash"
"556",2939594,2941297,"And it's gonna get very... it's gonna be ugly.","Whiplash"
"557",2941552,2945166,"And so... for those reasons, I'd rather just break it off clean.","Whiplash"
"558",2953550,2955297,"Cuz I wanna be great.","Whiplash"
"559",2957137,2959050,"And you're not?","Whiplash"
"560",2961210,2963501,"I wanna be one of the greats.","Whiplash"
"561",2964963,2966585,"And I'll stop you from doing that?","Whiplash"
"562",2968603,2969195,"Yeah.","Whiplash"

"565",2980844,2983000,"And I barely see you anyway.","Whiplash"
"566",2985083,2987713,"Yeah -And when I did see youyou treated me like shit","Whiplash"
"567",2987804,2989980,"because I'm just some girlwho doesn't know what she wants.","Whiplash"
"568",2990096,2994000,"And you have a path, and you're goingto be great, and I'm gonna be forgotten.","Whiplash"
"569",2994050,2996762,"And therefore, you won'tbe able to give me the time and day","Whiplash"
"570",2996849,2999199,"because you have bigger things to pursue?","Whiplash"
"571",3001157,3002934,"That's exactly my point.","Whiplash"
"572",3003242,3004842,"What the fuck is wrong with you?","Whiplash"

"801",4551228,4554994,"I was there to push peoplebeyond what's expected of them.","Whiplash"
"802",4557556,4559711,"I believe that is...","Whiplash"
"803",4560837,4563139,"an absolute necessity.","Whiplash"
"804",4565014,4568000,"Otherwise we're depriving the worldof the next Louie Armstrong,","Whiplash"
"805",4568000,4569502,"the next Charlie Parker.","Whiplash"
"806",4571552,4575060,"I told that story about how CharlieParker became Charlie Parker, right?","Whiplash"
"807",4575319,4577333,"Jo Jones threw a cymbalat his head. -Exactly.","Whiplash"
"808",4578310,4580423,"Parker was a young kid. Pretty good on the sax.","Whiplash"
"809",4580590,4582386,"Gets up to play in the cutting session","Whiplash"
"810",4582639,4584386,"and he fucks it up.","Whiplash"
"811",4585527,4588036,"And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.","Whiplash"
"812",4589063,4590939,"And he's laughed off-stage.","Whiplash"
"813",4591873,4596000,"Cries himself to sleep that night, butthe next moring, what does he do?","Whiplash"
"814",4596000,4597500,"He practices.","Whiplash"
"815",4597814,4601092,"And he practices and he practices,with one goal in mind:","Whiplash"
"816",4601684,4603483,"never to be laughed at again.","Whiplash"
"817",4604427,4607199,"And a year later hegoes back to the Reno.","Whiplash"
"818",4607663,4609300,"And he steps up on that stage","Whiplash"
"819",4609301,4613001,"and he plays the best motherfuckingsolo the world has ever heard.","Whiplash"
"820",4616096,4618344,"So imagine if Jones just said,","Whiplash"
"821",4618716,4620283,"""Well, that's okay Charlie.""","Whiplash"
"822",4620462,4622612,"""That was alright, good job.""","Whiplash"
"823",4624387,4625494,"And Charlie thinks to himself,","Whiplash"
"824",4625592,4627979,"""Well, shit, I did a pretty good job.""","Whiplash"
"825",4629206,4630471,"End of story.","Whiplash"
"826",4630712,4631639,"No bird.","Whiplash"
"827",4634167,4637229,"That to me is an absolute tragedy.","Whiplash"
"828",4638000,4640500,"But that's just what the world wants now.","Whiplash"
"829",4641011,4643176,"People wonder why jazz is dying.","Whiplash"
"830",4648153,4649034,"I tell you man,","Whiplash"
"831",4649146,4653872,"every Starbucks' jazz albumjust proved my point, really.","Whiplash"
"832",4655201,4657841,"There are no two wordsin English language","Whiplash"
"833",4657961,4661853,"more harmful than ""good job"".","Whiplash"

"835",4669073,4671029,"You know maybe... you go to far,","Whiplash"
"836",4671030,4674631,"you discourage next Charlie Parkerfrom ever becoming Charlie Parker?","Whiplash"
"837",4675845,4676932,"No man, no.","Whiplash"
"838",4677082,4680172,"Because the next Charlie Parkerwould never be discouraged.","Whiplash"
"839",4680453,4681389,"Yeah.","Whiplash"
"840",4687277,4688256,"The truth is, Andrew,","Whiplash"
"841",4690822,4693086,"I never really had a Charlie Parker.","Whiplash"
"842",4696537,4697600,"But I tried.","Whiplash"
"843",4699006,4702000,"I actually fucking tried.","Whiplash"

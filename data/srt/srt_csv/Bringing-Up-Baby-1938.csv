"945",3022437,3024163,"""Mr. Bone."" Isn't that amazing?","Bringing Up Baby"
"946",3024163,3027807,"You told me not to tell Aunt Elizabethwhat your real name was.","Bringing Up Baby"
"947",3027807,3031633,"I didn't tell youto think up a name like Bone.","Bringing Up Baby"

"952",3048488,3051972,"- Baby would eat George.- That's what I mean.","Bringing Up Baby"
"953",3051972,3055798,"There it was, straight before me,crouching as tigers do before the kill.","Bringing Up Baby"
"954",3056575,3058110,"But I was ready for him.","Bringing Up Baby"
"955",3058110,3061935,"I drew a bead, leveled awayand caught him right between the eyes.","Bringing Up Baby"
"956",3062329,3065206,"My, it certainly wasa thrilling experience...","Bringing Up Baby"

"965",3091513,3095338,"- Malay Peninsula, perchance?- Excuse me.","Bringing Up Baby"
"966",3097682,3099919,"At least that got a rise out of him.","Bringing Up Baby"
"967",3099919,3102925,"You see, you shouldn't have mentionedthe Malay Peninsula.","Bringing Up Baby"
"968",3102925,3106409,"He was horribly clawed there by a tiger.He doesn't like talking about it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"969",3106409,3109477,"I had a gun bearer oncewho was clawed by a tiger.","Bringing Up Baby"
"970",3109477,3113303,"He... The poor...","Bringing Up Baby"
"971",3114304,3117917,"I was just telling Major Applegatethat you were clawed by a tiger...","Bringing Up Baby"

"975",3127122,3130830,"What type of gun do you usein hunting tigers, Mr. Bone?","Bringing Up Baby"
"976",3130830,3134656,"I personally use a bolt-action Mauserwith a very large bore.","Bringing Up Baby"
"977",3135497,3138311,"Excuse me.","Bringing Up Baby"
"978",3138311,3141826,"Susan, imagine giving a dinner partywith your husband stalking...","Bringing Up Baby"

"981",3152661,3156487,"No, this is too much. I can't stand it.","Bringing Up Baby"

"984",3164872,3168698,"Digging trenches.Blaming it on an innocent dog.","Bringing Up Baby"
"985",3169635,3172065,"Nothing but a heap of nonsense.","Bringing Up Baby"
"986",3172065,3175581,"Enough to drive a man crazy.","Bringing Up Baby"
"987",3175581,3178618,"And then they say,""Keep away from the bottle. Don't drink.""","Bringing Up Baby"
"988",3178618,3182443,"No, not even a wee dropto steady a man's nerves.","Bringing Up Baby"
"989",3183317,3185490,"If one more thing happens, I'll quit.","Bringing Up Baby"
"990",3185490,3189316,"And where Aloysius Gogarty goes,Mrs. Aloysius Gogarty goes, too.","Bringing Up Baby"
"991",3190445,3194271,"A doctor chasing after a dog!","Bringing Up Baby"
"992",3196998,3198532,"Just picture it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"993",3198532,3201313,"A vast, mysterious silencevibrant with life...","Bringing Up Baby"
"994",3201313,3204797,"strange cries in the night.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1003",3231583,3234205,"- Well, what do you say it was?- A leopard.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1004",3234205,3235483,"Don't be ridiculous.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1005",3235483,3238137,"Major Applegate would know a leopard cryif he heard it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1006",3238137,3241173,"Thank you, Elizabeth.I'm an authority on animal cries.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1007",3241173,3243443,"Now, you take the rogue elephant,for instance.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1008",3243443,3246416,"Excuse me, Major. You're right.It is a loon.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1009",3246416,3247918,"Thank you.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1017",3268758,3271348,"Now, let me see.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1018",3271348,3275173,"There we have it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1019",3279690,3282184,"- Pardon me.- It's still a loon.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1022",3286595,3290421,"- Try again.- Yes, I shall.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1023",3297527,3299349,"Now, I didn't do that.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1024",3299349,3301746,"It was probably an echo.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1025",3301746,3304304,"It was a long time coming back, wasn't it?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1026",3304304,3308130,"- Try again.- I shall.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1133",3610974,3613851,"- Yes. Shall we run?- Yes.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1134",3613851,3617677,"I can't understand why a loonwould answer a leopard's cry.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1135",3618519,3620564,"There's something wrong.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1136",3620564,3624145,"- They both sound exactly alike to me.- No, pardon me, Elizabeth.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1137",3624145,3627022,"Please, the leopard's cry isentirely different.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1138",3627022,3630847,"As I explained to you in there,the leopard's cry goes like this.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1139",3635812,3638241,"What a terrible noise.I don't see how you do it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1140",3638241,3640862,"It's done largely with the palate.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1141",3640862,3644698,"The hands play an important partin the resonance and carrying power.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1142",3644698,3648278,"- Why do you put your thumbs together?- You see, the thumbs...","Bringing Up Baby"
"1143",3648278,3652103,"it's very necessary that the baseof the thumbs are close together like that.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1144",3652242,3656078,"That brings out a sort of pear-shaped tone,you see?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1145",3656078,3659904,"Having done this, you take a deep breath,keep the throat well open...","Bringing Up Baby"
"1146",3660393,3664218,"and out comes...","Bringing Up Baby"
"1147",3669790,3672507,"My. That's fine, Elizabeth...","Bringing Up Baby"
"1148",3672507,3674425,"for one who hasn't had any practice.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1149",3674425,3676663,"Really, it is. You've got something there.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1150",3676663,3679252,"- Got what?- The mating cry.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1151",3679252,3682257,"- Now, don't be rude, Horace.- I'm not rude.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1152",3682257,3685006,"I was merely alluding to the screamyou did just now.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1153",3685006,3686987,"- I didn't scream.- You didn't scream?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1154",3686987,3689129,"- I certainly did not.- You didn't scream?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1155",3689129,3691271,"No. I ought to know if I screamed.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1156",3691271,3693508,"Then there must besomething wrong here.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1157",3693508,3696833,"I should say so.I've never known anything like it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1158",3696833,3699998,"Ever since I came into the housethere's been something wrong.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1159",3699998,3701340,"- Elizabeth...- It's been bedlam!","Bringing Up Baby"
"1160",3701340,3704793,"- Don't you think it's time we went inside?- No. We've only just left it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1161",3704793,3707221,"But don't you thinkit's a good idea to go back?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1162",3707221,3709843,"No, I think it's a good ideato continue our walk.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1163",3709843,3713669,"But don't you find it a bit chillywithout a gun?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1164",3721127,3723491,"- Why don't you sing, David?- I can't.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1165",3723491,3726560,"- You can. You have a fine strong voice.- But not for singing.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1166",3726560,3729629,"It's not fair. You're just being stubborn.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1167",3729629,3733241,"- That's a dog.- George.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1168",3733241,3737066,"- What's the matter?- Something moved in that bush.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1169",3737364,3741189,"Let me go first.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1170",3756767,3759453,"Don't you think it would be betterif I went first?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1171",3759453,3762361,"No. You might get hurt.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1172",3762361,3765750,"Thank you, David.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1173",3765750,3768242,"- I can't see a thing.- Neither can I.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1174",3768242,3772068,"Are you sure you saw something movingin here, because I can't...","Bringing Up Baby"
"1175",3772590,3774796,"Susan, where are you?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1176",3774796,3778622,"- Here I am.- This is no time to be playing squat tag.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1178",3783330,3787155,"I'm caught on something.Help me, will you?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1179",3787293,3790266,"- Help me, will you?- No. That's poison ivy.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1180",3790266,3792664,"I bet you wouldn't treat Miss Swallowthis way.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1181",3792664,3795157,"I'll bet she knows poison ivywhen she sees it.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1185",3811459,3814464,"- Don't laugh.- I can't help it.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1186",3814464,3818290,"You look so silly.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1187",3842337,3845022,"Did you hear that? That's Baby.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1188",3845022,3848847,"- It's George, too.- You don't suppose...","Bringing Up Baby"
"1189",3848953,3852779,"Shut up.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1190",3853141,3856966,"Look!","Bringing Up Baby"
"1191",3862347,3864937,"Look, David, they like each other.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1192",3864937,3868762,"But goodness knowshow long that's going to last.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1193",3874207,3878032,"In another minute, my intercostal claviclewill be gone forever.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1194",3882357,3884212,"Here, George. Come here.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1195",3884212,3888037,"No. Susan, be quiet.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1196",3894153,3896070,"Is there any way to cross this stream?","Bringing Up Baby"
"1197",3896070,3899895,"- Surely it's shallow. We can wade across.- Good.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1198",3905244,3909069,"The riverbed's changed.","Bringing Up Baby"

"1203",3924711,3927269,"While I'm wet I'm gonna goto the other side!","Bringing Up Baby"
"1204",3927269,3931094,"Don't leave me!","Bringing Up Baby"
"1205",3935451,3939276,"If we'd had a bathhouse,this wouldn't have been so complicated.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1206",3939735,3941365,"Next time I'll try and arrange one.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1207",3941365,3945190,"Or perhaps there are portable bathhousesfor people like you. There must be.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1208",3946511,3948557,"Don't be so grouchy.","Bringing Up Baby"
"1209",3948557,3952105,"We could have such fun. There's moonlightand everything is so lovely.","Bringing Up Baby"

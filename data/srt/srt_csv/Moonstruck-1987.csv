"909",4924833,4927267,"She was as white as snow.","Moonstruck"
"910",4927336,4931796,"Then she completelypulled back from death...","Moonstruck"
"911",4931873,4933841,"and stood up...","Moonstruck"
"912",4933909,4936207,"and put on her clothes...","Moonstruck"
"913",4936278,4939338,"and began to cookfor everyone in the house:","Moonstruck"

"920",4963905,4966373,"My father-in-lawhas this wrong idea...","Moonstruck"

"924",4974283,4977275,"I want you to tell me the truth,if you can.","Moonstruck"
"925",4980088,4981646,"Why do men chase women?","Moonstruck"
"926",4987696,4989630,"There's the Bible story.","Moonstruck"
"927",4990732,4996466,"God took a rib from Adamand made Eve.","Moonstruck"
"928",4998006,5000736,"Now maybe men chase womento get the rib back.","Moonstruck"
"929",5000809,5003869,"When God took the rib...","Moonstruck"
"930",5003945,5006675,"He left a big hole there...","Moonstruck"
"931",5006748,5008909,"a place where there usedto be something.","Moonstruck"
"932",5008984,5011646,"And the women have that.","Moonstruck"
"933",5011720,5013153,"Now maybe...","Moonstruck"
"934",5013221,5014882,"just maybe...","Moonstruck"
"935",5014956,5019052,"a man isn't completeas a man...","Moonstruck"
"936",5019127,5020651,"without a woman.","Moonstruck"
"937",5022197,5024131,"Why would a man need...","Moonstruck"
"938",5024199,5026133,"more than one woman?","Moonstruck"
"939",5027536,5029094,"I don't know.","Moonstruck"
"940",5030672,5032333,"Maybe because he fears death.","Moonstruck"
"941",5034009,5036500,"That's it.That's the reason.","Moonstruck"
"942",5036578,5038478,"I don't know!","Moonstruck"

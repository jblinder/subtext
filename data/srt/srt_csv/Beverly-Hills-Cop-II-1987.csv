"1124",5094381,5097176,"- If Cain's the man, where's the money?- Where's Dent?","Beverly Hills Cop II"
"1125",5097176,5099427,"You said he was shipping oil equipmentto Central America.","Beverly Hills Cop II"
"1126",5099429,5101639,"Yeah, but how? Where?","Beverly Hills Cop II"

"1144",5174837,5179007,"Dent could buy guns here for a millionand sells them there for 10 million.","Beverly Hills Cop II"
"1145",5179967,5184304,"- Look at all that oil.- I don't see oil.","Beverly Hills Cop II"

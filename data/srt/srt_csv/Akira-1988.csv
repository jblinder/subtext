"176",1248159,1251094,"I can't believe that there's amole on the executive council.","Akira"
"177",1251963,1253453,"Even if that's true...","Akira"
"178",1253731,1255562,"That isn't important.","Akira"
"179",1255767,1259932,"What's important is diplomacy and politicalmaneuvering, which you seem to despise.","Akira"
"180",1260239,1262469,"I never studied them in school, you see.","Akira"

"187",1310292,1312260,"I'm terribly sorry to call you here,","Akira"
"188",1312561,1315223,"but there's somethingyou really must see.","Akira"
"189",1319901,1321266,"Please observe.","Akira"
"190",1321403,1324497,"It's the special patternfrom that young boy.","Akira"
"191",1324639,1326608,"It doesn't resembleany I've seen so far,","Akira"
"192",1326876,1329640,"and I've never seen a developmentalspeed or configuration like this.","Akira"
"193",1329979,1334109,"It may have begun with the shock ofcontact with Number 26, or possibly...","Akira"
"194",1334650,1337141,"Have you finished running acomparison with Akira's pattern?","Akira"
"195",1337320,1339185,"I'll superimpose it over this one.","Akira"
"196",1343961,1348955,"This projection was constructed usingmixed data, so a comparison is difficult,","Akira"
"197",1349533,1353663,"but I believe this boy'spattern is the key to solving...","Akira"
"198",1353704,1355865,"...the riddle of Akira'spattern growth process.","Akira"
"199",1356640,1358108,"All right. Continue.","Akira"
"200",1358443,1360104,"Very well, sir. Thank you.","Akira"

"202",1365250,1367150,"It may be rough on him,","Akira"
"203",1367185,1370416,"but I thought we might try startinghim off with level 7 capsules.","Akira"
"204",1370722,1371814,"Is it safe?","Akira"
"205",1371990,1373219,"Leave everything to me.","Akira"
"206",1373259,1374419,"That's not what I meant!","Akira"
"207",1375461,1380398,"I'm asking that if he turns out tohave power like Akira's like you said,","Akira"
"208",1380499,1383696,"will we be able to control it?","Akira"
"209",1384003,1385698,"Well, that's...","Akira"
"210",1386338,1387828,"Can I leave this to you?","Akira"
"211",1388140,1393636,"Well, if we use the latest examinationequipment to collect even more data...","Akira"
"212",1393680,1397013,"...and do a multifacetedanalysis, then surely...","Akira"
"213",1399820,1403085,"Maybe we shouldn'ttouch that power.","Akira"
"214",1404124,1406218,"The power of God?","Akira"
"215",1409397,1412127,"A... ki... ra...","Akira"
"216",1412333,1417828,"But we have to.We have to touch it and control it.","Akira"
"217",1418406,1422207,"If it looks like it's too much for usto handle, terminate him at once!","Akira"
"218",1422344,1423641,"There can be no hesitation!","Akira"
"219",1424179,1425703,"Very well, Colonel.","Akira"

"795",4233345,4235973,"He's probably dead by now...","Akira"
"796",4239052,4242579,"You did this, Tetsuo?","Akira"
"797",4242622,4246991,"So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?","Akira"
"798",4247194,4248092,"Tetsuo!","Akira"

"802",4266814,4268645,"Shit...","Akira"
"803",4275657,4277215,"He went to where Akira is?","Akira"
"804",4277559,4279026,"That's what that girl said.","Akira"
"805",4279761,4283891,"The army, you, and Ryu are alllooking for this ""Akira"" guy,","Akira"
"806",4284199,4286100,"so that's why you'rechasing after Tetsuo.","Akira"
"807",4286502,4288766,"It has something to do withthat power of Tetsuo's, right?","Akira"
"808",4290773,4292764,"What the hell is this ""Akira""thing you keep talking about?","Akira"
"809",4296012,4300244,"Ryu told me about it once.He said that Akira is absolute energy.","Akira"
"810",4301017,4302383,"Absolute energy?","Akira"
"811",4303053,4306716,"Humans do all kinds of thingsduring their lifetime, right?","Akira"
"812",4307091,4310993,"Discovering things, building things...","Akira"
"813",4311996,4318368,"Things like houses, motorcycles,bridges, cities, and rockets...","Akira"
"814",4319604,4322505,"All that knowledge and energy...Where do you suppose it comes from?","Akira"
"815",4324776,4327870,"Humans were like monkeys once, right?","Akira"
"816",4328413,4331143,"And before that, like reptiles and fish.","Akira"
"817",4332117,4336020,"And before that, plankton and amoebas.","Akira"
"818",4336255,4340191,"Even creatures like those haveincredible energy inside them.","Akira"
"819",4340660,4343823,"Because of genes, I guess.","Akira"
"820",4344096,4348362,"And even before that, maybe therewere genes in the water and air.","Akira"
"821",4349268,4351203,"Even in space dust, too, I bet.","Akira"
"822",4351872,4355569,"If that's true, whatmemories are hidden in it?","Akira"
"823",4356343,4360040,"The beginning of the universe, maybe.Or maybe even before that.","Akira"
"824",4360180,4363980,"Hey, what's the matter?Are you okay?","Akira"
"825",4364184,4366584,"Did you get hit onthe head back there?","Akira"
"826",4366720,4369884,"Maybe everyone has those memories.","Akira"
"827",4370525,4373153,"What if there were some mistakeand the progression went wrong,","Akira"
"828",4373461,4377795,"and something like an amoebawere given power like a human's?","Akira"
"829",4379701,4381532,"That's what Akira is?","Akira"
"830",4382370,4384999,"Amoebas don't buildhouses and bridges.","Akira"
"831",4385674,4388302,"They just devour allthe food around them.","Akira"
"832",4388510,4392640,"That's what Tetsuo's doing?You're saying he has that kind of energy?!","Akira"
"833",4393248,4397742,"A long time ago, there were peoplewho tried to control that power.","Akira"
"834",4397920,4400287,"At the government's request, you see.","Akira"
"835",4400323,4404760,"They failed, and ittriggered the Fall of Tokyo.","Akira"
"836",4405829,4409492,"That power is still too much for...","Akira"
"837",4412068,4413057,"What?!","Akira"
"838",4413837,4415202,"The door's unlocked.","Akira"
"839",4418943,4419932,"Huh?","Akira"
"840",4425149,4427674,"This has got to be a trap.","Akira"
"841",4428252,4429344,"Go back, then.","Akira"
"842",4429387,4432755,"No, we ought to find outhow much of it is a trap...","Akira"
"843",4435394,4439524,"By the way, what's withyou and that Ryu guy?","Akira"
"844",4440565,4442590,"- What do you mean?- You're always together.","Akira"
"845",4442634,4444465,"That's none of your business!","Akira"
"846",4445470,4449168,"What I'm saying is, he doesn'tknow about us, does he?","Akira"
"847",4450410,4451308,"""Us""?","Akira"
"848",4451344,4453744,"Hey, wait a minute!What's that supposed to mean?","Akira"
"849",4454781,4456180,"Do you think this will work?","Akira"
"850",4456249,4462313,"It can't be helped. At this point,our only option is to use her.","Akira"
"851",4462789,4469389,"The fact that she turned up right underour noses says as much, I think.","Akira"
"852",4469730,4470754,"I guess...","Akira"
"853",4484779,4488237,"Have arrived at Ward 13,East Ginza intersection. Over.","Akira"
"854",4489150,4491710,"Northern District battalion has notresponded to mobilization request.","Akira"

"857",4499562,4504795,"It doesn't look like a bomb explosion,so we think it was him.","Akira"
"858",4505601,4508900,"It was almost certainly the work of thesubject that escaped from the lab.","Akira"
"859",4509438,4511736,"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!Understood!","Akira"
"860",4518982,4519971,"Kaneda!","Akira"

"862",4523720,4526484,"Something seemed strange abouthim from the second I saw him.","Akira"
"863",4526623,4529058,"He was wearing what lookedlike a white hospital gown.","Akira"
"864",4529560,4531721,"It was like he wasa different person.","Akira"
"865",4532563,4536932,"Yamagata asked him ifhe was really Tetsuo.","Akira"
"866",4537635,4541571,"And then... Yamagata, he...","Akira"
"867",4544977,4546968,"We've always been together.","Akira"
"868",4547579,4553279,"I've known everything about himsince we were in the children's home.","Akira"
"869",4554052,4557385,"He was a klutz, andeverybody made him cry.","Akira"
"870",4558991,4562587,"Oh, right... He wanted toknow where your bike was.","Akira"
"871",4563496,4565054,"My bike?","Akira"
"872",4573606,4574903,"What're you gonna do?","Akira"
"873",4576276,4578643,"I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.","Akira"

"883",4639042,4643104,"Akira's power exists within everyone.","Akira"
"884",4644082,4645140,"Who's there?!","Akira"
"885",4646317,4652415,"But when that power is awakened,you must choose how to use it,","Akira"
"886",4652890,4656758,"even if you weren't prepared for it.","Akira"
"887",4658797,4661891,"And he has made his choice.","Akira"
"888",4663168,4666968,"Tetsuo is our newest companion.","Akira"
"889",4668574,4672567,"We're partly to blame for his actions.","Akira"
"890",4672778,4675475,"Why did you take Kei, then?!","Akira"
"891",4676016,4678644,"We want her to help us.","Akira"

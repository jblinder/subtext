"112",553160,555310,"Go on, Mummy.It was springtime in Germany...","Blonde Venus"
"113",555400,557311,"It was springtime in Germany,and it was warm.","Blonde Venus"
"114",557400,560915,"I had spring feverand the air was full of blossoms.","Blonde Venus"
"115",561360,562918,"Now it's your turn.","Blonde Venus"
"116",563000,565878,"Let's see. I was out withsome other students on a walking trip...","Blonde Venus"
"117",565960,568758,"and pretty soon we came to a dragonsitting in an automobile...","Blonde Venus"
"118",568840,571070,"who told us there was a magic poolin the forest.","Blonde Venus"
"119",571280,573874,"- And what did you do?- We went to the pool, of course.","Blonde Venus"
"120",573960,576076,"- And what do you suppose we saw?- What?","Blonde Venus"
"121",576160,579675,"Imagine! Half a dozen princessestaking a bath.","Blonde Venus"
"122",580560,584314,"- And what did you do when you saw him?- I told him to go away.","Blonde Venus"
"123",584520,586511,"- And did he?- He did not.","Blonde Venus"
"124",587800,589233,"And what happened then?","Blonde Venus"
"125",589320,591515,"The most beautiful princess of all...","Blonde Venus"
"126",591600,594273,"said that if I'd go away,she'd grant me my wish.","Blonde Venus"
"127",594440,597512,"- And what did you wish?- I wished to see her again.","Blonde Venus"
"128",597600,599352,"I couldn't think of anything better to wish.","Blonde Venus"
"129",599440,603433,"So that night I went to a theatre,and music began to play.","Blonde Venus"
"130",604280,607636,"And out upon the stagestepped this princess...","Blonde Venus"
"131",607720,611599,"and she looked more beautiful than ever.She was beautiful!","Blonde Venus"
"132",613240,615708,"And then your heart began to go like this?","Blonde Venus"
"133",618840,620512,"And Mummy began to sing?","Blonde Venus"
"134",620600,623239,"And my heart stopped beating entirely.","Blonde Venus"
"135",624080,625798,"What happened to you when you saw him?","Blonde Venus"
"136",625880,629350,"I could hardly sing, and I could barely waituntil I saw him again.","Blonde Venus"
"137",629440,632034,"But you did see him again, didn't you?","Blonde Venus"
"138",632120,634190,"I met him later that night.","Blonde Venus"
"139",634880,637678,"- What happened then?- You can never guess.","Blonde Venus"
"140",638000,640468,"- We went walking.- Go on, walk.","Blonde Venus"
"141",641240,642753,"Okay, skipper.","Blonde Venus"
"142",649560,651198,"And then we came to a park.","Blonde Venus"
"143",651280,653919,"Only there was a tremendously largeyellow moon up in the sky.","Blonde Venus"
"144",654000,656275,"It was altogether too big and too bright.","Blonde Venus"
"145",656360,658954,"But it was dark under the trees, very dark.","Blonde Venus"
"146",659040,660678,"This is a tree, Johnny.","Blonde Venus"
"147",660760,664116,"- And what happened under the tree?- Then he kissed me.","Blonde Venus"
"148",665080,667958,"- And what happened after that?- He kissed me again.","Blonde Venus"
"149",670080,671991,"And what happened then?","Blonde Venus"
"150",673880,675677,"Then we were married.","Blonde Venus"
"151",678440,679953,"And then?","Blonde Venus"
"152",682000,684639,"And then we started to think about you...","Blonde Venus"
"153",685360,686839,"Get out of here.","Blonde Venus"
"154",737880,740599,"Would you need that $1,500 all at once?","Blonde Venus"
"155",741200,744078,"No, but if I had $300,I could at least get to Germany.","Blonde Venus"
"156",744160,746355,"I haven't yet figured outa way of paying the rent...","Blonde Venus"
"157",746440,748635,"unless I part with the microscope.","Blonde Venus"
"158",748720,751280,"So I'm afraid we'll have to postponeour trip abroad this year.","Blonde Venus"
"159",751360,754079,"I could earn that moneyby going back to the stage.","Blonde Venus"
"160",754160,756151,"I won't have you do that.","Blonde Venus"
"161",757160,759276,"But the doctor says you must go away.","Blonde Venus"
"162",759360,763239,"If I worked a few weeks,I might make enough for your passage.","Blonde Venus"
"163",763600,765875,"And then we'll find a wayto keep you over there...","Blonde Venus"
"164",765960,767188,"until you get well.","Blonde Venus"
"165",767280,770716,"It's out of the question.I won't have you go back to the stage.","Blonde Venus"
"166",778560,780198,"- Ned?- What is it?","Blonde Venus"
"167",780320,782993,"I was going back to my old work anyway.","Blonde Venus"
"168",783080,785548,"- Will it make you happy?- It isn't that. We need money.","Blonde Venus"
"169",785640,788200,"It's only a question of weeks.My formula is almost completed...","Blonde Venus"
"170",788280,790669,"- and then we'll have all the money we need.- I know, dear.","Blonde Venus"
"171",790760,795595,"But in the meantime, I'm going to dosomething to give you a chance to get well.","Blonde Venus"
"172",803840,805956,"Have you come to be placed?Yes.","Blonde Venus"
"173",806040,807917,"- What's your name?- Faraday.","Blonde Venus"

"876",4370560,4372915,"It represents my life work.","Blonde Venus"
"877",4373040,4377318,"Had I had time to exploit it properly,I could have made a fortune!","Blonde Venus"
"878",4388880,4391030,"Queen of Hearts, that's me.","Blonde Venus"

"890",4475240,4477276,"I, for one, don't think I'll sit through it.","Blonde Venus"
"891",4477360,4479590,"Say, what do you happen to knowabout this Helen Jones?","Blonde Venus"

"893",4481880,4483552,"I didn't say I was, did I?","Blonde Venus"
"894",4483680,4486717,"They say she came over from South Americaabout five months ago.","Blonde Venus"
"895",4486800,4489917,"When she got here, she used man after manas a stepping stone.","Blonde Venus"
"896",4490000,4492309,"Then all of a sudden,Paris went wild over her.","Blonde Venus"
"897",4492400,4495995,"That's all I know, except they sayshe's as cold as the proverbial icicle.","Blonde Venus"
"898",4496120,4498680,"- That's pretty cold, isn't it?- It's cold enough for me.","Blonde Venus"

"903",4603240,4605356,"Let me come backstage, will you?","Blonde Venus"
"904",4606440,4609876,"I seem to rememberyou came backstage once before.","Blonde Venus"
"905",4619800,4622109,"If the moon began to waltz","Blonde Venus"
"906",4622200,4624589,"Or the sun did somersaults","Blonde Venus"
"907",4624680,4627558,"Do you think I'd care or stop and stare?","Blonde Venus"
"908",4627640,4629392,"I couldn't be annoyed","Blonde Venus"
"909",4629480,4631516,"If the hens refused to lay","Blonde Venus"
"910",4631600,4633875,"Or if bulls gave milk some way","Blonde Venus"
"911",4633960,4635359,"Do you think I'd care?","Blonde Venus"
"912",4635440,4636919,"That's their affair","Blonde Venus"
"913",4637000,4638831,"I couldn't be annoyed","Blonde Venus"
"914",4638920,4641309,"If everyone stood on his head","Blonde Venus"
"915",4641400,4643516,"And on his hands he wore shoes","Blonde Venus"
"916",4643600,4646319,"I'd still eat crackers in my bed","Blonde Venus"
"917",4646400,4648470,"What have I got to lose?","Blonde Venus"
"918",4648560,4650630,"If you ate soup with a fork","Blonde Venus"
"919",4650720,4652995,"Or if babies brought the stork","Blonde Venus"
"920",4653080,4654513,"Do you think I'd care?","Blonde Venus"
"921",4654600,4655794,"I'd still declare","Blonde Venus"
"922",4655880,4658235,"I couldn't be annoyed","Blonde Venus"
"923",4658520,4660556,"Bravo!","Blonde Venus"
"924",4684960,4687394,"Well, Nick,did you succeed in forgetting me?","Blonde Venus"
"925",4687480,4689277,"Forget you? I should say not.","Blonde Venus"
"926",4689360,4692352,"I haven't stopped thinking about youa single day since I last saw you.","Blonde Venus"
"927",4692440,4694670,"How long has that been?Must be more than a year now.","Blonde Venus"

"929",4700760,4703354,"How did you happen to come to Paris?How long have you been here?","Blonde Venus"
"930",4703440,4705351,"Thank you.I've got a million questions to ask you.","Blonde Venus"
"931",4705440,4708955,"Better not ask them, Nick.I'd rather not talk about the past.","Blonde Venus"
"932",4709040,4710792,"Well, let's talk about the present.","Blonde Venus"
"933",4710880,4712950,"Are you happy?Are you in love with anybody?","Blonde Venus"
"934",4713040,4715873,"I'm not in love with anybody,and I'm completely happy.","Blonde Venus"
"935",4716680,4717999,"Funny, isn't it?","Blonde Venus"
"936",4718560,4720516,"No, it's tragic to me.","Blonde Venus"
"937",4720600,4724479,"Wish I were necessary to your happiness.But I guess I never did mean much to you.","Blonde Venus"
"938",4724840,4727991,"Maybe you did.Anyway, nothing means much to me now.","Blonde Venus"
"939",4728080,4731117,"It's better this way, no chains at all.I haven't a care in the world.","Blonde Venus"
"940",4731200,4732997,"You're lying. Where's Johnny?","Blonde Venus"
"941",4734200,4736839,"Home, I suppose, with his father.","Blonde Venus"
"942",4736920,4739309,"Say, I know you better than that.All this is fake.","Blonde Venus"
"943",4739400,4741755,"You care more about Johnnythan anything else on Earth.","Blonde Venus"
"944",4741840,4743239,"What if I did?","Blonde Venus"
"945",4743680,4746194,"I'm going back to the Statesday after tomorrow.","Blonde Venus"
"946",4746480,4749756,"Come with me and look up Johnny andbreak that crust of ice around your heart.","Blonde Venus"
"947",4749840,4751990,"What's the use of talkingabout the impossible?","Blonde Venus"
"948",4752080,4753718,"I'm not allowed to go near him.","Blonde Venus"
"949",4753920,4755672,"Are you divorced?","Blonde Venus"

"956",4768880,4770950,"What for? I'd go to pieces.","Blonde Venus"
"957",4777320,4779914,"Excuse me, please,but they are calling for Madame.","Blonde Venus"
"958",4780000,4783515,"It is marvellous. The house is sold outfor two months in advance.","Blonde Venus"
"959",4788720,4792030,"You see, Nick?I couldn't leave even if I wanted to.","Blonde Venus"
"960",4792520,4794317,"Drop in again before you go.","Blonde Venus"
"961",4794400,4796516,"I don't think I will. Goodbye, Helen.","Blonde Venus"

"966",4831600,4834319,"Sorry about the pudding.You see, I never tried making one before.","Blonde Venus"
"967",4834400,4836994,"It's pretty good, Daddy,if you only eat the middle.","Blonde Venus"
"968",4837120,4840237,"Johnny, do you know who that is?","Blonde Venus"
"969",4843760,4845876,"No, who is it?","Blonde Venus"
"970",4847480,4849038,"Do you remember Mother, Johnny?","Blonde Venus"
"971",4849120,4852112,"Sure, I do. Is that her picture?","Blonde Venus"
"972",4885760,4889673,"- I don't think I can do it, Nick.- Nonsense, you've got to see him.","Blonde Venus"
"973",4891840,4893193,"Come in.","Blonde Venus"

"976",4917480,4920358,"I suppose you havea very good reason for coming here?","Blonde Venus"
"977",4921400,4923550,"As a matter of fact, I have, Mr. Faraday.","Blonde Venus"
"978",4923640,4925756,"Your wife wants to see Johnny.","Blonde Venus"
"979",4925840,4928354,"- Where is she?- Right outside the door.","Blonde Venus"
"980",4928760,4930079,"Who's that, Daddy?","Blonde Venus"
"981",4938560,4940755,"It's bedtime.Start undressing, will you, Johnny?","Blonde Venus"
"982",4940840,4942876,"I'll be with you in a few minutes.","Blonde Venus"
"983",4949960,4952349,"Do you mind going now, Mr. Townsend?I'm very tired.","Blonde Venus"
"984",4952440,4954670,"So you have no intentionof allowing Helen to see the boy.","Blonde Venus"
"985",4954760,4955795,"No.","Blonde Venus"
"986",4955880,4958030,"Look here, Faraday.I'm going to marry Helen.","Blonde Venus"
"987",4958120,4959758,"I've just read the papers. Congratulations.","Blonde Venus"

"990",4963320,4965595,"I've been teaching Johnnyto forget his mother.","Blonde Venus"
"991",4965680,4969070,"It's been a pretty tough joband I don't intend to have my work spoiled.","Blonde Venus"
"992",4969160,4970354,"I see.","Blonde Venus"
"993",4974840,4977035,"You're not so very well off financially,are you?","Blonde Venus"
"994",4977120,4978917,"That's nobody's business but my own.","Blonde Venus"
"995",4979000,4981150,"Would it be worth, let us say...","Blonde Venus"
"996",4982040,4984759,"$1,000 to let her see him for 10 minutes?","Blonde Venus"
"997",4984840,4986068,"$100 a minute?","Blonde Venus"
"998",4986160,4989232,"Surely, Mr. Townsend,you can afford to be more liberal.","Blonde Venus"
"999",4989720,4991836,"I'll raise it to $1,000 a minute.","Blonde Venus"
"1000",4991920,4993831,"$10,000. How about it, Faraday?","Blonde Venus"
"1001",4993920,4996593,"I suppose you feel pretty goodthe way you can throw money around.","Blonde Venus"
"1002",4996680,4999194,"$10,000 for 10 minutesdoesn't mean very much to you, does it?","Blonde Venus"
"1003",4999280,5002670,"It doesn't mean anything to me. I canthrow money around the same as you can.","Blonde Venus"
"1004",5002760,5004955,"Let her come in for nothing.","Blonde Venus"
"1005",5010000,5011433,"Come in, Helen.","Blonde Venus"

"1051",5220640,5222392,"Yes, I went to a theatre.","Blonde Venus"
"1052",5222480,5226837,"And then you saw Mummy on the stageand she was very beautiful.","Blonde Venus"
"1053",5227720,5229870,"And then your heart went like this.","Blonde Venus"
"1054",5231560,5234028,"I didn't know much about womenin those days.","Blonde Venus"
"1055",5235560,5237232,"You're telling it all different.","Blonde Venus"

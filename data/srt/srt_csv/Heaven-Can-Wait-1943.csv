"1014",3745174,3748075,"It took you 10 years to find outthat we were right.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1015",3748177,3751874,"- If you'd listened to your mother-- And your father, things might have been different.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1016",3751981,3754882,"- I think I'd better be going.- Oh, you're getting touchy, huh?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1017",3754984,3757418,"Well, if anyone hasa right to be angry, it's us.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1018",3757520,3761081,"But we're willingto let bygones be bygones.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1019",3761190,3764751,"After all, we're not made of stone.If a daughter comes home and is sorry-","Heaven Can Wait"
"1020",3764861,3767352,"I'm not sorry,and I don't want your forgiveness.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1021",3767463,3769363,"Then what did you come home for?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1022",3769465,3772161,"I came here because I feltI wanted to see you.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1023",3772268,3775431,"- If you expect me to get down on my knees -- Now, now, now, now, forget it.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1024",3775538,3778871,"After all, you were young,and it probably was all the fault of that -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1025",3778975,3780875,"Please, Father.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1026",3780977,3784174,"I don't want to hear a single unpleasant wordabout the last 10 years, or I'll have to go.","Heaven Can Wait"

"1030",3796025,3798892,"It's all dead and buried,and let's forget it.","Heaven Can Wait"

"1036",3895491,3898289,"Jasper!","Heaven Can Wait"
"1037",3898394,3900794,"Jasper!What's all that noise about?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1038",3902398,3904298,"Just had a talk with Mr. Chuck.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1039",3904400,3907460,"He say somebody said they sawa couple of prowlers on the grounds.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1040",3907570,3910733,"- Maybe some of them horse thieves.- Well, tell Chuck to keep after 'em.","Heaven Can Wait"

"1044",3920182,3922082,"I'm getting pretty tired.Good night.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1045",3922184,3924084,"- Good night, Martha.- Good night, Mother.","Heaven Can Wait"

"1051",3945441,3948001,"And why not?Your troubles are actually over.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1052",3948110,3950510,"- I suppose you're right.- I know I am.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1053",3950613,3953275,"You paid for your mistakes,and paid dearly.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1054",3953382,3958081,"Now, I don't want anybody to get the impressionthat I've been the victim of 10 years of misery.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1055",3958187,3960087,"Nothing of the kind.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1056",3960189,3962623,"On the contrary, I can saythere were moments in my marriage...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1057",3962725,3965626,"which few women have beenlucky enough to have experienced.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1058",3965728,3968629,"- There were times when you were lifted way up to the sky...- Yes, way up.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1059",3968731,3970995,"only to be dropped way down afterward.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1060",3971100,3974797,"That's not the purpose of marriage.Marriage isn't a series of thrills.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1061",3974904,3979102,"Marriage is a peaceful, well-balancedadjustment of two right-thinking people.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1062",3979208,3981574,"I'm afraid that's only too true.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1063",3981677,3983577,"Well, good night, Albert.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1064",3983679,3988275,"Uh, Martha, there's... one other thoughtI want you to sleep with.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1065",3989318,3993049,"My feelings for youhave remained unchanged.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1066",3993155,3996056,"That's very kind of you, Albert,and I'm touched.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1067",3996158,3998558,"Naturally, I'm not the flashy type,like some people.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1068",3998661,4001562,"I'd say I was ratheron the conservative side.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1069",4001664,4005327,"If I were, for instance, a suit of clothes,you wouldn't call me a stylish cut.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1070",4005434,4007493,"And I prefer it that way.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1071",4007603,4011164,"But I can safely sayI'm made of solid material.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1072",4011273,4014800,"I'm sewed together carefullyand my lining is good, Martha.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1073",4014910,4017504,"Frankly, I believe I wear well.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1074",4017613,4020514,"I'm... not too hot in the summer...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1075",4020616,4023779,"and I give protection in the winter.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1076",4023886,4026286,"- Need I say more?- No, Albert.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1077",4026389,4030086,"You've given a completeand accurate description of yourself.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1078",4030192,4032820,"- Good night.- Thank you, Martha.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1079",4039635,4041535,"- Miss Martha?- Yes?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1080",4041637,4044037,"Excuse me.That horse thief we were looking for-","Heaven Can Wait"
"1081",4044140,4046040,"- Did you catch him?- Yes, ma'am.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1082",4046142,4048906,"- He's in your room waiting for you.- In my r-","Heaven Can Wait"
"1083",4049945,4052709,"- You mean -- Yes, miss. That's him.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1084",4063092,4065253,"Martha, darling, sweetheart -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1085",4066929,4070387,"How could you do a thing like this to me?Don't you realize what I went through?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1086",4070499,4072899,"- Oh, Henry-- Running away like that without a word!","Heaven Can Wait"
"1087",4073002,4074902,"Can't you imagine how I suffered?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1088",4075004,4078565,"How could you do this to me?Oh, Martha, Martha.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1089",4078674,4081142,"Henry, it won't work anymore.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1090",4082678,4085579,"- What's Albert doing here?- I met him by accident on the train.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1091",4085681,4088582,"- He was very nice to me, and -- Accident? You expect me to believe that?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1092",4088684,4091585,"Here I am, looking all over the worldfor my wife, going insane with despair.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1093",4091687,4095384,"And where do I find her? 2,000 miles awayin a lonely country place with another man.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1094",4095491,4098460,"- I don't see how I can stand any more.- Henry, it won't work.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1095",4099995,4101895,"Very well.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1096",4101997,4104898,"If it comes to the point wherea woman doubts her husband's sincerity...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1097",4105000,4106900,"there's nothing more to do.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1098",4107002,4108902,"Everything is over.Good-bye, Martha.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1099",4109004,4110972,"Good-bye, Henry.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1100",4117613,4120275,"Martha, I really mean this.I'm going.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1101",4120382,4122043,"I know you mean it, Henry.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1102",4123152,4125120,"All right.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1103",4128157,4132025,"Just give me five minutes to pull myself together,and you'll never see me again. Never, never.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1104",4132128,4134756,"Oh, Henry, I know your every move.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1105",4134864,4136957,"I know your outraged indignation.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1106",4137066,4139967,"I know the poor, weeping little boy.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1107",4140069,4143698,"I know the misunderstood,strong, silent man...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1108",4143806,4148243,"the wounded lion who's too proud to explainwhat happened in the jungle last night.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1109",4148344,4150244,"So, I'm a fake.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1110",4150346,4152246,"- I'm false, I'm cheap.- Oh, Henry, please -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1111",4152348,4154748,"- I know I've brought you nothing but unhappiness.- You know that's not true.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1112",4154850,4157250,"- Oh! So we had some good times together.- Some wonderful times.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1113",4157353,4160254,"Then what do you want? What did I do?Even a murderer has a right to defend himself.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1114",4160356,4162916,"You can't hang a man without evidence.- I know.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1115",4163025,4165926,"If I only knewwhat particular thing is in your mi -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1116",4166028,4167928,"- Have you seen Aunt Minetta recently?- Yes, of course.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1117",4168030,4169930,"Oh, well, now everything is clear.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1118",4170032,4172933,"This is something I didn't even want tomention to you, it's so unimportant.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1119",4173035,4175435,"When she saw me, yes,I was at the Plaza having tea...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1120",4175538,4178439,"and at the table with me was a very handsomeyoung woman, but there was nothing to it.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1121",4178541,4181442,"- I would have explained to you myself-- But you didn't want to make me uncomfortable.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1122",4181544,4184445,"- Even for one second.- That's right, darling. That's exactly right.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1123",4184547,4188210,"Henry, it won't work. And besides,Aunt Minetta didn't say one word about you.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1124",4188317,4191218,"- And as for the young lady at the Plaza -- Darling, I can easily explain that.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1125",4191320,4193447,"Oh, I know you can.You're a master at that.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1126",4193556,4195956,"All right, all right.I'm fighting a losing battle.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1127",4196058,4198959,"I don't love you. I never loved you.I love everybody in New York more than you.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1128",4199061,4202030,"There you go again.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1129",4207336,4209896,"It's the 25th of October.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1130",4210005,4211973,"Many happy returns.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1131",4216545,4218445,"Thank you, Martha...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1132",4218547,4221448,"but it's something much more importantthan my birthday.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1133",4221550,4223814,"It's our anniversary.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1134",4223919,4229084,"Ten years ago today, I was almostas much in love with you as I am right now.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1135",4229191,4233855,"It's very difficult for a woman to sendher husband away on their 10th anniversary...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1136",4233963,4236932,"especially when he speaksas beautifully as you do.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1137",4237967,4239867,"But I must do it.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1138",4239969,4242836,"All right, darling.I know it's all over.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1139",4243872,4247865,"I'm sure you'll find someone elsewho will be... really worthy of you.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1140",4249011,4250911,"But let's pretend...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1141",4251013,4252981,"just for a minute.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1142",4254016,4255984,"Happy anniversary.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1143",4259855,4261755,"Do you like it?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1144",4261857,4264485,"I'd say it cost at least $10,000.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1145",4265561,4268462,"For that money,it's a very good purchase.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1146",4268564,4271590,"Why, Martha,how can you talk like that?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1147",4271700,4274601,"If you'd only forgottento give me this bracelet...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1148",4274703,4278605,"I probably would have been foolish enoughto be in your arms right now.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1149",4278707,4281870,"You've no ideawhat a mistake you made.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1150",4281977,4284741,"The magicianplayed one trick too many.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1151",4286782,4290684,"The other day I was havinga new photograph made ofJackie and me.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1152",4290786,4293983,"I wanted to have it the right sizeto fit into your wallet.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1153",4295024,4297049,"So I slipped into your room.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1154",4297159,4299423,"This fell out of your wallet.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1155",4311674,4316077,"And I don't ever remember having receivedany bracelet from you on or about May 2.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1156",4316178,4318578,"Oh, so that's what it's all about.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1157",4318681,4321582,"And to think that you went through all thisjust because the jeweler made a mistake.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1158",4321684,4325085,"And that what the whole thing is - a mistake.Naturally, I didn't buy a bracelet for $500.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1159",4325187,4327985,"Has Cartier ever made a mistakein any of our bills before?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1160",4328090,4331457,"Darling, I love you. I think you're the mostbeautiful, adorable thing in all the world.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1161",4331560,4334461,"Do you really believe there's any womangood enough to take me away from you?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1162",4334563,4337225,"And if there were such a woman, do you thinkshe'd be worth only a $500 bracelet?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1163",4337333,4339233,"- Henry, I -- Darling, I'll make you a bet.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1164",4339335,4341735,"If Cartier doesn't admit thatthis whole thing is a terrible mistake -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1165",4341837,4344397,"- Then you won't buy there anymore.- Henry, it won't work.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1166",4344506,4347407,"- Grandpa!- Martha, my darling.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1167",4347509,4349977,"Come on, come on.Let's get started. Let's pack.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1168",4350079,4353571,"- Grandpa, what do you mean?- Naturally, you're going back with us to New York.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1169",4353682,4356583,"What are you standing there for?You're making a pretty bad job of it.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1170",4356685,4359586,"Come on, sweep her off her feet,or we'll miss the next train.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1171",4359688,4362088,"- If I can't make her happy, then I don't want her to come back.- Yeah, that's better.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1172",4362191,4364125,"- No, I mean this seriously.- That's why it's good.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1173",4364226,4366786,"Look, Martha, let's face it.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1174",4366895,4369796,"- You want a divorce.- I see no other way.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1175",4369898,4372298,"- What aboutJackie?- Naturally, I want him.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1176",4372401,4374801,"I think you're right.I think he should get away from me.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1177",4374903,4377303,"- I didn't mean it that way.- But I did.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1178",4377406,4379806,"I adore the boy, and thereforeI think he shouldn't be with me.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1179",4379908,4382809,"Well, I don't think a childshould be deprived of his father.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1180",4382911,4385311,"Do you want him to grow upto be another Henry Van Cleve...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1181",4385414,4388315,"and on his 36th birthday make his wifeas unhappy as I've made you?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1182",4388417,4391318,"- Are the rest of your things in the closet?- Yes.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1183",4391420,4394321,"For instance, do you knowwhat our littleJackie did the other day?","Heaven Can Wait"
"1184",4394423,4396823,"- What?- He bought some ice cream for a little girl.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1185",4396925,4399052,"What's wrong about that?I think it's charming.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1186",4399161,4402130,"But the girl he bought the ice cream forwas not the girl he should have bought it for.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1187",4402231,4403789,"- It wasn't?- No.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1188",4403899,4405560,"Little devil.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1189",4405667,4408568,"And when the one little girlfound out that the other girl -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1190",4408670,4411002,"Well, that boy got himselfinto such a mess.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1191",4411106,4413006,"Oh, if I only could have been there.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1192",4413108,4415770,"You should have seen our littleJackietrying to get himself out of that situation.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1193",4415878,4418403,"- Did he?- Yes.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1194",4418514,4420414,"Little girl likes him better than before.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1195",4420516,4423144,"Good. What a child.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1196",4423252,4426483,"- Believe me, he is a problem.- I suppose so.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1197",4426588,4428488,"But when he makes up his little stories -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1198",4428590,4431491,"And you know they're just little stories,but he wants you to believe them so badly...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1199",4431593,4433493,"that you wish you could...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1200",4433595,4435927,"and finally what can you do but -","Heaven Can Wait"
"1201",4444773,4446673,"Happy anniversary.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1202",4446775,4448675,"I'm still too confused.I've got to collect myself.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1203",4448777,4451177,"- Give her time to make up her mind.- She can do that on the train.","Heaven Can Wait"

"1671",6104198,6107099,"I can think of nothingmore dignified and homelike...","Heaven Can Wait"
"1672",6107201,6110932,"than sitting in front of a fireplaceand having someone read a fine book to me.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1673",6111038,6112938,"Something worthwhile.","Heaven Can Wait"

"1684",6188182,6190241,"That's natural.","Heaven Can Wait"
"1685",6190350,6193751,"But I think he should find someonecloser to his own age.","Heaven Can Wait"

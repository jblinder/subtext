"925",4442988,4444188,"All right, let's create 15 days.","The Martian"
"926",4444189,4445856,"13 days to mount the probe.","The Martian"
"927",4445858,4447525,"Can we reduce?","The Martian"
"928",4447527,4449661,"It actually only takes threedays to mount the probe.","The Martian"

"930",4451564,4453298,"I can get it down to two.","The Martian"
"931",4453300,4455000,"10 days are for tests and inspections.","The Martian"

"934",4460706,4462875,"Right now I'm asking howoften they reveal a problem.","The Martian"
"935",4462876,4464242,"One in 20.","The Martian"
"936",4464243,4465877,"But that's grounds for countdown halt.","The Martian"

"938",4467345,4469914,"Anyone else know a saferway to buy more time?","The Martian"
"939",4474019,4476621,"Dr. Keller, stretch Watney'srations four more days.","The Martian"

"1110",5059706,5060771,"We don't intercept withEarth at all...","The Martian"

"1113",5064577,5066779,"While we're doing that...","The Martian"

"1125",5090135,5091671,"Ow!","The Martian"

"1136",5126537,5128672,"What am I missing?Why is that important?","The Martian"
"1137",5128673,5130207,"Because we can only do one.","The Martian"
"1138",5130207,5132443,"Send Watney enough food tolast till Ares 4...","The Martian"
"1139",5132444,5135112,"or send Hermesback to get him right now.","The Martian"
"1140",5135113,5136146,"Both plans require theTaiyang Shen,","The Martian"
"1141",5136148,5138449,"so we have to choose.","The Martian"
"1142",5138451,5140085,"But what about the Hermes crew?","The Martian"
"1143",5140086,5141952,"We'd be asking them to add","The Martian"

"1145",5145457,5147497,"Yeah. They wouldn'thesitate, not for a second.","The Martian"
"1146",5148260,5150094,"Can the Hermes functionfor 533 days","The Martian"
"1147",5150095,5151296,"beyond the scheduled mission end?","The Martian"
"1148",5151296,5152463,"It should.","The Martian"
"1149",5152465,5154632,"Built to last the fullAres mission...","The Martian"
"1150",5154634,5157234,"so technically, it's onlyhalfway through its lifespan.","The Martian"
"1151",5157235,5158636,"But if something goes wrong...","The Martian"
"1152",5158637,5160471,"Then we lose the crew.","The Martian"
"1153",5160472,5161972,"So what? Weeither have a high chance","The Martian"
"1154",5161974,5164141,"of killing one person...","The Martian"

"1394",6049327,6051394,"Four and a halfbillion years...","The Martian"
"1395",6051395,6053563,"nobody here.","The Martian"
"1396",6053564,6056766,"And now, me.","The Martian"
"1397",6057868,6061640,"I'm the first person to bealone on an entire planet.","The Martian"
"1398",6076387,6078255,"How's he doing?","The Martian"
"1399",6079425,6081158,"So far, so good.","The Martian"
"1400",6081159,6083793,"He's sticking to schedule.","The Martian"
"1401",6083795,6086695,"Drives for four hoursbefore noon...","The Martian"
"1402",6086697,6088097,"lays the solar panels,","The Martian"
"1403",6088099,6090233,"waits 13 hours for themto recharge...","The Martian"
"1404",6090234,6094738,"and sleeps somewhere inthere and then starts again.","The Martian"
"1405",6096541,6097942,"How's he doing?","The Martian"
"1406",6099944,6102979,"He asked us to callhim Captain Blondebeard.","The Martian"
"1407",6104682,6106783,"Well, technically, Marswould be under maritime...","The Martian"
"1408",6106784,6108551,"Yeah, I know.He explained it to us.","The Martian"
"1409",6109988,6111622,"Where is he?","The Martian"
"1410",6112456,6113856,"- There.- Okay.","The Martian"
"1411",6113858,6115458,"Here.","The Martian"
"1412",6115460,6116927,"Okay.","The Martian"
"1413",6221365,6223466,"Okay, I'm gonna start bystating for the record","The Martian"
"1414",6223466,6225034,"that you're notgonna like this.","The Martian"
"1415",6225036,6226671,"Oh, yeah?","The Martian"
"1416",6227139,6229740,"Yeah, the problem isthe intercept velocity.","The Martian"
"1417",6229742,6234644,"The Hermes, well...It can't enter Mars' orbit.","The Martian"
"1418",6234645,6238014,"Otherwise, they'll never haveenough fuel to make it home.","The Martian"
"1419",6238015,6240048,"The MAV, that was only designed","The Martian"
"1420",6240050,6242719,"to get to low Mars orbit.","The Martian"
"1421",6242720,6246823,"So in order for Mark to escapeMars' gravity entirely...","The Martian"
"1422",6246823,6248391,"and to intercept theHermes...","The Martian"
"1423",6248393,6250393,"- He has to be going fast.- Exactly.","The Martian"
"1424",6250394,6252596,"Which means we need tomake the MAV lighter.","The Martian"
"1425",6252597,6255265,"A lot lighter.5,000 kilograms lighter.","The Martian"
"1426",6255265,6256699,"You can do that, right?","The Martian"
"1427",6256701,6258634,"There's some gimmesright off the bat.","The Martian"
"1428",6258635,6260237,"The design presumes500 kilograms","The Martian"
"1429",6260238,6261905,"of Martian soil and samples.","The Martian"
"1430",6261907,6263706,"Obviously we won't do that.","The Martian"
"1431",6263707,6267545,"And there's just onepassenger instead of six.","The Martian"
"1432",6267546,6270280,"With suits and gear,that's another 500?","The Martian"
"1433",6270282,6272548,"Ditch the life support,don't need it.","The Martian"
"1434",6272550,6274384,"And we'll get Mark to wearhis EVA suit the whole trip.","The Martian"
"1435",6274385,6276119,"Wait a second.If he's in his EVA suit,","The Martian"
"1436",6276121,6277454,"how is he gonna operatethe controls?","The Martian"
"1437",6277456,6279889,"Well, he won't.","The Martian"
"1438",6279890,6283759,"Martinez will pilot the MAVremotely from the Hermes.","The Martian"
"1439",6283760,6286663,"We've never had a manned shipcontrolled remotely before.","The Martian"
"1440",6287831,6290201,"But I am excited about","The Martian"
"1441",6290202,6292536,"the opportunities that affords.","The Martian"
"1442",6292537,6295003,"If we go remote, we canlose the control panels,","The Martian"
"1443",6295005,6296806,"the secondary and tertiarycomm systems.","The Martian"
"1444",6296807,6298106,"Wait a second.","The Martian"
"1445",6298108,6302179,"You want a remote-controlledascent with no backup comms?","The Martian"
"1446",6304215,6306850,"He's not even got to thebad stuff yet, Vincent.","The Martian"
"1447",6306851,6308518,"Let's skip to the bad stuff!","The Martian"
"1448",6308519,6310353,"We need to remove the nose airlock,","The Martian"
"1449",6310354,6313457,"the windows, and Hull Panel 19.","The Martian"
"1450",6314992,6316125,"You want to take the frontof the ship off?","The Martian"
"1451",6316126,6317693,"Sure.","The Martian"
"1452",6317694,6320596,"The nose airlock aloneis 400 kilograms.","The Martian"
"1453",6320597,6321963,"You want to send a man into space","The Martian"
"1454",6321965,6322966,"without the front of his ship?","The Martian"
"1455",6322966,6324703,"Well, no.","The Martian"
"1456",6325470,6328840,"We're gonna have himcover it with Hab canvas.","The Martian"
"1457",6329439,6333042,"Look, the hull's mostlythere to keep the air in.","The Martian"
"1458",6333043,6334610,"Mars' atmosphere is so thin,","The Martian"
"1459",6334612,6336412,"you don't need a lotof streamlining.","The Martian"
"1460",6336412,6337947,"By the time the ship'sgoing fast enough","The Martian"
"1461",6337948,6339750,"for air resistance to matter...","The Martian"
"1462",6339751,6342385,"it'll be high enough thatthere's practically no air.","The Martian"
"1463",6342386,6344820,"You wanna send him intospace under a tarp.","The Martian"
"1464",6344822,6347056,"Yes.","The Martian"
"1465",6347057,6348858,"Can I go on?","The Martian"
"1466",6348859,6350426,"No.","The Martian"

"1469",6361072,6362505,"- You know?- Mmm-hmm.","The Martian"

"1485",6423134,6424934,"Actually it's worse than that","The Martian"
"1486",6424935,6426970,"because I won't even beable to control the thing.","The Martian"
"1487",6426970,6429771,"And by the way, physicists,","The Martian"
"1488",6429773,6432542,"when describing thingslike acceleration...","The Martian"
"1489",6432543,6435046,"do not use the word ""fast.""","The Martian"

"1723",7262706,7264039,"It'll give us a good kick.","The Martian"

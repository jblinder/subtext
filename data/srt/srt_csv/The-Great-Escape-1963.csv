"454",2870351,2872550,"Why? It's only a two-man job.","The Great Escape"
"455",2872851,2876349,"Everybody in the camp is supposed toclear all escape attempts in advance","The Great Escape"
"456",2876650,2878949,"with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.","The Great Escape"

"459",2887547,2890646,"We sneak out at night to a spotI found near the wire - a blind spot.","The Great Escape"
"460",2891045,2894346,"Then we dig down, take the dirt,spread it on top so it won't make a pile,","The Great Escape"
"461",2894646,2896246,"and then straight out.","The Great Escape"
"462",2896445,2900244,"Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digsin front, pushes the dirt behind him.","The Great Escape"
"463",2900545,2904143,"I stash it behind me, then we burrowthrough the dirt like a couple of moles.","The Great Escape"
"464",2904443,2909143,"By dawn we're under the wire, acrossthe open space, into the woods and gone.","The Great Escape"
"465",2915742,2916840,"Well...","The Great Escape"
"466",2919739,2922139,"When do you intend to try this?","The Great Escape"

"468",2925940,2930338,"Hilts, this may not be quitethe right time for this sort of thing.","The Great Escape"
"469",2930639,2933838,"Look, sir, I've been in the bagnearly three years now,","The Great Escape"
"470",2934038,2936237,"bloody close to being wire-happy.","The Great Escape"

"477",2963032,2964931,"Good night, sir.","The Great Escape"
"478",2970731,2973630,"Now, why didn't anybodythink of that before?","The Great Escape"
"479",2973929,2977228,"It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.","The Great Escape"
"480",2977429,2980329,"But it'll bring every goonin the camp down on top of us.","The Great Escape"
"481",2980528,2982827,"I don't know.Perhaps we're being too clever.","The Great Escape"
"482",2983027,2984927,"If we stop all the breakouts,","The Great Escape"
"483",2985226,2988626,"it may only convince the goonsthat we must be tunnelling.","The Great Escape"
"484",2988925,2994326,"I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're goingto be in the cooler for an awful long time.","The Great Escape"
"485",3040217,3043117,"- Good, huh?- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.","The Great Escape"

"488",3063110,3066010,"Maybe we could put it under the huts.The dirt's dark there.","The Great Escape"
"489",3066311,3069710,"It's the first place the ferrets would look.I saw one measuring yesterday.","The Great Escape"
"490",3069911,3072210,"Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.","The Great Escape"
"491",3072409,3076208,"- There are 50 tons of it.- I was just thinking out loud.","The Great Escape"
"492",3076608,3079708,"If you must think,for God's sake, think clearly.","The Great Escape"
"493",3080909,3082907,"Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?","The Great Escape"
"494",3084407,3087706,"We can't destroy the dirtand we can't eat it.","The Great Escape"
"495",3087905,3091005,"The only thing left to do is camouflage it.","The Great Escape"
"496",3091306,3093905,"That's as far as my thinking takes me.","The Great Escape"
"497",3095204,3097505,"Didn't they teach youpromptness in the RN?","The Great Escape"
"498",3097704,3100603,"You'll never believe it,but I think I have the solution.","The Great Escape"
"499",3100903,3104902,"The problem is somehow to get rid ofthis tunnel dirt over the compound.","The Great Escape"
"500",3105302,3107103,"Well, of course.","The Great Escape"
"501",3107802,3109702,"Would you mind?","The Great Escape"

"503",3123199,3126699,"you fill these bagswith the dirt from the tunnel.","The Great Escape"
"504",3126898,3130097,"Then, wearing them inside your trousers,","The Great Escape"
"505",3130398,3132597,"you wander out into the compound","The Great Escape"
"506",3132797,3136697,"where you pull thesestrings in your pockets.","The Great Escape"
"507",3137797,3139996,"Out come the pins.","The Great Escape"
"508",3142795,3147695,"- Eric, it's good.- All you have to do is kick it in.","The Great Escape"

"510",3150793,3153693,"It's indecently brilliant.What do you think, Roger?","The Great Escape"
"511",3154092,3157992,"- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.- I already have. It works.","The Great Escape"
"512",3159891,3162391,"Mac, this is what we'll do.","The Great Escape"

"997",6102291,6106591,"But once we get past that wire and havethem looking all over Germany for us,","The Great Escape"

"1016",6168878,6170677,"I can't answer you.","The Great Escape"
"1017",6172176,6173877,"But I can tell you","The Great Escape"
"1018",6174377,6177976,"a blind man is an unnecessary hazardto himself and the whole plan,","The Great Escape"
"1019",6178176,6180975,"and must therefore beeliminated from the operation.","The Great Escape"
"1020",6192172,6197172,"Colin's not a blind man as longas he's with me, and he's going with me.","The Great Escape"

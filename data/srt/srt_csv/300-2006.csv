"232",1656369,1658619,"- This is a surprise.- Silence!","300"
"233",1661059,1663839,"We heard Spartawas on the warpath.","300"
"234",1663839,1665920,"We were eager to join forces.","300"
"235",1665920,1670400,"If it is blood you seek,you're welcome to join us.","300"
"236",1670400,1673490,"But you bring only this handfulof soldiers against Xerxes?","300"
"237",1673809,1677359,"I see I was wrong to expect Sparta'scommitment to at least match our own.","300"
"238",1678599,1679990,"Doesn't it?","300"
"239",1681970,1683690,"You there.","300"

"276",1963819,1965599,"They cannot be killedor defeated.","300"
"277",1967210,1968309,"Not this darkness.","300"
"278",1969059,1970440,"Not these Immortals.","300"

"294",2054590,2055869,"Come.","300"
"295",2057960,2059400,"True.","300"
"296",2064199,2066369,"It does look like rain.","300"

"305",2135869,2139920,"I'm afraid gossip and protocol arethe least of my worries now, councilman.","300"
"306",2142739,2144610,"Such secrecy needed.","300"
"307",2144610,2146929,"How am I to trustbeyond the walls of my own home?","300"
"308",2147349,2150969,"Even here, Theron has eyes and earswhich fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.","300"
"309",2151260,2154750,"You speak as if all Spartaconspires against you.","300"
"310",2155170,2157829,"I wish they wereonly against me.","300"
"311",2160070,2163360,"Many on our council would voteto give all we have","300"
"312",2163360,2165469,"and follow Leonidas.","300"
"313",2165739,2168250,"But you must show them favor.","300"
"314",2169969,2172530,"And you can arrange meto speak to the council?","300"
"315",2172530,2174789,"If it is reason they want,I will let them know.","300"
"316",2175360,2177550,"Know what, my queen?","300"
"317",2177550,2179920,"Freedom isn't free at all.","300"
"318",2179920,2182170,"That it comes withthe highest of costs.","300"
"319",2182170,2184090,"The cost of blood.","300"
"320",2185599,2188449,"I will do my best to gatherour council","300"
"321",2188760,2192190,"and its chambers shall be filledwith your voice.","300"
"322",2192869,2194710,"- I'm in your debt.- Nope.","300"
"323",2195010,2198340,"Leonidas is my kingas well as yours.","300"

"325",2227000,2228480,"How can this be?","300"
"326",2228480,2232050,"We saw but a fraction of the monsterthat is Xerxes' army.","300"
"327",2232449,2234380,"There can be no victory here.","300"
"328",2238619,2240280,"Why do you smile?","300"
"329",2242190,2247280,"Arcadian, I've foughtcountless times","300"
"330",2247280,2249880,"yet I've never met an adversarythat could offer me","300"
"331",2249880,2253030,"what we Spartans calla beautiful death.","300"
"332",2253550,2254980,"I can only hope,","300"
"333",2254980,2258170,"with all the world's warriorsgathered against us,","300"
"334",2258170,2262309,"there might be one down therewho's up to the task.","300"
"335",2273309,2275050,"Move!","300"
"336",2276739,2278650,"Keep going, you dogs.","300"
"337",2287329,2288989,"Move!","300"
"338",2290949,2293019,"Forward I say.","300"
"339",2295929,2297670,"Stop here!","300"
"340",2298000,2299530,"Who commands here?","300"
"341",2302670,2308400,"I am the emissaryto the ruler of all the world.","300"
"342",2308400,2310789,"The god of gods.","300"
"343",2310789,2312730,"King of kings.","300"
"344",2312730,2318489,"And by that authority, I demand thatsomeone show me your commander.","300"
"345",2321820,2327820,"Listen. Do you think the paltrydozen you slew scares us?","300"
"346",2327820,2331989,"These hills swarmwith our scouts.","300"
"347",2331989,2335179,"And do you think yourpathetic wall","300"
"348",2335179,2337800,"will do anything except fall","300"
"349",2337800,2342110,"like a heap of dry leavesin the face...","300"
"350",2354659,2357519,"Our ancestors built this wall,","300"
"351",2357519,2361579,"using ancient stonesfrom the bosom of Greece herself.","300"
"352",2362119,2364619,"And with a little Spartan help,","300"
"353",2364619,2367369,"your Persian scoutssupplied the mortar.","300"
"354",2367369,2372099,"You will pay for yourbarbarism.","300"
"355",2390880,2392019,"My arm!","300"
"356",2394750,2397099,"It's not yours anymore.","300"
"357",2397099,2401619,"Go now. Run along and tell yourXerxes he faces free men here.","300"
"358",2401619,2405179,"Not slaves.Do it quickly.","300"
"359",2405179,2408329,"Before we decide to make our walljust a little bit bigger.","300"
"360",2408559,2413079,"No, not slaves.","300"
"361",2414500,2418110,"Your women will be slaves.","300"
"362",2418110,2422409,"Your sons, your daughters,your elders","300"
"363",2422409,2425730,"will be slaves, but not you.","300"
"364",2426900,2431460,"By noon this day,you will be dead men.","300"
"365",2432070,2437420,"A thousand nations of thePersian Empire descend upon you.","300"
"366",2438530,2442159,"Our arrows will blot out the sun.","300"
"367",2443849,2446300,"Then we will fight in the shade.","300"
"368",2448110,2449550,"The wall is solid.","300"
"369",2450059,2452800,"It'll do the job of funnelingthe Persians into the Hot Gates.","300"
"370",2453440,2456380,"Captain, have the men found any routethrough the hills to our back?","300"
"371",2456380,2458190,"None, sire.","300"
"372",2458869,2460809,"There is such a route,good king.","300"
"373",2461099,2463039,"Just past that western ridge.","300"
"374",2463480,2465239,"It's an old goat path.","300"
"375",2465239,2467769,"The Persians could use itto outflank us.","300"
"376",2468340,2470590,"Not one step closer.","300"
"377",2471289,2472340,"Monster!","300"
"378",2473280,2477199,"Wise king, I humbly requestan audience.","300"
"379",2477199,2478829,"I'll skewer you whereyou stand.","300"
"380",2478829,2481780,"I gave no such order.","300"
"381",2491349,2494860,"Forgive the captain.He's a good soldier.","300"
"382",2495230,2497880,"But a bit short on manners.","300"
"383",2498110,2501219,"There is nothingto forgive, brave king.","300"
"384",2501219,2502610,"I know what I look like.","300"
"385",2502610,2504550,"You wear the crimson of a Spartan.","300"
"386",2504929,2510000,"I am Ephialtes,born of Sparta.","300"
"387",2511210,2515389,"My mother's love ledmy parents to flee Sparta","300"
"388",2515389,2517380,"lest I be discarded.","300"
"389",2517760,2519599,"But your shield?","300"
"390",2519599,2521119,"And armor?","300"
"391",2521449,2523380,"My father's, sir.","300"
"392",2524519,2527039,"I beg you, bold king,","300"
"393",2527250,2531360,"to permit me to redeemmy father's name","300"
"394",2531360,2533969,"by serving youin combat.","300"
"395",2533969,2537199,"My father trained meto feel no fear.","300"
"396",2537199,2541239,"To make spear and shieldand sword as much a part of me","300"
"397",2541239,2543119,"as my own beating heart.","300"
"398",2543119,2546409,"I will earn my father's armor,noble king,","300"
"399",2546610,2549079,"by serving youin the battle.","300"
"400",2554059,2555630,"Fine thrust.","300"
"401",2556199,2558719,"I will kill many Persians.","300"
"402",2563760,2566519,"- Raise your shield.- Sire?","300"
"403",2566750,2569130,"Raise your shieldas high as you can.","300"
"404",2576409,2580159,"Your father should have told youhow our phalanx works.","300"
"405",2580159,2585179,"We fight as a single,impenetrable unit.","300"
"406",2585179,2588260,"That is the sourceof our strength.","300"
"407",2588570,2592090,"Each Spartan protectsthe man to his left,","300"
"408",2592449,2595849,"from thigh to neck,with his shield.","300"
"409",2596239,2600869,"A single weakspotand the phalanx shatters.","300"
"410",2602070,2605960,"From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.","300"
"411",2607280,2609489,"I am sorry, my friend.","300"
"412",2609489,2611989,"But not all of us are madeto be soldiers.","300"
"413",2611989,2612670,"But I...","300"
"414",2612670,2614820,"If you want to helpat a Spartan victory...","300"
"415",2614820,2616889,"- Yes?- Clear the battlefield of the dead.","300"
"416",2616889,2619130,"Tend to wounded,bring them water.","300"
"417",2619329,2620949,"Why?","300"
"418",2620949,2625800,"But as for the fight itself,I cannot use you.","300"
"419",2636800,2641380,"Mother, father,you were wrong.","300"
"420",2644030,2647570,"You are wrong, Leonidas.","300"
"421",2648369,2649960,"You are wrong.","300"
"422",2651130,2653559,"Dispatch the Phociansto the goat path.","300"
"423",2653820,2657699,"Pray to the gods nobodytells the Persians about it.","300"
"424",2663949,2664980,"Earthquake.","300"

"528",3548710,3553320,"It is my divine power.But I'm a generous god.","300"
"529",3553570,3555929,"I can make you rich beyondall measure.","300"
"530",3556150,3558670,"I will make you warlordof all Greece.","300"

"539",3592019,3598880,"Slaughtering of all those men of yourshas left a nasty cramp in my legs.","300"
"540",3598880,3601639,"So kneeling will be hardfor me.","300"
"541",3601639,3604929,"There will be no gloryin your sacrifice.","300"
"542",3605190,3608909,"I will erase even the memoryof Sparta from the histories.","300"

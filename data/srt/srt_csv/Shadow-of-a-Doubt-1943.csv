"804",2727308,2728642,"they should have it.","Shadow of a Doubt"
"805",2728893,2732020,"Well, we'll...The whole idea of

"807",2735900,2737901,"We'll do anythingyou say, of course,","Shadow of a Doubt"
"808",2737985,2739986,"but this familyseemed right and...","Shadow of a Doubt"
"809",2740071,2741238,"It is a nice family.","Shadow of a Doubt"
"810",2741364,2744616,"Charlie, why don't youlet the young men go ahead,

"827",2784949,2786241,"Oh, you mean,what does he do?","Shadow of a Doubt"
"828",2786325,2788827,"Oh, he's just in business.You know, the way men are.","Shadow of a Doubt"
"829",2788911,2790954,"My husband now,he works in a bank,","Shadow of a Doubt"

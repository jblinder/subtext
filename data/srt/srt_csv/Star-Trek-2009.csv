"908",4820746,4824815,"Ok? Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing. Forsomething that was clearly an accident.","Star Trek"

"916",4843742,4847791,"You are in fact a Mr. Scott who postulatedthe theory of transwarp beaming?","Star Trek"
"917",4847792,4850841,"That's what I'm talking about.How'd ya think I wound up here?","Star Trek"
"918",4851291,4852999,"I had a little debate with my instructor","Star Trek"
"919",4853000,4856587,"on the issue of relativistic physics andhow it pertains to subspace travel.","Star Trek"
"920",4856588,4860521,"He seemed to think that the range oftransporting something like a grapefruit","Star Trek"
"921",4860522,4862440,"was limited to about a 100 miles.","Star Trek"
"922",4862441,4866141,"I told him that I could not only beam agrapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet","Star Trek"
"923",4866142,4868778,"in the same system, which is easy by the way","Star Trek"
"924",4868779,4870594,"I could do it with a life form.","Star Trek"
"925",4871195,4873579,"So, I tested it on admiral Archer's prize beagle.","Star Trek"
"926",4873580,4875183,"I know that dog. What happened to it?","Star Trek"
"927",4875692,4878946,"I'll tell you when it reappears. I don'tknow. I do feel guilty about that.","Star Trek"
"928",4878947,4881851,"What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct?","Star Trek"
"929",4881852,4885056,"That it is indeed possible to beam ontoa ship that is travelling at warp speed?","Star Trek"
"930",4885057,4887578,"I think that if that equation had beendiscovered I'd have heard about it.","Star Trek"
"931",4887579,4889558,"The reason you haven'theard of it, Mr. Scott,","Star Trek"
"932",4889559,4891835,"is because you haven't discovered it yet.","Star Trek"
"933",4897167,4900937,"- Are you from the future?- He is. I'm not.","Star Trek"
"934",4900938,4903616,"Well that's brilliant. Do they stillhave sandwiches there?","Star Trek"
"935",4904557,4906621,"Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.","Star Trek"

"937",4909438,4910852,"In you go.","Star Trek"
"938",4911615,4913704,"So, the Enterprise has had it'smaiden voyage, has it?","Star Trek"
"939",4913705,4915483,"She is one well endowed lady.","Star Trek"
"940",4915484,4919439,"I'd like to get my hands on her ample nossels,if you'd pardon the engineering parlance.","Star Trek"

"942",4925538,4929808,"Which I don't, by the way. We're stilltalking about beaming aboard the Enterprise","Star Trek"
"943",4929809,4932616,"while she's travelling faster than lightwithout a proper receiving pad.","Star Trek"
"944",4932617,4935102,"Get off there. It's not a climbing frame.","Star Trek"
"945",4935632,4936930,"The notion of transwarp beaming","Star Trek"
"946",4936931,4940209,"is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet","Star Trek"
"947",4940210,4943130,"whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.","Star Trek"
"948",4943131,4944143,"What's that?","Star Trek"
"949",4944144,4947327,"Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.","Star Trek"
"950",4949532,4951378,"You're out of it...","Star Trek"
"951",4954669,4958570,"Imagine that. It never occurred to me tothink of space as the thing that was moving","Star Trek"
"952",4959131,4961118,"You're coming with us, right?","Star Trek"
"953",4962923,4965149,"No, Jim. That is not my destiny.","Star Trek"

"955",4968003,4970537,"He. The other Spock is not gonna believe me.Only you can explain what the hell has happened.","Star Trek"
"956",4970538,4974689,"Under no circumstances can he be made awareof my existence. You must promise me that.","Star Trek"
"957",4974690,4978999,"So you're telling me I can't tell you that I'm followingyou're own orders. Why not? What happens?","Star Trek"
"958",4979000,4981326,"Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.","Star Trek"
"959",4981327,4984984,"To stop Nero, you alone musttake command of your ship.","Star Trek"
"960",4984985,4986725,"How? Over your dead body?","Star Trek"
"961",4986726,4987879,"Preferably, not.","Star Trek"
"962",4987880,4990777,"However, there is Starfleet regulation 619.","Star Trek"

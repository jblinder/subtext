"1739",6694938,6696731,"it's exceedingly simple.","Inside Man"
"1740",6697107,6698566,"Because I can.","Inside Man"
"1741",6699651,6701819,"Which leaves us only with the ""how.""","Inside Man"
"1742",6702738,6705782,"And therein, as the Bard would tell us,","Inside Man"

"1768",6892553,6894178,"I did it for the money.","Inside Man"

"1824",7062139,7064259,"Give me a straight answer.What do you think happened?","Inside Man"

"1838",7097299,7099258,"I mean, going all the way back to 1948.","Inside Man"
"1839",7099342,7102470,"So I started thinking.Who would have the answer to this riddle?","Inside Man"
"1840",7102554,7104430,"Probably the man who forgot to mention","Inside Man"
"1841",7104514,7106807,"that he built the bankin the first place in 1948.","Inside Man"
"1842",7106892,7109643,"It doesn't add up, Mr. Case.It does not add up.","Inside Man"

"145",941566,943066,"has gone down without a fight.","Jack Reacher"
"146",943692,945192,"Oh, I get it.","Jack Reacher"

"151",955413,957205,"You haven't even seen the evidence.","Jack Reacher"
"152",961543,963253,"Is this a privileged conversation?","Jack Reacher"
"153",963379,967090,"Of course, it's a client conference.Nothing you say here can be repeated.","Jack Reacher"
"154",969259,971845,"There are four types of peoplewho join the military.","Jack Reacher"
"155",971928,973721,"For some, it's a family trade.","Jack Reacher"
"156",974222,976557,"Others are patriots, eager to serve.","Jack Reacher"
"157",976893,978894,"Next, you have thosewho just need a job.","Jack Reacher"
"158",979729,983398,"Then there's the kind who want a legalmeans of killing other people.","Jack Reacher"
"159",983899,985734,"James Barr was one of those.","Jack Reacher"
"160",986568,988070,"He made sniper.","Jack Reacher"
"161",988403,991405,"Trained hard.Two thousand rounds a week.","Jack Reacher"
"162",991865,993866,"And with every shot,he's taught to visualise","Jack Reacher"
"163",993951,996536,"the base of a man's skullthrough his reticle.","Jack Reacher"
"164",996745,999581,"The sweet spot wherethe medulla meets the spine.","Jack Reacher"
"165",1000750,1003250,"Visualise that puff of pink mist.","Jack Reacher"
"166",1005087,1006922,"Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.","Jack Reacher"
"167",1007255,1008923,"He's put on overwatch.","Jack Reacher"
"168",1009549,1012469,"All day longhe stares through a scope at civilians.","Jack Reacher"
"169",1013096,1014261,"Women.","Jack Reacher"
"170",1014596,1015639,"Children.","Jack Reacher"
"171",1016099,1018767,"Day in, day out, for two long years","Jack Reacher"
"172",1018893,1021894,"without ever once beingcleared to fire a single shot.","Jack Reacher"
"173",1022938,1024772,"Then comes the drawdown.","Jack Reacher"
"174",1025775,1027401,"For James Barr, the war's over.","Jack Reacher"
"175",1028443,1030278,"Two thousand rounds a week.","Jack Reacher"
"176",1030613,1034240,"A quarter million rounds in his career,not one at a human target.","Jack Reacher"
"177",1035117,1037618,"You've been hungry.You've been horny.","Jack Reacher"
"178",1037953,1040288,"You've had an itch you can't scratch.","Jack Reacher"
"179",1040789,1044792,"Imagine that feeling.Days. Weeks. Years.","Jack Reacher"
"180",1045127,1049131,"Imagine that feeling times 200,000,plus 50,000 more.","Jack Reacher"
"181",1049464,1053343,"Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deckand tomorrow you're going home","Jack Reacher"
"182",1053469,1055429,"and you know if you don'tscratch that itch now,","Jack Reacher"
"183",1055512,1057138,"you never will.","Jack Reacher"
"184",1057472,1059141,"You need a release.","Jack Reacher"
"185",1059808,1061308,"You need a target.","Jack Reacher"
"186",1061644,1064604,"And the who of itnever once enters your mind.","Jack Reacher"
"187",1081830,1083832,"He covered his tracks well,","Jack Reacher"
"188",1083958,1085625,"just like sane people do.","Jack Reacher"
"189",1086294,1090963,"He almost got away with it, too.But I caught him. And he confessed.","Jack Reacher"
"190",1091173,1092840,"So why didn't he go to prison?","Jack Reacher"
"191",1093843,1097261,"What Barr didn't know that day was thefour civilian contractors he'd picked off","Jack Reacher"
"192",1097346,1100682,"just spent the weekendat what they call a rape-rally.","Jack Reacher"
"193",1101183,1104853,"It was 28 women,ages 54 on down to 11.","Jack Reacher"
"194",1105688,1108856,"Those were just the ones I could findbefore the case was shut down.","Jack Reacher"
"195",1109192,1112027,"See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.","Jack Reacher"
"196",1112361,1115697,"And after seven long yearsof ""Mission Accomplished,""","Jack Reacher"
"197",1116031,1119366,"someone in the corporation just wantedthe whole thing to end quietly.","Jack Reacher"
"198",1119868,1123371,"So they chalked it up to the fog of war,made the murders go away.","Jack Reacher"
"199",1123705,1125832,"This is classified information.","Jack Reacher"
"200",1127210,1128876,"And that's why the privilege.","Jack Reacher"
"201",1129211,1131212,"But you were readyto tell this to the D.A.","Jack Reacher"
"202",1131547,1135258,"The last time I saw Barr,I made him a promise.","Jack Reacher"
"203",1136051,1139221,"And when I saw his name on the news,I came here to keep it.","Jack Reacher"
"204",1140388,1143098,"- But now I know I don't have to.- How can you be sure?","Jack Reacher"
"205",1143726,1145727,"You still haven't seen the evidence.","Jack Reacher"
"206",1146061,1149815,"Your father has.And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.","Jack Reacher"
"207",1149898,1152400,"Barr's not getting awaywith murder again.","Jack Reacher"
"208",1153361,1154402,"He might.","Jack Reacher"
"209",1155238,1158240,"He suffered a severe brain injuryin state custody.","Jack Reacher"
"210",1158406,1160157,"When he wakes up, if he wakes up,","Jack Reacher"
"211",1160242,1163036,"he may not remember the event,he may not remember anything at all.","Jack Reacher"
"212",1164413,1167749,"And this case won't be aboutJames Barr's guilt or innocence.","Jack Reacher"
"213",1168084,1171126,"It'll be about his ability to stand trial.","Jack Reacher"
"214",1171921,1176423,"After everything I just told you,you still want to defend him?","Jack Reacher"
"215",1176550,1178593,"I want to see he gets a fair trial.","Jack Reacher"
"216",1180429,1183265,"You said he confessed in Baghdad.","Jack Reacher"
"217",1183891,1185432,"He didn't confess this time.","Jack Reacher"
"218",1185726,1187894,"- This time he knows better.- This time he asked for you.","Jack Reacher"
"219",1189063,1191230,"I want to know why.","Jack Reacher"
"220",1191315,1194358,"You want to know why.I can see it's eating you.","Jack Reacher"
"221",1194442,1196027,"And you can't ask Barr,","Jack Reacher"

"690",3215253,3216336,"Where can I find Jeb?","Jack Reacher"
"691",3216880,3218505,"I don't know.He didn't come to work today.","Jack Reacher"
"692",3218590,3219882,"So he works here.","Jack Reacher"
"693",3220384,3221550,"Yeah.","Jack Reacher"
"694",3222887,3225554,"It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.","Jack Reacher"

"696",3230393,3231894,"I'm really sorry, mister.","Jack Reacher"
"697",3233230,3235565,"You were supposed to be a pervert.","Jack Reacher"

"700",3242907,3246659,"When Jeb asks, you do what he says.","Jack Reacher"
"701",3251248,3252581,"Am I in trouble?","Jack Reacher"
"702",3255668,3257420,"Not if you lend me your car.","Jack Reacher"

"704",3261507,3262717,"I'm guessing you're the Camaro.","Jack Reacher"
"705",3262800,3265719,"That whimsy little pickuphas Gary written all over it. Keys?","Jack Reacher"

"715",3305052,3306385,"You're pretty.","Jack Reacher"
"716",3307471,3308887,"You're obviously sharp,","Jack Reacher"
"717",3309056,3310639,"doing Gary's books for him.","Jack Reacher"
"718",3311641,3313893,"You don't have tolet these guys use you.","Jack Reacher"
"719",3316896,3319481,"It's just what girls like me do.","Jack Reacher"
"720",3323737,3324778,"You got money?","Jack Reacher"
"721",3326114,3327155,"A little.","Jack Reacher"
"722",3328409,3329992,"Get out of town for a couple of days.","Jack Reacher"
"723",3330494,3331536,"Why?","Jack Reacher"
"724",3333831,3335664,"Get out of town, Sandy.","Jack Reacher"
"725",3380376,3381418,"Is Jeb home?","Jack Reacher"

"727",3396559,3397893,"I see.","Jack Reacher"
"728",3399980,3401563,"Well, if you don't mind...","Jack Reacher"
"729",3529067,3531527,"Get him! Get him! Get him!","Jack Reacher"

"732",3544081,3545666,"All right.","Jack Reacher"
"733",3605476,3606811,"Don't move.","Jack Reacher"
"734",3607478,3608813,"I'll tell you what.","Jack Reacher"
"735",3609481,3612148,"When I move, you pull the trigger.","Jack Reacher"
"736",3615653,3617697,"- Where's Jeb?- He's not here.","Jack Reacher"
"737",3617822,3619114,"Where can I find him?","Jack Reacher"
"738",3619199,3620740,"Jesus! My hand!","Jack Reacher"
"739",3620826,3623034,"Well, you shouldn't play with guns.Where can I find him?","Jack Reacher"
"740",3623286,3626163,"You're the one driving his car. You tell...","Jack Reacher"
"741",3626831,3629125,"The last I saw him,we was all leaving jail.","Jack Reacher"
"742",3629208,3630793,"He said he had to see a guy.","Jack Reacher"
"743",3630960,3632628,"- What guy? Who?- I don't know.","Jack Reacher"
"744",3632795,3634130,"I don't know, I swear.","Jack Reacher"
"745",3634338,3636673,"Next I know,his mom woke up from a bender","Jack Reacher"
"746",3636800,3638009,"and his shit's all gone.","Jack Reacher"
"747",3638342,3640469,"Is he the sort to light out like that?","Jack Reacher"
"748",3640637,3643097,"No, no, man.He'd never leave his moms alone.","Jack Reacher"
"749",3643181,3644431,"Shit ain't right.","Jack Reacher"
"750",3644516,3646309,"- Got a car?- It's outside.","Jack Reacher"
"751",3646518,3647559,"Keys.","Jack Reacher"
"752",3647811,3649353,"My hand, man. They're in my pock...","Jack Reacher"
"753",3649521,3650855,"Okay, okay.","Jack Reacher"
"754",3657820,3659362,"Now look at your friends.","Jack Reacher"
"755",3659989,3661197,"Now look at my face.","Jack Reacher"
"756",3663034,3665202,"Do you ever want to see me again?","Jack Reacher"
"757",3665996,3667038,"No way.","Jack Reacher"
"758",3668373,3670041,"Am I stealing your car?","Jack Reacher"
"759",3670876,3674378,"Use it as long as you like.","Jack Reacher"
"760",3675672,3677047,"You're very kind.","Jack Reacher"
"761",3702407,3703949,"I think Jeb Oliver's dead.","Jack Reacher"
"762",3704492,3707536,"- Who's Jeb Oliver?- He was the guy from the bar.","Jack Reacher"
"763",3709081,3711414,"Jesus, how hard did you hit him?","Jack Reacher"
"764",3712250,3714585,"What? No, not me.","Jack Reacher"
"765",3715420,3717045,"No, he was murdered.","Jack Reacher"
"766",3717130,3719005,"And someone tried to make itlook like he left town.","Jack Reacher"
"767",3719090,3720590,"Well, maybe he just left town.","Jack Reacher"
"768",3720717,3722385,"You pack your shower curtainwhen you travel?","Jack Reacher"
"769",3722594,3724637,"Is this what you baseyour conclusions on?","Jack Reacher"
"770",3724762,3726554,"What is that on your head?","Jack Reacher"
"771",3733230,3734605,"You don't want to know.","Jack Reacher"
"772",3736983,3739568,"You said on the phoneyou wanted to submit your findings.","Jack Reacher"
"773",3742114,3745449,"James Barr was a sniper.Not the best, not the worst.","Jack Reacher"
"774",3745742,3747451,"But he trained non-stop for two years.","Jack Reacher"
"775",3747577,3748786,"What does training like that do?","Jack Reacher"
"776",3748954,3750829,"What does any training do?","Jack Reacher"
"777",3750956,3753791,"Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.You do without thinking.","Jack Reacher"
"778",3753916,3757460,"It also makes people who aren'tnecessarily smart seem smart","Jack Reacher"
"779",3757753,3759963,"by beating sometactical awareness into them.","Jack Reacher"
"780",3760257,3762465,"Now, 99% of the evidenceyour father has against Barr","Jack Reacher"
"781",3762592,3764135,"didn't exist in Baghdad,","Jack Reacher"
"782",3764260,3767179,"not because Barr was smart,but because he was trained.","Jack Reacher"
"783",3767764,3771434,"See, from that garage,the shooter had the sun in his eyes.","Jack Reacher"
"784",3771601,3774644,"Targets were moving left and right.It's difficult conditions for any sniper.","Jack Reacher"
"785",3774771,3777398,"But Baghdad, you said Barrwas in a parking garage then.","Jack Reacher"
"786",3777481,3780192,"Because in Baghdad,the sun's behind him.","Jack Reacher"
"787",3780443,3783153,"Targets coming straight ahead,single file.","Jack Reacher"
"788",3783530,3786030,"Ideal conditionsfor even an average shooter","Jack Reacher"
"789",3787117,3788826,"and the exact same conditions","Jack Reacher"
"790",3788994,3791369,"he would've hadup on that highway bridge.","Jack Reacher"
"791",3792289,3795498,"Up there, he would never evenhave to get out of the van.","Jack Reacher"
"792",3797001,3798501,"No parking meter.","Jack Reacher"
"793",3798670,3799711,"No camera.","Jack Reacher"
"794",3800172,3804215,"No trace evidence left behind.And his escape is assured.","Jack Reacher"
"795",3804342,3806010,"Now, I'm not sayingthat he couldn't have killed","Jack Reacher"
"796",3806135,3808512,"those people at the river,but he wouldn't have.","Jack Reacher"
"797",3808597,3809637,"Not that way.","Jack Reacher"
"798",3809722,3811181,"- So you're saying he's crazy.- No.","Jack Reacher"
"799",3811307,3813266,"Well, what exactly are you saying?","Jack Reacher"
"800",3813351,3817021,"Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.But all of it?","Jack Reacher"
"801",3817146,3819731,"Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,I mean...","Jack Reacher"
"802",3819858,3821858,"And who the hell pays for parking?","Jack Reacher"
"803",3822027,3824695,"Sane or crazy,that just doesn't make sense.","Jack Reacher"
"804",3824820,3829492,"Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caughtand he wanted you to catch him.","Jack Reacher"
"805",3830327,3832369,"That would not explain how Barr,","Jack Reacher"
"806",3833371,3837666,"an average shooter firingin poor conditions, never missed.","Jack Reacher"
"807",3837833,3839001,"He did miss.","Jack Reacher"
"808",3839376,3840585,"He did.","Jack Reacher"
"809",3843715,3844923,"A pristine bullet,","Jack Reacher"
"810",3845884,3848344,"conveniently trappedby a liquid backstop.","Jack Reacher"
"811",3850347,3852889,"The same bullet that tiedBarr's gun to the killings.","Jack Reacher"
"812",3853516,3856893,"And arguably the prosecution's singlemost important piece of evidence.","Jack Reacher"
"813",3857394,3860563,"If Barr wanted to get caught,he didn't miss.","Jack Reacher"
"814",3861190,3862525,"Either way, it doesn't make sense.","Jack Reacher"
"815",3862733,3865068,"If he wanted to get away with it,he likely would have","Jack Reacher"
"816",3865195,3866862,"and if he wanted to get caught,","Jack Reacher"
"817",3867197,3869782,"Barr was incapable of such perfection.","Jack Reacher"
"818",3869907,3871742,"Or maybe he just got lucky,six shots out of six.","Jack Reacher"
"819",3872034,3874077,"That's what I was willing to accept,","Jack Reacher"
"820",3874204,3876121,"then those guys took a run at me.","Jack Reacher"
"821",3876581,3878706,"Whoever sent them made a mistake.","Jack Reacher"
"822",3878916,3881251,"It was just a bar fight.","Jack Reacher"
"823",3881545,3882710,"Maybe.","Jack Reacher"
"824",3883755,3886590,"Or maybe someone got nervous,tried to run me off.","Jack Reacher"
"825",3887092,3891387,"Or put me in a coma,right next to their patsy.","Jack Reacher"
"826",3894266,3895766,"Patsy?","Jack Reacher"
"827",3897101,3899728,"It was such a great crime scene.","Jack Reacher"
"828",3899813,3901771,"No one stopped to thinkit might be too great.","Jack Reacher"
"829",3902231,3903440,"Not Emerson.","Jack Reacher"
"830",3903608,3905233,"Not your father.","Jack Reacher"
"831",3905610,3907945,"Not even Barr's own defence attorney.","Jack Reacher"
"832",3909614,3911282,"But Barr knew I would,","Jack Reacher"
"833",3912951,3915619,"no matter how muchI wanted it to be true.","Jack Reacher"
"834",3917581,3919331,"That's why he asked for me.","Jack Reacher"
"835",3920250,3921291,"Wait.","Jack Reacher"
"836",3922460,3923668,"Are you suggesting...","Jack Reacher"
"837",3923795,3925963,"James Barr is innocent.","Jack Reacher"
"838",3935306,3937141,"You can see what this is, can't you?","Jack Reacher"
"839",3938143,3939601,"You've got a case in your hands","Jack Reacher"
"840",3939686,3941811,"that may bethe last case you'll ever have","Jack Reacher"
"841",3942981,3945773,"and you'll do anythingnot to hit the bottom of it.","Jack Reacher"
"842",3947485,3948610,"Helen.","Jack Reacher"
"843",3949612,3951487,"You know,you never should have retired.","Jack Reacher"
"844",3951655,3953157,"Just, look. Listen.","Jack Reacher"
"845",3953324,3954742,"For all I know, you werestanding at an intersection","Jack Reacher"
"846",3954826,3956034,"with a cardboard sign three days ago.","Jack Reacher"
"847",3956327,3958661,"And I hired you.Jesus, my father was right.","Jack Reacher"
"848",3959164,3961831,"- Helen. Helen.- It makes total sense now.","Jack Reacher"
"849",3961958,3963708,"It's the way you live,the way you move around.","Jack Reacher"
"850",3963835,3966503,"You're just not cut outfor the real world, are you?","Jack Reacher"
"851",3966795,3968047,"Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?","Jack Reacher"
"852",3968172,3969340,"- Helen.- Is that what this is?","Jack Reacher"
"853",3969465,3970507,"Look out the window.","Jack Reacher"
"854",3970675,3971967,"No, I have work to do.","Jack Reacher"
"855",3972052,3973344,"- And you need to leave.- Just humour me. Okay.","Jack Reacher"
"856",3973844,3974887,"Let go of me.","Jack Reacher"
"857",3976514,3978514,"- Would you tell me what you see?- I see the same","Jack Reacher"
"858",3979851,3982143,"things I see every day.","Jack Reacher"
"859",3982353,3984355,"Well, imagine you've never seen it.","Jack Reacher"
"860",3985856,3988858,"Imagine you've spent your whole lifein other parts of the world","Jack Reacher"
"861",3989193,3991695,"being told every dayyou're defending freedom.","Jack Reacher"
"862",3991987,3994155,"And finallyyou decide you've had enough.","Jack Reacher"
"863",3995032,3998242,"Time to seewhat you've given up your whole life for.","Jack Reacher"
"864",3998494,4000996,"Maybe get some of that freedomfor yourself.","Jack Reacher"
"865",4002706,4004166,"Look at the people.","Jack Reacher"
"866",4005710,4007710,"Now tell me which ones are free.","Jack Reacher"
"867",4009338,4011005,"Free from debt.","Jack Reacher"
"868",4011382,4012632,"Anxiety.","Jack Reacher"
"869",4012717,4013967,"Stress.","Jack Reacher"
"870",4014052,4015302,"Fear.","Jack Reacher"
"871",4015387,4019056,"Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.","Jack Reacher"
"872",4021559,4024561,"How many wish they were bornknowing what they know now?","Jack Reacher"
"873",4024688,4026813,"Ask yourself how many would do things","Jack Reacher"
"874",4026898,4028565,"the same way all over again?","Jack Reacher"
"875",4029693,4032068,"And how many wouldlive their lives like me?","Jack Reacher"
"876",4035407,4038199,"Now look at the silver Audiacross the street,","Jack Reacher"
"877",4038284,4040244,"the one that's been following me all day.","Jack Reacher"
"878",4040577,4041911,"What does that prove?","Jack Reacher"
"879",4042038,4045416,"Here's the tag number.How long would it take you to run it?","Jack Reacher"

"895",4098927,4100679,"Yeah, conspiracy to killfive random people?","Jack Reacher"
"896",4100805,4102055,"There's no motive.","Jack Reacher"
"897",4102140,4104475,"- It's ridiculous, right?- It's grassy knoll ludicrous.","Jack Reacher"
"898",4104641,4106435,"No point looking any further.","Jack Reacher"
"899",4106603,4109645,"Exactly.","Jack Reacher"
"900",4113150,4114609,"What's this?","Jack Reacher"
"901",4114778,4116819,"The motive. Just hold onto it.","Jack Reacher"
"902",4116945,4118154,"What are we playing, Clue?","Jack Reacher"

"911",4181261,4182594,"Four.","Jack Reacher"
"912",4184096,4185930,"Four random people.","Jack Reacher"
"913",4187432,4189560,"To hide one specific target.","Jack Reacher"
"914",4213710,4217212,"Someone neededOline Archer's construction business.","Jack Reacher"
"915",4219882,4222301,"And Oline wouldn't let it go.","Jack Reacher"
"916",4232561,4234813,"It's a convincing theory.","Jack Reacher"
"917",4237649,4239484,"But it's just a theory.","Jack Reacher"
"918",4240819,4245323,"The first round is the least accurate.The snipers call it a cold shot.","Jack Reacher"
"919",4245574,4247658,"Meanwhile, your eyewitnessdescribed a pause","Jack Reacher"
"920",4247827,4250078,"between the first and second rounds.","Jack Reacher"
"921",4250662,4253081,"The one shot where the killertook his time.","Jack Reacher"
"922",4253332,4255917,"And Oline Archerwas the second victim.","Jack Reacher"
"923",4256168,4258837,"The one shot that mattered.","Jack Reacher"
"924",4260672,4262298,"But it's just a theory.","Jack Reacher"
"925",4263676,4265426,"This frame was custom made for Barr.","Jack Reacher"
"926",4266345,4268180,"Whoever chose himknew about Baghdad","Jack Reacher"
"927",4268305,4269931,"and the only one who could havetold him about Baghdad","Jack Reacher"
"928",4270015,4271600,"was Barr himself.","Jack Reacher"
"929",4271684,4275186,"He has at least one friend.A very close one.","Jack Reacher"
"930",4275520,4277855,"Now, you find that friend,you'll find the real shooter.","Jack Reacher"
"931",4278106,4279608,"Find the real shooter? Reacher,","Jack Reacher"
"932",4279692,4282527,"my job is to present the jurywith reasonable doubt. Period.","Jack Reacher"

"937",4293038,4296707,"I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.","Jack Reacher"
"938",4299878,4301880,"And frankly, neither are you.","Jack Reacher"
"939",4305717,4307719,"I can't do this any more.","Jack Reacher"
"940",4312557,4314393,"Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.","Jack Reacher"

"972",4501413,4504166,"If I'm right,someone killed four random people","Jack Reacher"
"973",4504250,4506417,"so no one would look directly at Oline.","Jack Reacher"
"974",4506836,4510337,"And if I'm right, just saying her namecould get you killed.","Jack Reacher"
"975",4510422,4513175,"- You saying I should be scared?- Well, are you smart?","Jack Reacher"
"976",4513676,4514717,"Obviously.","Jack Reacher"

"1102",5551212,5553838,"I saw a man by that nameshoot for the Wimbledon Cup,","Jack Reacher"
"1103",5553965,5555548,"what, ten years ago.","Jack Reacher"
"1104",5556051,5559011,"And I'm pretty sure you neverplayed second base for the Yankees","Jack Reacher"
"1105",5559554,5561221,"in 1925.","Jack Reacher"
"1106",5562556,5563724,"Now,","Jack Reacher"
"1107",5564725,5566226,"I'll answer one question.","Jack Reacher"
"1108",5567311,5568645,"Who's your best shooter?","Jack Reacher"
"1109",5570148,5571398,"James Barr.","Jack Reacher"
"1110",5574903,5577654,"I pulled all these downas soon as I heard about the shooting.","Jack Reacher"

"1112",5584746,5586913,"I ever seen this side of civilian life.","Jack Reacher"
"1113",5587916,5592336,"Suppose I told you Barr wasn't thisgood on his best day in the Army.","Jack Reacher"
"1114",5592420,5595506,"I handed out those targets myself.That's my scrawl on every one.","Jack Reacher"

"1116",5597926,5599592,"What, are you serious?","Jack Reacher"
"1117",5600261,5603096,"I'm sayingit's possible that Barr had a friend.","Jack Reacher"
"1118",5603515,5605099,"One who switched the targetson the range.","Jack Reacher"
"1119",5605182,5606516,"Maybe Barr let him.","Jack Reacher"
"1120",5606768,5609936,"Made him feel like King Shithaving his name up on your wall.","Jack Reacher"
"1121",5610020,5614440,"I never saw one real shooterwho would do that for his own mother.","Jack Reacher"
"1122",5615944,5618945,"Unless he was framing his motherfor multiple murder","Jack Reacher"
"1123",5620282,5622115,"and using your range to do it.","Jack Reacher"
"1124",5625453,5627578,"Barr didn't come alone, did he?","Jack Reacher"
"1125",5629416,5632751,"You know, one of these nuts is likelyto kill you, they find that camera, there.","Jack Reacher"

"1138",5668829,5670331,"Just give me three hours to get back.","Jack Reacher"

"1140",5672625,5674460,"I'll look into that, thanks.","Jack Reacher"
"1141",5675837,5678171,"This is justwhat I could pull this morning.","Jack Reacher"

"1143",5682510,5684219,"Shell corporation in Georgia.","Jack Reacher"
"1144",5684304,5686680,"That's the one next to Russia,not Florida.","Jack Reacher"
"1145",5687474,5691185,"They work one city at a time,acquiring a local construction concern","Jack Reacher"
"1146",5691478,5693311,"just ahead of major civic redevelopment.","Jack Reacher"
"1147",5693520,5697190,"They build bridges no one needs.Highways no one uses.","Jack Reacher"

"1149",5703698,5707201,"They moved 12 times in 15 years.Atlanta, Albuquerque,","Jack Reacher"

"1152",5713500,5716960,"including millions of dollarsin missing public funds.","Jack Reacher"
"1153",5717045,5721381,"And yet never an investigation.Never even an inquiry.","Jack Reacher"
"1154",5721882,5725551,"It's as if Lebendauer Enterpriseswere above reproach.","Jack Reacher"
"1155",5729515,5732141,"Well, maybe that's because","Jack Reacher"
"1156",5733645,5736020,"the allegations comefrom the competition.","Jack Reacher"
"1157",5737399,5739024,"Outbid. Bitter.","Jack Reacher"
"1158",5739567,5741068,"Like Oline Archer.","Jack Reacher"
"1159",5741569,5744988,"Or maybe Lebendauerhas the cooperation of key officials.","Jack Reacher"
"1160",5745073,5748033,"And maybewhen that cooperation isn't enough,","Jack Reacher"
"1161",5748409,5751662,"they kill people who won't be bought off.Like Oline Archer.","Jack Reacher"
"1162",5751746,5753913,"Helen, how much of thisdo you honestly believe?","Jack Reacher"
"1163",5754039,5756207,"It doesn't matter how much I believe.","Jack Reacher"
"1164",5756917,5758836,"It doesn't even matterhow much I can prove.","Jack Reacher"
"1165",5758920,5761421,"It only matters how much is true.","Jack Reacher"
"1166",5761713,5763715,"Do you know how delusional you sound?","Jack Reacher"
"1167",5764216,5765884,"What happened to you?","Jack Reacher"
"1168",5766261,5770430,"Are you really so set on puttingthis man to death that you'd ignore...","Jack Reacher"
"1169",5781775,5784944,"I pulled all of this paperunder my own name.","Jack Reacher"
"1170",5785947,5787780,"If Jack Reacher's right,","Jack Reacher"
"1171",5788283,5791618,"my life, your daughter's life,","Jack Reacher"

"1177",5809470,5813306,"Your next movewill tell me which side you're on.","Jack Reacher"
"1178",5816144,5817603,"I see. It's a test.","Jack Reacher"
"1179",5818770,5823649,"Well, this may be hard for youto believe, but I do love you.","Jack Reacher"
"1180",5825653,5828154,"And obviously I'm notgoing to turn a blind eye,","Jack Reacher"
"1181",5828280,5830657,"no matter how absurd I find all of this.","Jack Reacher"
"1182",5831993,5835621,"So, if you really believethat you're in danger,","Jack Reacher"
"1183",5835997,5837497,"if you believe that,","Jack Reacher"
"1184",5838832,5840958,"then the next order of business,","Jack Reacher"
"1185",5842002,5845171,"is to put youin protective custody right now.","Jack Reacher"
"1186",5848342,5850260,"And how safe will I beif you're part of it?","Jack Reacher"
"1187",5850677,5852304,"Jesus, Helen.","Jack Reacher"

"1269",6325110,6326360,"Enough?","Jack Reacher"
"1270",6326612,6328445,"There is no such thing.","Jack Reacher"
"1271",6328780,6330782,"We take what can be taken.","Jack Reacher"

"1282",6366652,6368987,"You should never have involved him.","Jack Reacher"
"1283",6369320,6372990,"Now you will have to convince himto forget, for your sake","Jack Reacher"

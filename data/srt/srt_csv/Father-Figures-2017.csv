"2153",5796498,5798877,"Oh, my God. This just got really sad.","Father Figures"
"2154",5799042,5800716,"So, with no family on record,","Father Figures"
"2155",5800877,5803381,"the hospital was requiredto call social services.","Father Figures"
"2156",5803547,5807769,"But Helen didn't want to put youinto that system and maybe get split up.","Father Figures"
"2157",5807926,5811556,"She loved you from the moment she saw you.","Father Figures"
"2158",5812974,5815351,"So, I started the process of adoption.","Father Figures"
"2159",5816144,5818020,"Despite my objections.","Father Figures"
"2160",5818186,5819859,"See, much as I loved Helen...","Father Figures"
"2161",5820023,5824529,"I couldn't imagine sacrificing my futurefor two tiny strangers. You know?","Father Figures"

"2163",5828698,5830951,"I'm better with animals, I guess.","Father Figures"
"2164",5831117,5835542,"Helen, on the other hand,could imagine nothing else.","Father Figures"
"2165",5835787,5840840,"And I brought you hereto Westerville to raise you.","Father Figures"

"2182",5944188,5946987,"Biological mother dies at child birth?","Father Figures"
"2183",5947149,5949118,"Which I guess is another wayof saying we killed her.","Father Figures"
"2184",5949277,5950278,"No.","Father Figures"
"2185",5950360,5952078,"At a certain point,I just gotta say, you're right.","Father Figures"

"2194",5985896,5988775,"Where would we be right now without Mom?","Father Figures"
"2195",5988940,5991989,"And I hate to even contemplate this.","Father Figures"
"2196",5992444,5995573,"We might be running around out there,","Father Figures"
"2197",5997283,6001913,"not even aware that each other exists.","Father Figures"

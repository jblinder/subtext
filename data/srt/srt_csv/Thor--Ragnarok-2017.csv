"39",184665,186246,"I'm really sorry.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"40",187252,188882,"Okay, so let me get this straight.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"41",189044,192675,"You're going to put your crowninto the Eternal Flame","Thor: Ragnarok"

"50",215697,216866,"It's a crown.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"56",241223,244812,"All will suffer, all will burn.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"57",244975,246686,"That's intense.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"59",248855,251355,"and set fire to a planetwould be quite the spectacle.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"70",291399,294069,"Everything seems to work out.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"71",372896,376606,"Heimdall, I know it's been a while,but I could really use a fast exit.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"72",378112,379531,"Heimdall?","Thor: Ragnarok"
"73",380531,382411,"Heimdall was an idiot.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"74",382574,384533,"This job should have made him rich.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"100",557332,558582,"Traitor?","Thor: Ragnarok"
"101",558751,561341,"Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdallwith negligence of duty","Thor: Ragnarok"
"102",561504,563423,"but he disappeared before the trial.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"103",563590,565909,"Hard to catch a guy who can seeeverything in the universe.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1206",5176988,5178448,"I don't mean to impose...","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1207",5181702,5183412,"But the Grandmasterhas a great many ships.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1211",5191295,5192939,"I've run out of favorwith the Grandmaster,","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1221",5213775,5215605,"Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1222",5215778,5217377,"There was one timewhen we were children,","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1224",5220448,5222288,"So, I went to pick up the snaketo admire it,","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1225",5222451,5225212,"and he transformed back into himselfand he was like, ""Yeah, it's me!""","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1226",5225328,5228338,"And he stabbed me.We were eight at the time.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1246",5278923,5280423,"Don't know.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1247",5280592,5283762,"But the arena's mainframe for theObedience Disks have been deactivated","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1262",5327849,5329479,"Odin brought us together.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1263",5330268,5333108,"It's almost poetic that his deathshould split us apart.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1270",5357462,5358881,"Did you just agree with me?","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1271",5359046,5360627,"Come on, this place is perfect for you.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1278",5377399,5379859,"I don't know,maybe there's still good in you.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1279",5380025,5383525,"But let's be honest,our paths diverged a long time ago.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1280",5388201,5389251,"Yeah.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1281",5390412,5392851,"It's probably for the bestthat we never see each other again.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1297",5422944,5425064,"Now, which one's the shipshe told us to get?","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1298",5425238,5426238,"The Commodore.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1299",5426908,5427908,"Right.","Thor: Ragnarok"

"1302",5438418,5439896,"I know I've betrayed you many timesbefore,","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1303",5439921,5441591,"but this timeit's truly nothing personal.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1304",5441756,5444836,"The reward for your capturewill set me up nicely.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1305",5445009,5446639,"Never one for sentiment, were you?","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1306",5446802,5448262,"Easier to let it burn.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1307",5448595,5449595,"I agree.","Thor: Ragnarok"
"1308",5458064,5459694,"That looks painful.","Thor: Ragnarok"

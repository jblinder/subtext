"802",3378123,3382001,"Painless is a dentist, and a dentistshouldn't read. That's his whole problem.","MASH"
"803",3382086,3384838,"His problem is that he believes it.l mean, he really is convinced.","MASH"
"804",3384922,3388842,"lt's an obsession, and it's a vital force.","MASH"
"805",3390219,3391719,"Here he comes! The jawbreaker.","MASH"

"819",3445483,3448943,"Well, that's another thingl wanted to ask you.","MASH"
"820",3449487,3451572,"l'm sort of new at this game, and...","MASH"
"821",3451655,3454490,"Do you have any particular methodthat you'd recommend?","MASH"
"822",3454576,3458619,"l don't know. l think my colleagues and lcould come up with something","MASH"

"824",3461916,3465043,"- Black capsule.- Of course. That's neat.","MASH"
"825",3465128,3468088,"What's a black capsule?Do you have any of them? Does it work?","MASH"
"826",3468172,3469797,"lt worked for Hitler and Eva Braun.","MASH"
"827",3469882,3471425,"- lt should work for you.- lt's simple and it's effective.","MASH"
"828",3472552,3473969,"Hawkeye, l really must...","MASH"
"829",3474052,3476554,"l should check withthe military vicar's office.","MASH"
"830",3476639,3480976,"You see, l cannot give absolution to a manwho is about to commit suicide.","MASH"
"831",3481059,3482226,"lt's a mortal sin.","MASH"
"832",3482311,3486023,"Look, Dago, he is not committing suicide.He is only intending to commit suicide.","MASH"
"833",3486106,3488858,"So you're not dealing with an act,you're dealing with an intention.","MASH"
"834",3488943,3492320,"And if it works, if what we're doing works,then he will not commit suicide,","MASH"
"835",3492405,3494655,"so thereforeyou're preventing a mortal sin. Okay?","MASH"
"836",3494740,3496657,"Well, l should check.","MASH"
"837",3496742,3499452,"- Well, you check on it.- Well, there's...","MASH"

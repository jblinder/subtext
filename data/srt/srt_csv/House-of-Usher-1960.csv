"75",543376,546880,"Mr Winthrop, are you actuallyplanning to marry my sister?","House of Usher"
"76",548214,549807,"Mr Usher,","House of Usher"
"77",550592,554062,"during the time we spent together inBoston, it never occurred to me that...","House of Usher"

"88",590381,592930,"Why shouldn't Madeline marryand have children?","House of Usher"

"91",601684,603937,"We are dying, Mr Winthrop.","House of Usher"

"95",620495,624216,"But under the circumstancesit is quite impossible.","House of Usher"
"96",625208,628712,"But why do you assume that...that you are dying?","House of Usher"
"97",629796,631890,"There are many reasons.","House of Usher"
"98",632006,634134,"Pray give me one, then.","House of Usher"
"99",638138,641062,"Madeline and Iare like figures of fine glass.","House of Usher"
"100",642183,644732,"The slightest touchand we may shatter.","House of Usher"
"101",646271,649992,"Both of us suffer froma morbid acuteness of the senses.","House of Usher"
"102",651401,653654,"Mine is the worsefor having existed the longer,","House of Usher"
"103",653778,656122,"but both of us areafflicted with it.","House of Usher"
"104",656739,660664,"Any sort of food more exoticthan the most pallid mash","House of Usher"
"105",660785,664289,"is unendurable to my taste buds.","House of Usher"
"106",664414,668965,"Any sort of garment other thanthe softest is agony to my flesh.","House of Usher"
"107",670253,674258,"My eyes are tormented byall but the faintest illumination.","House of Usher"
"108",675425,678019,"Odours assail me constantly.","House of Usher"
"109",679012,683643,"And, as I've said,sounds of any degree whatsoever","House of Usher"
"110",683766,685518,"inspire me with terror.","House of Usher"
"111",685643,687987,"That's why your servant askedme to remove my boots.","House of Usher"
"112",688521,690148,"Yes.","House of Usher"
"113",690273,692867,"And even so,I could hear your coming.","House of Usher"
"114",692984,696204,"Every footstep,every rustle of your clothes.","House of Usher"
"115",696321,698915,"I could hear yourhorse approaching,","House of Usher"
"116",699032,703788,"hear the clatter of its hoovesacross the courtyard, your knock...","House of Usher"
"117",703912,707917,"The grating of the door boltwas like a sword stroke to my ears.","House of Usher"
"118",711085,715215,"I can hear the scratch of ratclaws within the stone wall.","House of Usher"
"119",716966,723190,"Mr Winthrop, three-quarters ofmy family have fallen into madness,","House of Usher"
"120",723306,727903,"and in their madness haveacquired a superhuman strength,","House of Usher"
"121",728811,732111,"so that it took the powerof many to subdue them.","House of Usher"
"122",732232,734030,"Do you not exaggerate, sir?","House of Usher"
"123",737612,741082,"Perhaps there have beenin your family certain...","House of Usher"

"160",1033824,1035701,"For Madeline's safety.","House of Usher"
"161",1039247,1043377,"It was probably the trembling of the housewhich caused that chandelier to fall.","House of Usher"

"163",1048798,1050516,"Have you a better explanation?","House of Usher"

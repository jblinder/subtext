"1046",4138630,4140560,"The thing that really shook them...","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1047",4140630,4143600,"was that I wanted to marry anybodythey hadn't even heard about.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1048",4143660,4146630,"I can't blame themfor being sort of stunned by it all.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"

"1050",4151670,4154440,"I mean, I wouldn't appear unreasonableif I suggested...","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1051",4154510,4158670,"that the two of you were behaving likea couple of escaped lunatics, would I?","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1052",4161050,4163020,"This whole thing...","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1053",4163080,4165080,"happened so quickly...","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1054",4165150,4167090,"it's like trying to ride a rocket.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1055",4167160,4170180,"We didn't plan it that way.It just happened that way.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1056",4170260,4174250,"It's a little hard on Joanna's folks andI'm sure it's gonna be hard on you.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1057",4175760,4177530,"We've got one eveningto discuss it...","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1058",4177600,4180620,"and if you have any objections,you'd better raise them in a hurry...","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1059",4180700,4184030,"because in exactly four hourswe're gonna be on that plane and gone.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1060",4184110,4187630,"I don't think I could listall my objections in four hours.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"
"1061",4187710,4190010,"I think I'd needmore like eight hours.","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"

"185",1160623,1164157,"He seems to think it was a good idea.If there's one thing we know...","Mildred Pierce"
"186",1164336,1170125,"...it's that an innocent man alwaysdenies the crime, loud and often.","Mildred Pierce"
"187",1170299,1172423,"Pierce doesn't.","Mildred Pierce"
"188",1172594,1176009,"So do you blame us for feelingfairly confident that he's the man...","Mildred Pierce"

"191",1181769,1184439,"Okay. He's kind and gentle.He's wonderful.","Mildred Pierce"
"192",1184605,1188354,"But if he's so wonderful, Mrs. Beragon,why did you divorce him?","Mildred Pierce"
"193",1193573,1195778,"Because I was wrong.","Mildred Pierce"
"194",1195950,1200363,"It's taken me four years to findthat out, but now I know I was wrong.","Mildred Pierce"

"907",3929646,3931722,"This calls for a drink.","Mildred Pierce"
"908",3931898,3935266,"In the Beragon family,there is an old Spanish proverb:","Mildred Pierce"
"909",3935443,3938016,"One man's poisonis another man's meat.","Mildred Pierce"
"910",3939405,3940485,"Bert!","Mildred Pierce"
"911",3954253,3957586,"I was in love with him, and I knew itfor the first time that night...","Mildred Pierce"

"913",3961844,3965628,"That may be. Whoever killed himevidently agreed with you.","Mildred Pierce"
"914",3965806,3969851,"But you haven't given us one reason whyyour first husband wasn't the murderer.","Mildred Pierce"
"915",3970018,3972853,"In fact, you've given usa very good reason why he was.","Mildred Pierce"
"916",3973021,3977067,"Look at it our way. One, Beragonwas killed with Pierce's gun.","Mildred Pierce"
"917",3977235,3981148,"Two, Pierce cannot account forhis movements at the time of the murder.","Mildred Pierce"
"918",3981322,3987739,"Three, he had a motive. You've justgiven it to us, Mrs. Beragon. Jealousy.","Mildred Pierce"
"919",3987911,3990367,"This just came in.Thought you'd want it.","Mildred Pierce"
"920",3990539,3993659,"- Will you excuse me?- Certainly.","Mildred Pierce"
"921",3996378,4000708,"- Is he sure?- Charley don't like to make mistakes.","Mildred Pierce"
"922",4000884,4002876,"Just a minute.","Mildred Pierce"
"923",4003052,4007264,"Mrs. Beragon, we have someinformation here which puzzles us a little.","Mildred Pierce"
"924",4007806,4011675,"For instance, your business manager....","Mildred Pierce"
"925",4011853,4014853,"- Right away.- Okay.","Mildred Pierce"
"926",4015023,4019815,"Ida Corwin. She tells us that youcalled her at approximately 11:45 p. m...","Mildred Pierce"
"927",4019985,4022228,"...and asked her where Mr. Beragon was.","Mildred Pierce"
"928",4022405,4026947,"- You seemed quite upset at the time.- It was just a business matter.","Mildred Pierce"
"929",4027117,4030568,"- Then there was nothing wrong?- No.","Mildred Pierce"
"930",4030746,4034411,"Occasionally we run acrossa witness who refuses to tell us...","Mildred Pierce"
"931",4034583,4039958,"...what we want to know, except underpressure. Like Wally Fay, for example.","Mildred Pierce"
"932",4040130,4044460,"Why did you take him to the beach house?Did you know Beragon was there, dead?","Mildred Pierce"
"933",4044635,4047672,"- No, I didn't.- Then you were at the beach house.","Mildred Pierce"
"934",4047847,4051596,"Why didn't you tell us that before?Why did you run from the house?","Mildred Pierce"
"935",4051768,4054637,"Wasn't it because youknew Beragon was there, dead?","Mildred Pierce"
"936",4054811,4059639,"And if you did know, why were youtrying to pin the murder onto Fay? Why?","Mildred Pierce"
"937",4060193,4063360,"I think you'd bettertell us the truth now.","Mildred Pierce"
"938",4066114,4067610,"I did it.","Mildred Pierce"
"939",4067784,4068945,"I killed him.","Mildred Pierce"
"940",4069117,4074742,"But why? Your restaurant was a success.You were in love with Beragon.","Mildred Pierce"
"941",4075458,4078577,"What happened to all that?","Mildred Pierce"
"942",4078753,4083628,"The restaurant was a greater successthan I knew. Profits were enormous.","Mildred Pierce"
"943",4083800,4087298,"In a few months I opened another place,and then I started a chain.","Mildred Pierce"
"944",4087469,4089878,"In three years I built five restaurants.","Mildred Pierce"
"945",4090056,4093639,"Everywhere you went,I had a restaurant. They made money.","Mildred Pierce"
"946",4093809,4098970,"Everything I touched turned into money,and I needed it. I needed it for Veda.","Mildred Pierce"
"947",4103403,4106902,"She was becoming a young ladywith expensive tastes.","Mildred Pierce"
"948",4107239,4109992,"Veda was growing up.","Mildred Pierce"
"949",4128136,4131469,"That Ted Forrester is nice-looking.Veda likes him.","Mildred Pierce"
"950",4131639,4133845,"Who wouldn't?He has a million dollars.","Mildred Pierce"
"951",4134016,4138014,"- What's the matter?- Nothing. I've just run out of jokes.","Mildred Pierce"
"952",4138186,4141520,"- What is it? Tell me.- I've had a little bad luck lately.","Mildred Pierce"
"953",4141690,4145355,"I won't be able to affordmany more evenings like this.","Mildred Pierce"
"954",4145528,4149442,"- Do you need money?- No, no. It isn't anything like that.","Mildred Pierce"
"955",4149615,4154076,"- I think you do.- Mildred, please don't do that.","Mildred Pierce"
"956",4154244,4157993,"You've been awfully good to us, Monte.Take it, please.","Mildred Pierce"
"957",4158166,4163503,"If you say so. But I'll pay it back.I want it understood that it's only a loan.","Mildred Pierce"
"958",4163671,4167538,"Anything you say,just as long as we're friends.","Mildred Pierce"
"959",4171054,4175762,"That's how it began. At first itbothered Monte to take money from me.","Mildred Pierce"
"960",4175934,4179100,"Then it became a habit with him.","Mildred Pierce"
"961",4179354,4182686,"There's a total hereof $ 1480.29 in six months.","Mildred Pierce"
"962",4182856,4184814,"- What's the big idea?- We owe him a great deal.","Mildred Pierce"
"963",4184984,4187654,"The restaurant's paid for.You don't owe him a cent.","Mildred Pierce"
"964",4187819,4190655,"I manage this business,and I've done all right.","Mildred Pierce"
"965",4190823,4193694,"Keeping Beragon in shirtsis not my idea of business.","Mildred Pierce"
"966",4193868,4195030,"- No?- No!","Mildred Pierce"
"967",4195203,4197954,"Look, I made this business for youwith my own hands.","Mildred Pierce"
"968",4198122,4200411,"I got banks to give you credit.That wasn't easy.","Mildred Pierce"
"969",4200582,4204414,"I conned everybody, and for what? So youcould have a lap dog named Beragon?","Mildred Pierce"
"970",4204587,4206876,"- Take it easy, Wally.- When you walked out on Bert...","Mildred Pierce"
"971",4207047,4208791,"...I was glad to see you get some sense.","Mildred Pierce"
"972",4208966,4212170,"- Beragon's worse.- That's none of your business.","Mildred Pierce"
"973",4212345,4218715,"It is. I helped you so I'd be around whenyour mind changed. Maybe I was wrong.","Mildred Pierce"
"974",4218893,4222807,"- Maybe you were.- Beragon is no good. He'll bleed you dry.","Mildred Pierce"
"975",4223398,4226185,"Suppose I'm in love with him.","Mildred Pierce"
"976",4229237,4230944,"Huh.","Mildred Pierce"
"977",4231113,4232904,"Okay.","Mildred Pierce"

"984",4258474,4262720,"- I told him I was in love with Beragon.- Are you?","Mildred Pierce"
"985",4262895,4265895,"I thought I was once, but not now.","Mildred Pierce"
"986",4266274,4267601,"Good.","Mildred Pierce"

"990",4283207,4286908,"Here, you have to sign this in blood.","Mildred Pierce"

"994",4296345,4298503,"Hasn't she paid them back?","Mildred Pierce"

"1334",5616291,5619292,"You don't really want to buythis antiquated tomb.","Mildred Pierce"
"1335",5619460,5621369,"You'd be out of your mind.","Mildred Pierce"
"1336",5621546,5626006,"I don't know. It isn't such a badhouse. Remodeling would do wonders.","Mildred Pierce"
"1337",5626676,5630507,"Take off some of that gingerbreadand redecorate the inside and-","Mildred Pierce"
"1338",5632097,5634671,"My businesslike airisn't fooling you much, is it?","Mildred Pierce"
"1339",5635184,5640559,"No, I remember too well. I rememberhow it was with us once, and so do you.","Mildred Pierce"

"1344",5656038,5657829,"Why?","Mildred Pierce"
"1345",5658332,5661951,"I must say, your attitude isn'texactly enthusiastic.","Mildred Pierce"
"1346",5662127,5664998,"You went to considerable troubleto get rid of me once so naturally...","Mildred Pierce"
"1347",5665172,5670511,"...I'm startled by your proposalof marriage. This is a little sudden.","Mildred Pierce"

"1349",5673640,5675927,"- A reason named Veda.- Why should it be?","Mildred Pierce"
"1350",5676100,5680050,"Because your reason for doing anythingis usually Veda.","Mildred Pierce"
"1351",5680229,5684606,"Well, whether it is or isn't,what's your answer?","Mildred Pierce"
"1352",5684775,5688226,"I can't afford you.You have money, and I haven't.","Mildred Pierce"
"1353",5688404,5692235,"All I have is pride and a name,and I can't sell either.","Mildred Pierce"

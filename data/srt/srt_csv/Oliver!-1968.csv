"1012",6772307,6773683,"and a thief,","Oliver!"
"1013",6774017,6775935,"and all that's bad.","Oliver!"
"1014",6776019,6778521,"Ain't that enough for youwithout beating him to death?","Oliver!"
"1015",6778647,6784694,"Come, come, Sikes.We must have civil words. Civil words.","Oliver!"

"1017",6788031,6790950,"I thieved for you when I was half his age.","Oliver!"
"1018",6791034,6793703,"And it's your dirty workI've been doing ever since.","Oliver!"
"1019",6793787,6798040,"-Well, if you have, it's a living, isn't it?-He's right, Nancy. A living is a living.","Oliver!"
"1020",6798167,6800501,"Some living! Lord help me!","Oliver!"
"1021",6800794,6802211,"Some living!","Oliver!"
"1022",6803046,6805047,"Get to bed, all of you.","Oliver!"
"1023",6806216,6808801,"Get to bed, I said!","Oliver!"
"1024",6809303,6812680,"All this violence, all these scenes,screams, dramas!","Oliver!"
"1025",6813223,6816058,"I'm asking you, is it necessary?","Oliver!"
"1026",6817853,6819395,"Not yet, Fagin.","Oliver!"
"1027",6820230,6821564,"Not yet.","Oliver!"
"1028",6822232,6826652,"But if this godforsaken littlegood-for-nothing's uttered one word,","Oliver!"
"1029",6826737,6828321,"one word, mind you...","Oliver!"
"1030",6828405,6830990,"If he has, the little devil,","Oliver!"
"1031",6831074,6833576,"we sit down, we talk it over, we think it out,","Oliver!"
"1032",6833660,6835912,"we decide upon a proper courseof safe action,","Oliver!"
"1033",6836038,6837830,"we stay calm!","Oliver!"
"1034",6839416,6842752,"Do we? And while we're sitting here","Oliver!"
"1035",6843253,6848925,"thinking, and talking, and staying calm,our collars get felt, don't they?","Oliver!"
"1036",6849718,6852428,"And it's,""Come along with me, if you please.""","Oliver!"
"1037",6853514,6855389,"No, thank you very much.","Oliver!"
"1038",6855682,6860603,"Look, you thought us into this little lot.You can think your way out of it.","Oliver!"
"1039",6861730,6865942,"But from now on, Bill Sikestakes the law into his own hands.","Oliver!"
"1040",6867069,6868611,"These hands.","Oliver!"
"1041",6870239,6875952,"Have you ever heard the sound a chickenmakes when they're wringing off its neck?","Oliver!"
"1042",6878455,6880706,"Can't say I ever had the...","Oliver!"
"1043",6880791,6882625,"They squawks, Fagin.","Oliver!"
"1044",6883794,6885419,"They squawks.","Oliver!"
"1045",6886255,6888130,"Not a very pretty sound.","Oliver!"
"1046",6889216,6890383,"No, Bill.","Oliver!"
"1047",6890467,6893803,"And then they dies, don't they?","Oliver!"
"1048",6895097,6897557,"Yes, Bill. I mean, no, Bill.","Oliver!"
"1049",6898100,6903104,"Then they say some even start squawkingbefore that event.","Oliver!"
"1050",6903230,6907316,"They get what you might calla premonition.","Oliver!"
"1051",6908318,6909652,"Now, then,","Oliver!"
"1052",6910279,6914991,"you wouldn't be having no premonitionof that sort by any chance, would you?","Oliver!"
"1053",6915909,6919120,"Not me, Bill. The lips are sealed.","Oliver!"
"1054",6920247,6921581,"I'm glad.","Oliver!"
"1055",6922165,6926168,"Because if anyone hereshould lead the law to me,","Oliver!"
"1056",6926295,6928754,"and I gets to hear of it,","Oliver!"
"1057",6928839,6931591,"then it will be your neck.","Oliver!"
"1058",6931675,6936178,"Your scraggy old neck.","Oliver!"
"1059",6944313,6946480,"You think about it, Fagin.","Oliver!"
"1060",6975010,6978721,"A violent man, Dodger. A very violent man.","Oliver!"
"1061",6980057,6983851,"When that man's back is up, Dodger,no one is safe.","Oliver!"
"1062",7017761,7019553,"Look after him, Dodger.","Oliver!"
"1063",7023266,7025851,"And I'll look after meself.","Oliver!"
"1064",7036113,7038364,"A man's got a heart, hasn't he?","Oliver!"
"1065",7039616,7041951,"Joking apart, hasn't he?","Oliver!"
"1066",7042786,7049083,"And though I'd be the first one to saythat I wasn't a saint","Oliver!"
"1067",7049960,7056799,"I'm finding it hardTo be really as black as they paint","Oliver!"
"1068",7059553,7065891,"I'm reviewing the situation","Oliver!"
"1069",7065976,7069645,"Can a fellow be a villain all his life?","Oliver!"
"1070",7069813,7076902,"All the trials and tribulation!Better settle down and get myself a wife","Oliver!"
"1071",7076987,7080823,"And the wife would cook and sew for meAnd come for me, and go for me","Oliver!"
"1072",7080949,7084493,"And go for me and nag at meThe finger she would wag at me","Oliver!"
"1073",7084619,7088247,"The money she would take from meA misery she'd make for me","Oliver!"
"1074",7089166,7092168,"I think I'd better think it out again","Oliver!"
"1075",7094796,7101469,"A wife you can keep anywayI'd rather sleep anyway","Oliver!"
"1076",7103054,7107892,"Left without anyone in the worldAnd I'm starting from now","Oliver!"
"1077",7108727,7113814,"So how to win friendsand to influence people?","Oliver!"
"1078",7115066,7116525,"So how?","Oliver!"
"1079",7120238,7126076,"I'm reviewing the situation","Oliver!"
"1080",7126828,7129997,"I must quickly look up everyone I know","Oliver!"
"1081",7130373,7134084,"Titled people with a station","Oliver!"
"1082",7134169,7137755,"Who can help me makea real impressive show!","Oliver!"
"1083",7137839,7141425,"I will own a suite at Claridge'sAnd run a fleet of carriages","Oliver!"
"1084",7141510,7144678,"And wave at all the duchessesWith friendliness, as much as is","Oliver!"
"1085",7144763,7149600,"Befitting of my new estateGood morrow to you, Magistrate!","Oliver!"
"1086",7151686,7154104,"I think I'd better think it out again","Oliver!"
"1087",7156733,7158567,"So where shall I go?","Oliver!"
"1088",7159444,7161862,"Somebody!","Oliver!"
"1089",7162197,7165533,"Who do I know? Nobody!","Oliver!"
"1090",7166243,7171455,"All my dearest companionshave always been villains and thieves","Oliver!"
"1091",7171957,7176961,"So, at my time of lifeI should start turning over new leaves?","Oliver!"
"1092",7179214,7184760,"I'm reviewing the situation","Oliver!"
"1093",7184845,7188347,"If you want to eat, you've got to earn a bob","Oliver!"
"1094",7188515,7195145,"Is it such a humiliationFor a robber to perform an honest job?","Oliver!"
"1095",7195230,7199024,"So a job I'm getting, possiblyI wonder who my boss'll be?","Oliver!"
"1096",7199109,7202611,"I wonder if he'll take to me?What bonuses he'll make to me?","Oliver!"
"1097",7202696,7206282,"I'll start at 9:00 and finish lateAt normal rate and all, but wait!","Oliver!"
"1098",7206366,7208284,"I think I'd better think it out","Oliver!"
"1099",7210871,7212913,"I think I'd better think it out again!","Oliver!"
"1100",7226428,7231056,"What happens when I'm 70?","Oliver!"
"1101",7231808,7236562,"Must come a time, 70","Oliver!"
"1102",7237188,7239690,"When you're old and it's cold","Oliver!"
"1103",7239774,7245154,"And who cares if you live or you die?","Oliver!"
"1104",7248283,7255539,"Your one consolation'sthe money you may have put by","Oliver!"
"1105",7258168,7264256,"I'm reviewing the situation","Oliver!"
"1106",7264466,7267718,"I'm a bad 'un and a bad 'un I shall stay!","Oliver!"
"1107",7268053,7274308,"You'll be seeing no transformationBut it's wrong to be a rogue in every way","Oliver!"
"1108",7274976,7278812,"I don't want nobody hurt for meOr made to do the dirt for me","Oliver!"
"1109",7278897,7282107,"This rotten life is not for meIt's getting far too hot for me","Oliver!"
"1110",7282192,7286987,"There is no in-between for meBut who will change the scene for me?","Oliver!"
"1111",7287280,7290532,"Don't want no one to rob for me","Oliver!"
"1112",7290617,7296413,"But who will find a job for me?","Oliver!"
"1113",7298375,7301377,"I think I'd better think it out again!","Oliver!"
"1114",7302587,7305881,"And so, sir, the instant I received yourcommunication regarding dear little Oliver,","Oliver!"
"1115",7305966,7307925,"I decided we must takethe first coach to London.","Oliver!"
"1116",7308009,7310594,"-I decided.-That's right, sir, my dear wife decided.","Oliver!"
"1117",7310679,7313555,"It was good of you to come.Now, what have you got to tell me?","Oliver!"
"1118",7313640,7316183,"This locket, sir, once belongedto the boy's mother.","Oliver!"
"1119",7316267,7319019,"Found by the wife after she passed away.","Oliver!"
"1120",7319104,7321855,"The boy's mother, that is, not my dear wife.","Oliver!"
"1121",7333576,7337079,"-You've kept this all these years?-Why should I not?","Oliver!"
"1122",7337247,7341083,"Did it not occur to you that this mightprovide the answer to the boy's parentage?","Oliver!"
"1123",7341209,7343085,"His identity? His very name?","Oliver!"
"1124",7343169,7345337,"But he had no name, sir.The mother was unmarried.","Oliver!"
"1125",7345422,7349091,"It was your clear duty to show this evidenceto some higher authority.","Oliver!"
"1126",7349259,7352845,"-Your behavior, madam, was shameful!-How dare you speak to me so?","Oliver!"
"1127",7352929,7354847,"I only came here to help you.","Oliver!"
"1128",7355265,7358183,"You came here to profitfrom your own greed and dishonesty.","Oliver!"
"1129",7358268,7360853,"Sir, if you think the locketdon't properly belong to my dear wife...","Oliver!"
"1130",7360937,7362521,"-Be quiet, you old fool!-Here. Your reward,","Oliver!"
"1131",7362605,7363689,"and something for the locket. Take it.","Oliver!"
"1132",7363773,7365524,"Think yourselves luckyyou're not in the hands of the law.","Oliver!"
"1133",7365608,7369611,"-Mrs. Bedwin, show these people out.-There's gratitude for you!","Oliver!"
"1134",7371406,7375451,"I hope this unfortunate little circumstancewon't deprive me of my parochial office?","Oliver!"
"1135",7375577,7377453,"My hope, sir, is that it will.","Oliver!"
"1136",7377579,7380622,"But it was all Mrs. Bumble, sir.I knew nothing of it until yesterday.","Oliver!"
"1137",7380749,7384209,"That's no excuse. In the eyes of the law,you are the more guilty of the two.","Oliver!"
"1138",7384294,7387379,"For the law supposesthat your wife acts under your direction.","Oliver!"
"1139",7387464,7390382,"If that's what the law supposes, sir,then the law's an ass!","Oliver!"
"1140",7390467,7393135,"If that's the eye of the law, sir,then law is a bachelor!","Oliver!"

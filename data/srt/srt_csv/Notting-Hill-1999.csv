"580",2306600,2310400,"Having you here, Anna, firmlyestablishes what I've long suspected--","Notting Hill"
"581",2310440,2313160,"that we really are the mostdesperate lot of underachievers.","Notting Hill"
"582",2313200,2316040,"- Shame.- I'm not saying it's a bad thing.","Notting Hill"
"583",2316080,2319360,"in fact, I think it's somethingwe should take pride in.","Notting Hill"

"588",2330840,2333760,"I mean, I work in the city in a jobI don't understand,","Notting Hill"
"589",2333840,2336200,"and everyone keepsgetting promoted above me.","Notting Hill"
"590",2336240,2338720,"I haven't had a girlfriend since--well, since puberty.","Notting Hill"
"591",2338760,2341720,"And... nobody fancies me.","Notting Hill"
"592",2341800,2344240,"And if these cheeks get any chubbier,they never will.","Notting Hill"
"593",2344320,2347960,"- Nonsense. I fancy you.- Really?","Notting Hill"
"594",2348040,2350520,"Yeah. Or I didbefore you got so fat.","Notting Hill"
"595",2350600,2353400,"You see.And unless I'm much mistaken,","Notting Hill"
"596",2353480,2356000,"your job still pays yourather a lot of money...","Notting Hill"
"597",2356040,2358400,"whilst Honey hereearns 20 pence a week...","Notting Hill"
"598",2358440,2361160,"flogging her guts outin London's worst record store.","Notting Hill"
"599",2361240,2364240,"Yes! And I haven't got hair.I've got feathers.","Notting Hill"
"600",2364320,2368000,"And I've got funny goggly eyes.And I'm attracted to cruel men.","Notting Hill"
"601",2368040,2370520,"And, actually,no one will marry me...","Notting Hill"
"602",2370600,2373600,"because, um, my boosieshave actually started shrinking.","Notting Hill"
"603",2373640,2376000,"- You see, it's incredibly sad.- But on the other hand,","Notting Hill"
"604",2376040,2377760,"her best friend is Anna Scott.","Notting Hill"
"605",2377800,2381120,"That's true. I can't deny it.She needs me. What can I say?","Notting Hill"
"606",2382280,2385720,"And most of her limbs work, whereasI'm stuck in this thing day and night,","Notting Hill"
"607",2385800,2387720,"in a house full of ramps.","Notting Hill"
"608",2387800,2390560,"And to add insultto serious injury,","Notting Hill"
"609",2390600,2395680,"I've totally given up smoking,my favorite thing.","Notting Hill"
"610",2395720,2399920,"And, um, well, the truth is,","Notting Hill"
"611",2400000,2402120,"we can't have a baby.","Notting Hill"
"612",2407560,2409560,"Oh, Belle.","Notting Hill"
"613",2409640,2412960,"C'est la vie.","Notting Hill"
"614",2414560,2418280,"Still, um, we're lucky in lots of ways.","Notting Hill"
"615",2418320,2421240,"But surely that's worth a brownie.","Notting Hill"
"616",2422760,2427800,"Well, I don't know.Look at William.","Notting Hill"
"617",2427880,2430920,"- Very unsuccessful professionally.- That's true.","Notting Hill"
"618",2430960,2435640,"Divorced. Used to be handsome,now kind of squidgy round the edges.","Notting Hill"
"619",2436800,2439480,"And absolutely certain neverto hear from Anna again...","Notting Hill"
"620",2439560,2442480,"- once she's heard that his nickname at school was--- Floppy.","Notting Hill"
"621",2442560,2445600,"You did.I can't believe it, you did.","Notting Hill"
"622",2445640,2448920,"Thanks very much. Thank you.Well, at least I get the last brownie.","Notting Hill"
"623",2449000,2450840,"I think so, yes.","Notting Hill"
"624",2450920,2452800,"Well, wait.What about me?","Notting Hill"
"625",2454280,2458200,"I'm sorry?You think you deserve the brownie?","Notting Hill"
"626",2458280,2462320,"Well, a shot at it at least, huh?","Notting Hill"
"627",2462400,2465200,"You'll have to prove it.This is a very, very good brownie.","Notting Hill"
"628",2465280,2467840,"I'm gonna fight for it.","Notting Hill"
"629",2467880,2471120,"I've been on a dietevery day since I was 19,","Notting Hill"
"630",2471200,2474400,"which basically meansI've been hungry for a decade.","Notting Hill"
"631",2476520,2480000,"I've had a series of not-niceboyfriends, one of whom hit me.","Notting Hill"
"632",2480040,2483000,"Uh, and every timeI get my heart broken,","Notting Hill"
"633",2483080,2487240,"the newspapers splash it aboutas though it's entertainment.","Notting Hill"
"634",2489160,2494120,"And... it's taken two rather painful,um, operations...","Notting Hill"
"635",2494160,2496080,"to get me looking like this.","Notting Hill"
"636",2496160,2499160,"- Really?- Really.","Notting Hill"
"637",2501200,2505800,"And one day not long from now,my looks will go,","Notting Hill"
"638",2505880,2508600,"they will discover I can't act,","Notting Hill"
"639",2508680,2513320,"and I will becomesome sad, middle-aged woman...","Notting Hill"
"640",2513400,2518000,"who... looks a bit like someonewho was famous for a while.","Notting Hill"
"641",2525640,2528000,"No, nice try, gorgeous,but you don't fool anyone.","Notting Hill"
"642",2528040,2530560,"No.","Notting Hill"

"1401",5827160,5829000,"Twice.","Notting Hill"
"1402",5830560,5834560,"So it's just beensitting in the hotel.","Notting Hill"

"1427",5920040,5921960,"and it's now been about 24 hours...","Notting Hill"
"1428",5922000,5925320,"and the foot that was purpleis now sort of blackish in color and--","Notting Hill"

"1451",6010600,6014240,"I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,","Notting Hill"
"1452",6014320,6018040,"not often in and out of love.","Notting Hill"
"1453",6018120,6020160,"But, uh--","Notting Hill"
"1454",6024520,6026800,"Can I just say no to your...","Notting Hill"

"1461",6050520,6053840,"with you I'm in real... danger.","Notting Hill"
"1462",6053920,6056960,"it seems like a... perfect situation,","Notting Hill"
"1463",6057040,6060360,"apart from thatfoul temper of yours, but...","Notting Hill"
"1464",6060440,6064800,"my relatively inexperienced heartwould, I fear, not...","Notting Hill"
"1465",6064880,6067560,"recover, uh, if I was...","Notting Hill"
"1466",6067640,6071520,"once again cast aside,as I would absolutely expect to be.","Notting Hill"

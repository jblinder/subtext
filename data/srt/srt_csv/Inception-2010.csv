"240",1432704,1434673,"They don't actually come into the dream.","Inception"
"241",1434840,1438105,"They just design the levelsand teach them to the dreamers. That's all.","Inception"
"242",1438278,1439506,"Design it yourself.","Inception"

"261",1505678,1508875,"- Why?- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.","Inception"
"262",1511984,1516648,"You have two minutes to design a mazethat it takes one minute to solve.","Inception"
"263",1518590,1519717,"Stop.","Inception"

"265",1525498,1526828,"Stop.","Inception"
"266",1530002,1532061,"You're gonna have to do better than that.","Inception"
"267",1545084,1546346,"That's more like it.","Inception"
"268",1566538,1569440,"They say we only use a fractionof our brain's true potential.","Inception"
"269",1569608,1571304,"Now, that's when we're awake.","Inception"
"270",1571477,1574445,"When we're asleep,our mind can do almost anything.","Inception"
"271",1574614,1575637,"Such as?","Inception"
"272",1575815,1579807,"Imagine you're designing a building.You consciously create each aspect.","Inception"
"273",1579986,1583819,"But sometimes, it feels like it's almostcreating itself, if you know what I mean.","Inception"
"274",1583990,1585958,"Yeah, like I'm discovering it.","Inception"
"275",1586125,1588388,"Genuine inspiration, right?","Inception"
"276",1588560,1591894,"Now, in a dream,our mind continuously does this.","Inception"
"277",1592065,1596694,"We create and perceiveour world simultaneously.","Inception"
"278",1596868,1600269,"And our mind does this so wellthat we don't even know it's happening.","Inception"
"279",1600440,1603170,"That allows us to get rightin the middle of that process.","Inception"
"280",1603343,1605709,"- How?- By taking over the creating part.","Inception"
"281",1605877,1607505,"Now, this is where I need you.","Inception"
"282",1607680,1610046,"You create the world of the dream.","Inception"
"283",1610215,1615586,"We bring the subject into that dream,and they fill it with their subconscious.","Inception"
"284",1615755,1620419,"How could I ever acquire enough detailto make them think that it's reality?","Inception"
"285",1620593,1624050,"Well, dreams, they feel realwhile we're in them, right?","Inception"
"286",1624230,1627926,"It's only when we wake up that we realizesomething was actually strange.","Inception"
"287",1629402,1630800,"Let me ask you a question.","Inception"
"288",1630970,1634371,"You never really rememberthe beginning of a dream, do you?","Inception"
"289",1634539,1637566,"You always wind upright in the middle of what's going on.","Inception"
"290",1637743,1638768,"I guess, yeah.","Inception"
"291",1638944,1640502,"So how did we end up here?","Inception"
"292",1640913,1642971,"Well, we just came from the, uh...","Inception"
"293",1643182,1646617,"Think about it, Ariadne.How did you get here?","Inception"
"294",1647220,1649119,"Where are you right now?","Inception"
"295",1652424,1653585,"We're dreaming?","Inception"
"296",1653759,1656193,"You're in the middleof the workshop, sleeping.","Inception"
"297",1656362,1659330,"This is your first lessonin shared dreaming. Stay calm.","Inception"
"298",1696669,1698796,"If it's just a dream,then why are you-?","Inception"
"299",1700440,1702169,"Because it's never just a dream, is it?","Inception"
"300",1702340,1705640,"And a face full of glass hurts like hell.When you're in it, it feels real.","Inception"
"301",1705811,1708007,"That's why the militarydeveloped dream sharing.","Inception"
"302",1708181,1711877,"It was a training program for soldiersto shoot, stab and strangle each other...","Inception"
"303",1712050,1713176,"...and then wake up.","Inception"
"304",1713486,1715282,"How did architects become involved?","Inception"
"305",1715454,1718184,"Well, someone had to designthe dreams, right?","Inception"
"306",1719325,1721656,"Why don't you give usanother five minutes?","Inception"
"307",1721827,1722920,"Five minutes?","Inception"
"308",1724297,1726628,"What-? We were talkingfor, like, at least an hour.","Inception"
"309",1726798,1729028,"In a dream, your mindfunctions more quickly...","Inception"
"310",1729201,1732035,"...therefore time seemsto feel more slow.","Inception"
"311",1732204,1735572,"Five minutes in the real worldgives you an hour in the dream.","Inception"
"312",1736308,1739368,"Why don't you see what youcan get up to in five minutes?","Inception"
"313",1745284,1748219,"You've got the basic layout.Bookstore, café.","Inception"
"314",1748386,1750048,"Almost everything else is here too.","Inception"
"315",1750222,1753157,"Who are the people?- Projections of my subconscious.","Inception"
"316",1753326,1754486,"- Yours?- Yes.","Inception"
"317",1754660,1757184,"Remember, you are the dreamer.You build this world.","Inception"
"318",1757363,1760025,"I am the subject. My mind populates it.","Inception"
"319",1760199,1762098,"You can literally talkto my subconscious.","Inception"
"320",1762268,1765169,"That's one of the ways we extractinformation from the subject.","Inception"
"321",1765337,1766599,"How else do you do it?","Inception"
"322",1766806,1770765,"By creating something secure,like a bank vault or a jail.","Inception"
"323",1770942,1774673,"The mind automatically fills itwith information it's trying to protect.","Inception"
"324",1774846,1777611,"- You understand?- Then you break in and steal it?","Inception"
"325",1777782,1778807,"Well...","Inception"
"326",1778984,1783479,"I guess I thought that the dream spacewould be all about the visual...","Inception"
"327",1783655,1785520,"...but it's more about the feel of it.","Inception"
"328",1785991,1790122,"My question is what happens when youstart messing with the physics of it all?","Inception"
"329",1831470,1833028,"It's something, isn't it?","Inception"
"330",1834140,1835436,"Yes, it is.","Inception"
"331",1859365,1860888,"Why are they all looking at me?","Inception"
"332",1861067,1864558,"Because my subconscious feels thatsomeone else is creating this world.","Inception"
"333",1864737,1869037,"The more you change things, the quickerthe projections start to converge on you.","Inception"
"334",1869208,1870266,"Converge?","Inception"
"335",1870442,1872501,"They sense the foreign natureof the dreamer.","Inception"
"336",1872678,1875339,"They attack, like white blood cellsfighting an infection.","Inception"
"337",1875513,1878346,"- What, they're gonna attack us?- No, no.","Inception"
"338",1878917,1880476,"Just you.","Inception"
"339",1884390,1888655,"This is great, but I'm telling you,if you keep changing things like this...","Inception"
"340",1892163,1895133,"Jeez, mind telling your subconsciousto take it easy?","Inception"
"341",1895300,1897962,"It's my subconscious.Remember? I can't control it.","Inception"
"342",1951624,1952989,"Very impressive.","Inception"
"343",1964737,1968263,"I know this bridge.This place is real, isn't it?","Inception"
"344",1968441,1970772,"Yeah, I cross it every dayto get to the college.","Inception"
"345",1970942,1974378,"Never re-create places from your memory.Always imagine new places.","Inception"
"346",1974547,1976377,"You draw from stuff you know, right?","Inception"
"347",1976548,1980747,"Only use details. A streetlampor a phone booth. Never entire areas.","Inception"
"348",1980920,1983047,"- Why not?- Building a dream from your memory...","Inception"
"349",1983221,1986713,"...is the easiest way to lose your graspon what's real and what is a dream.","Inception"
"350",1986892,1988951,"- Is that what happened to you?- Listen to me.","Inception"
"351",1989127,1991118,"This has nothing to dowith me, understand?","Inception"
"352",1991297,1993265,"That why you need meto build your dreams?","Inception"
"353",1993432,1995957,"Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.","Inception"
"354",1996134,1997761,"- Cobb! Cobb!- Get off of her!","Inception"
"355",1997936,1999871,"- Let me go! Let me go!- Mal!","Inception"
"356",2000372,2002464,"- Mal!- Cobb! Wake me up!","Inception"
"357",2002641,2004438,"- Wake me up! Wake me up!- No!","Inception"
"358",2004609,2006099,"- Mal, no! No!- Wake me up!","Inception"
"359",2007747,2011705,"Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.You're okay. You're okay.","Inception"
"360",2011884,2015115,"- Hey.- Why wouldn't I wake up?","Inception"
"361",2015421,2017012,"There was still time on the clock.","Inception"
"362",2017189,2019713,"You can't wake up fromwithin the dream unless you die.","Inception"
"363",2019892,2021483,"- She'll need a totem.What?","Inception"
"364",2021660,2023126,"A totem, it's a small personal-","Inception"
"365",2023295,2025819,"That's some subconsciousyou've got on you, Cobb!","Inception"
"366",2025998,2027828,"- She's a real charmer.- Oh.","Inception"
"367",2028000,2030627,"- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.- She's his wife?","Inception"
"368",2030802,2034534,"Yeah. So a totem. You needa small object, potentially heavy.","Inception"
"369",2034707,2037174,"Something you can have on youthat no one else knows.","Inception"
"370",2037343,2038605,"Like a coin?No.","Inception"
"371",2038778,2043407,"It needs to be more unique than that.Like, this is a loaded die.","Inception"
"372",2044517,2047417,"No, I can't let you touch it.That would defeat the purpose.","Inception"
"373",2047586,2051784,"See, only I know the balance andthe weight of this particular loaded die.","Inception"
"374",2051956,2053788,"That way,when you look at your totem...","Inception"
"375",2053958,2057052,"...you know beyond a doubt thatyou're not in someone else's dream.","Inception"
"376",2060498,2064798,"I don't know if you can't see what'sgoing on, or if you just don't want to...","Inception"
"377",2064969,2068496,"...but Cobb has some serious problemsthat he's tried to bury down there.","Inception"
"378",2068673,2072610,"And I'm not about to just open my mindto someone like that.","Inception"
"379",2078751,2082152,"She'll be back. I've never seen anyonepick it up that quickly before.","Inception"
"380",2082621,2086818,"Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,and when she comes back...","Inception"
"381",2087492,2090155,"When she comes back,you're gonna have her building mazes.","Inception"
"382",2090329,2092592,"- Where are you gonna be?- I gotta go visit Eames.","Inception"
"383",2092764,2095893,"Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.It's Cobol's back yard.","Inception"
"384",2096068,2097659,"It's a necessary risk.","Inception"
"385",2098070,2101300,"- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.- We don't just need a thief.","Inception"
"386",2102440,2103465,"We need a forger.","Inception"
"387",2112184,2114744,"Rub them together all you want,they're not gonna breed.","Inception"
"388",2115320,2116344,"You never know.","Inception"
"389",2117289,2119313,"I'm gonna get you a drink.","Inception"
"390",2121492,2122858,"You're buying.","Inception"
"391",2129335,2131632,"- Your spelling hasn't improved.- Piss off.","Inception"
"392",2131804,2133771,"How's your handwriting?","Inception"
"393",2133938,2135769,"- It's versatile.- Good.","Inception"
"394",2135940,2137168,"Thank you very much.","Inception"
"395",2137842,2139208,"Inception.","Inception"
"396",2139445,2142277,"Now, before you bother telling meit's impossible, let me-","Inception"
"397",2142447,2145746,"No, it's perfectly possible.It's just bloody difficult.","Inception"
"398",2145918,2149182,"Interesting. Because Arthur keepstelling me it can't be done.","Inception"
"399",2149621,2152590,"Hmm. Arthur. You still workingwith that stick in the mud?","Inception"
"400",2152757,2154452,"He is good at what he does, right?","Inception"
"401",2154626,2156686,"Oh, he's the best,but he has no imagination.","Inception"
"402",2156862,2157885,"Not like you.","Inception"
"403",2158063,2161032,"Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,you need imagination.","Inception"
"404",2161199,2164760,"Let me ask you something.Have you done it before?","Inception"
"405",2164936,2168565,"We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,but it didn't take.","Inception"
"406",2168740,2172074,"- You didn't plant it deep enough?- No, it's not just about depth.","Inception"
"407",2172244,2174235,"You need the simplest versionof the idea...","Inception"
"408",2174413,2178076,"...in order for it to grow naturallyin your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.","Inception"
"409",2178250,2180775,"So, what is this ideathat you need to plant?","Inception"
"410",2180952,2185150,"We need the heir of a major corporationto dissolve his father's empire.","Inception"
"411",2185324,2187757,"Right there you havevarious political motivations...","Inception"
"412",2187927,2189918,"...and anti-monopolistic sentimentsand so forth.","Inception"
"413",2190094,2191925,"But all of that stuff, it's, um...","Inception"
"414",2192097,2194963,"It's really at the mercy of yoursubject's prejudice, you see?","Inception"
"415",2195134,2197625,"What you have to do isstart at the absolute basic.","Inception"
"416",2197802,2199360,"Which is what?","Inception"
"417",2199871,2201771,"The relationship with the father.","Inception"
"418",2203976,2205637,"- Do you have a chemist?- No, not yet.","Inception"

"421",2212650,2213947,"Why don't you take me there?","Inception"
"422",2214119,2217179,"Once you've lost your tail.The man at the bar.","Inception"

"443",2379650,2381380,"Cobb said you'd be back.","Inception"
"444",2382521,2386047,"- I tried not to come, but...- But there's nothing quite like it.","Inception"
"445",2386224,2387885,"It's just...","Inception"
"446",2389393,2390724,"...pure creation.","Inception"
"447",2390896,2393387,"Shall we take a lookat some paradoxical architecture?","Inception"
"448",2393565,2395556,"You're gonna have to mastera few tricks...","Inception"
"449",2395733,2399260,"...if you're gonna build three completedream levels. Excuse me.","Inception"
"450",2399438,2400871,"What kind of tricks?","Inception"
"451",2401039,2404530,"In a dream, you can cheat architectureinto impossible shapes.","Inception"
"452",2404710,2408612,"That lets you create closed loops,like the Penrose Steps.","Inception"
"453",2409481,2411472,"The infinite staircase.","Inception"
"454",2414186,2415619,"See?","Inception"
"455",2419791,2420849,"Paradox.","Inception"
"456",2421025,2422425,"So a closed loop like that...","Inception"
"457",2422594,2425688,"...will help you disguise the boundariesof the dream you create.","Inception"
"458",2425864,2427831,"But how big do these levels have to be?","Inception"
"459",2428000,2431128,"It could be anythingfrom the floor of a building to an entire city.","Inception"
"460",2431302,2434739,"They have to be complicated enoughthat we can hide from the projections.","Inception"
"461",2434907,2436306,"- A maze?- Right, a maze.","Inception"
"462",2436474,2437806,"And the better the maze...","Inception"
"463",2438010,2440672,"Then the longer we havebefore the projections catch us?","Inception"
"464",2440846,2442108,"Exactly.","Inception"
"465",2442780,2446409,"- My subconscious seems polite enough.- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.","Inception"
"466",2446585,2449485,"No one likes to feel someone elsemessing around in their mind.","Inception"
"467",2449655,2451748,"Cobb can't build anymore, can he?","Inception"
"468",2453592,2455422,"I don't know if he can't, but he won't.","Inception"
"469",2455594,2457994,"He thinks it's saferif he doesn't know the layouts.","Inception"
"470",2458163,2459255,"Why?","Inception"
"471",2459431,2461661,"He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.","Inception"
"472",2462099,2464398,"- His ex-wife?- No, not his ex.","Inception"
"473",2464570,2467733,"- They're still together?- No.","Inception"
"474",2468974,2470463,"No, she's dead.","Inception"
"475",2472443,2475173,"What you see in thereis just his projection of her.","Inception"
"476",2478717,2480184,"What was she like in real life?","Inception"
"477",2480851,2482376,"She was lovely.","Inception"
"478",2486090,2488456,"You are seeking a chemist?Yes.","Inception"
"479",2488626,2490753,"To formulate compounds for a job?","Inception"
"480",2491429,2493295,"And to go into the field with us.","Inception"
"481",2493465,2495695,"No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.","Inception"
"482",2495867,2499597,"Well, we'd need you there to tailorcompounds specific to our needs.","Inception"
"483",2499771,2501864,"- Which are?- Great depth.","Inception"
"484",2502039,2505304,"A dream within a dream? Two levels?","Inception"
"485",2508079,2509103,"Three.","Inception"
"486",2509280,2512842,"Not possible. That many dreamswithin dreams is too unstable.","Inception"
"487",2513018,2516976,"It is possible.You just have to add a sedative.","Inception"
"488",2517155,2519817,"A powerful sedative.","Inception"
"489",2521626,2523856,"- How many team members?- Five.","Inception"
"490",2524028,2525757,"Six.","Inception"
"491",2526632,2530659,"The only way to know you've done the jobis if I go in with you.","Inception"
"492",2530835,2533929,"There's no room for touristson a job like this, Mr. Saito.","Inception"
"493",2534106,2536472,"This time, it seems there is.","Inception"
"494",2537409,2541139,"This, I think, is a good place to start.I use it every day.","Inception"
"495",2541313,2543440,"What for?- Here, I'll show you.","Inception"
"496",2547753,2549481,"Perhaps you will not want to see.","Inception"
"497",2552423,2554016,"After you.","Inception"
"498",2563335,2566327,"Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.","Inception"
"499",2566505,2568268,"They come every day to share the dream.","Inception"
"500",2571309,2573869,"You see? Very stable.","Inception"
"501",2579583,2583644,"- How long do they dream for?Three, four hours, each day.","Inception"
"502",2583922,2584945,"In dream time?","Inception"
"503",2585123,2588786,"With this compound? About 40 hours,each and every day.","Inception"
"504",2588960,2592259,"- Why do they do it?Tell him, Mr. Cobb.","Inception"
"505",2593798,2596233,"After a while, it becomesthe only way you can dream.","Inception"
"506",2596400,2598335,"Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?","Inception"
"507",2598969,2602371,"- They come here every day to sleep?No.","Inception"
"508",2604108,2606804,"They come to be woken up.","Inception"
"509",2607813,2611112,"The dream has become their reality.","Inception"
"510",2612050,2614416,"Who are you to say otherwise, sir?","Inception"
"511",2616722,2618349,"Let's see what you can do.","Inception"
"512",2629333,2630925,"You know how to find me.","Inception"
"513",2633538,2635528,"You know what you have to do.","Inception"
"514",2640778,2641836,"Sharp, no?","Inception"
"515",2657429,2660262,"Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?","Inception"
"516",2660798,2664565,"Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.","Inception"
"517",2673010,2676708,"Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrowenergy conglomerate.","Inception"
"518",2676882,2678782,"What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?","Inception"
"519",2678949,2680541,"That's not your concern.","Inception"
"520",2680952,2685320,"Mr. Saito, this isn't your typicalcorporate espionage.","Inception"
"521",2685489,2687081,"You asked me for inception.","Inception"
"522",2687259,2690626,"I do hope you understandthe gravity of that request.","Inception"
"523",2690795,2694755,"Now, the seed that we plantin this man's mind will grow into an idea.","Inception"
"524",2694932,2696797,"This idea will define him.","Inception"
"525",2696967,2698798,"It may come to change...","Inception"
"526",2698969,2701268,"Well, it may come to changeeverything about him.","Inception"
"527",2701440,2705773,"We're the last company standingbetween them and total energy dominance.","Inception"
"528",2705943,2708003,"And we can no longer compete.","Inception"
"529",2708179,2711637,"Soon, they'll control the energy supplyof half the world.","Inception"
"530",2711817,2714182,"In effect, they becomea new superpower.","Inception"
"531",2715586,2718920,"The world needs Robert Fischerto change his mind.","Inception"
"532",2719090,2720648,"That's where we come in.","Inception"
"533",2720826,2724090,"How is Robert Fischer's relationshipwith his father?","Inception"
"534",2724262,2726992,"Rumor is the relationshipis quite complicated.","Inception"
"535",2727164,2729655,"Well, we can't work basedsolely on rumor, can we?","Inception"
"536",2729835,2733032,"Can you get me access to this man here?Browning.","Inception"
"537",2733204,2737369,"Fischer Senior's right-hand man.Fischer Junior's godfather.","Inception"
"538",2737541,2740806,"It should be possible,if you can get the right references.","Inception"
"539",2740978,2745438,"References are somethingof a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.","Inception"
"540",2746083,2749018,"I'm not smellingsettlement here. Take them down.","Inception"
"541",2749186,2750278,"Mr. Browning...","Inception"
"542",2750454,2754289,"...Maurice Fischer's policyis always one of avoiding litigation.","Inception"
"543",2756862,2761322,"Well, shall we voice your concernswith Maurice directly?","Inception"
"544",2761500,2762898,"Not sure that's necessary.","Inception"
"545",2763068,2765730,"No, no, no. I think we should.","Inception"
"546",2787025,2788583,"How is he?","Inception"
"547",2789427,2792190,"I don't want to bother himunnecessarily, but-","Inception"
"548",2792364,2797824,"Robert, I told you keep outthe damn- Wait. So do it. Get-","Inception"
"549",2798103,2801197,"Mr. Fischer.Put it through.","Inception"
"550",2801572,2805168,"Never, never.Never do the same as I asked.","Inception"
"551",2806478,2808139,"Leave that.","Inception"
"552",2811849,2813215,"Here.","Inception"
"553",2815487,2817887,"Must be a cherished memory of his.","Inception"
"554",2818989,2823518,"I put it beside his bed.He hasn't even noticed.","Inception"
"555",2823695,2825356,"Robert...","Inception"
"556",2827731,2830132,"...we need to talk abouta power of attorney.","Inception"
"557",2830302,2833601,"- I know this is hard, but it's imperative-- Not now, Uncle Peter.","Inception"
"558",2837608,2839405,"The vultures are circling.","Inception"
"559",2839577,2843981,"And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.","Inception"
"560",2844148,2846548,"I've had ample opportunityto observe Browning...","Inception"
"561",2847184,2851554,"...and adopt his physical presence, study hismannerisms, and so on and so forth.","Inception"
"562",2851722,2855590,"So now in the first layer of the dream,I can impersonate Browning.","Inception"
"563",2855760,2858990,"And suggest conceptsto Fischer's conscious mind.","Inception"
"564",2859164,2860994,"Then, when we take hima level deeper...","Inception"
"565",2861166,2864657,"...his own projection of Browningshould feed that right back to him.","Inception"
"566",2864835,2866769,"So he gives himself the idea.","Inception"
"567",2866938,2871170,"Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.It has to seem self-generated.","Inception"
"568",2871342,2874744,"Eames, I am impressed.","Inception"
"569",2874913,2878474,"Your condescension, as always,is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.","Inception"
"570",2899838,2901829,"Were you going under on your own?","Inception"
"571",2902007,2905498,"No, no, I was just, uh, runningsome experiments.","Inception"
"572",2905677,2907644,"I didn't realize anyone was here, so...","Inception"
"573",2907811,2910474,"Yeah, I was just-I was working on my totem, actually.","Inception"
"574",2910648,2911809,"Here, let me take a look.","Inception"
"575",2913985,2915282,"So you're learning, huh?","Inception"
"576",2915452,2918945,"An elegant solutionfor keeping track of reality.","Inception"
"577",2919590,2921990,"- Was it your idea?- No, it was, uh...","Inception"
"578",2922226,2924286,"It was Mal's, actually. This...","Inception"
"579",2924996,2928762,"This one was hers. She would spin itin the dream and it would never topple.","Inception"
"580",2928967,2931867,"Just spin and spin.","Inception"
"581",2933405,2935338,"Arthur told me she passed away.","Inception"
"582",2937242,2939300,"How are the mazes coming along?","Inception"
"583",2939476,2942378,"Each level relates to the partof the subject's subconscious...","Inception"
"584",2942547,2944014,"...that we are trying to access.","Inception"
"585",2944181,2949619,"So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,so Fischer will bring his father.","Inception"
"586",2949987,2952751,"You know, l- Actually, I have a questionabout this layout.","Inception"
"587",2952923,2957657,"No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.Only the dreamer should know the layout.","Inception"
"588",2957829,2958989,"Why is that so important?","Inception"
"589",2959164,2961155,"In case one of us brings inour projections.","Inception"
"590",2961331,2963664,"We don't want them knowingthe details of the maze.","Inception"
"591",2965070,2967538,"You mean in case you bring Mal in.","Inception"
"592",2967706,2970106,"You can't keep her out, can you?","Inception"
"593",2971009,2972532,"- Right.- You can't build...","Inception"
"594",2972710,2976010,"...because if you know the maze,then she knows it.","Inception"
"595",2976181,2978376,"Well, she'd sabotagethe whole operation.","Inception"
"596",2978550,2981347,"- Cobb, do the others know?- No. No, they don't.","Inception"
"597",2981518,2983748,"You've gotta warn themif this is getting worse.","Inception"
"598",2983922,2985856,"No one said it's getting worse.","Inception"
"599",2987057,2990356,"I need to get home.That's all I care about right now.","Inception"
"600",2991228,2993288,"Why can't you go home?","Inception"
"601",2996400,2998425,"Because they think I killed her.","Inception"
"602",3001672,3003936,"- Thank you.- For what?","Inception"
"603",3004141,3006405,"For not asking whether I did.","Inception"
"604",3006577,3008739,"""I will split up my father's empire.""","Inception"
"605",3008913,3013110,"Now, this is obviously an idea thatRobert himself would choose to reject...","Inception"
"606",3013284,3016081,"...which is why we need to plant it deepin his subconscious.","Inception"
"607",3016253,3019780,"The subconscious is motivatedby emotion, right? Not reason.","Inception"
"608",3019958,3023724,"We need to find a way to translate thisinto an emotional concept.","Inception"
"609",3023894,3026329,"How do you translate business strategyinto emotion?","Inception"
"610",3026498,3030092,"That's what we're here to figure out.Robert's relationship with his father...","Inception"
"611",3030268,3032998,"...is stressed, to say the least.- Can we run with that?","Inception"
"612",3033170,3036766,"We suggest breaking up his father'scompany as a ""screw you"" to the old man.","Inception"
"613",3036940,3040398,"No, because I think positive emotiontrumps negative emotion every time.","Inception"
"614",3040811,3044509,"We all yearn for reconciliation,for catharsis.","Inception"
"615",3044681,3048447,"We need Robert Fischer to havea positive emotional reaction to all this.","Inception"
"616",3048619,3050451,"All right, well, try this. Um...","Inception"
"617",3050621,3055355,"""My father accepts that I want to createfor myself, not follow in his footsteps.""","Inception"
"618",3055760,3056818,"That might work.","Inception"
"619",3056994,3060157,"Might? We're gonna need to doa little better than ""might.""","Inception"
"620",3060331,3062298,"Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.","Inception"
"621",3062467,3065402,"Forgive me for wantinga little specificity, Eames.","Inception"
"622",3065603,3066695,"Specificity?","Inception"
"623",3066871,3068702,"Inception's not about being specific.","Inception"
"624",3068873,3072831,"When we get inside his mind, we'regonna have to work with what we find.","Inception"
"625",3074144,3077137,"On the top level, we open uphis relationship with his father...","Inception"
"626",3077315,3080375,"...and say, ""I will not followin my father's footsteps.""","Inception"
"627",3080552,3085215,"Then the next level down, we feed him,""I will create something for myself.""","Inception"
"628",3085389,3088722,"Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,we bring out the big guns.","Inception"
"629",3088893,3091293,"- ""My father doesn't want me to be him.""Exactly.","Inception"
"630",3092664,3096657,"Three layers down, the dreams are gonnacollapse with the slightest disturbance.","Inception"
"631",3096835,3097994,"Sedation.","Inception"
"632",3098168,3101001,"For sleep stable enough to createthree layers of dreaming...","Inception"
"633",3101172,3105074,"...we'll have to combine it withan extremely powerful sedative.","Inception"
"634",3116521,3117579,"Good night.","Inception"
"635",3118188,3120384,"The compound we'll be usingto share the dream...","Inception"
"636",3120557,3122492,"...creates a clear connectionbetween dreamers...","Inception"
"637",3122659,3126891,"...whilst accelerating brain function.- In other words, more time on each level.","Inception"
"638",3127065,3130228,"Brain function in the dream will beabout 20 times normal.","Inception"
"639",3130400,3133893,"And when you enter a dream withinthat dream, the effect is compounded.","Inception"
"640",3134072,3136164,"It's three dreams,that's 10 hours times 20-","Inception"
"641",3136340,3139242,"Math was never my strong subject.How much time is that?","Inception"
"642",3139409,3142072,"It's a week, the first level down.","Inception"
"643",3142780,3145612,"Six months the second level down,and the third level-","Inception"
"644",3145782,3147215,"That's 10 years.","Inception"
"645",3149853,3152014,"Who'd wanna be stuckin a dream for 10 years?","Inception"
"646",3152422,3153583,"Depends on the dream.","Inception"
"647",3153757,3156056,"So once we've made the plant,how do we get out?","Inception"
"648",3156226,3159559,"I'm hoping you have something moreelegant than shooting me in the head.","Inception"
"649",3159731,3162494,"- A kick.- What's a kick?","Inception"
"650",3162666,3165362,"This, Ariadne, would be a kick.","Inception"
"651",3167505,3170201,"It's that feeling of falling you getthat jolts you awake.","Inception"
"652",3170375,3173606,"- Snaps you out of the dream.- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?","Inception"
"653",3173777,3174972,"That's the clever part.","Inception"
"654",3175146,3178376,"I customized the sedative to leaveinner-ear function unimpaired.","Inception"
"655",3178548,3183384,"That way, however deep the sleep,the sleeper still feels falling.","Inception"

"811",4073677,4076237,"- How could he be trained?- Fischer's had an extractor...","Inception"
"812",4076413,4080610,"...teach his subconscious to defend itself,so his subconscious is militarized.","Inception"
"813",4080784,4082411,"It should've shown in the research.","Inception"

"829",4117921,4119752,"- We drop into limbo.- Are you serious?","Inception"
"830",4119922,4122448,"- Limbo?Unconstructed dream space.","Inception"
"831",4122626,4125890,"Well, what the hell is down there?- Just raw, infinite subconscious.","Inception"
"832",4126063,4129260,"Nothing is down there, except forwhat might have been left behind...","Inception"
"833",4129432,4132333,"...by anyone sharing the dreamwho's been trapped there before.","Inception"
"834",4132502,4134402,"Which, in our case, is just you.","Inception"
"835",4134570,4137266,"- How long could we be stuck?Can't even think about...","Inception"
"836",4137440,4139841,"...trying to escape until the sedation-- How long?","Inception"
"837",4140010,4143240,"Decades. It could be infinite.Ask him, he's the one who's been there.","Inception"

"839",4146250,4147682,"Great.","Inception"
"840",4148685,4150152,"Thank you.","Inception"

"842",4154257,4155725,"And if we get killed...","Inception"
"843",4155893,4159123,"...we'll be lost in limbo till our brainsturn to scrambled egg, hmm?","Inception"
"844",4166036,4167867,"Someone got first aid?","Inception"
"845",4170140,4173597,"- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?- There weren't meant to be risks.","Inception"
"846",4173777,4176712,"- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.- You had no right.","Inception"
"847",4176880,4179212,"This was the only wayto go three layers deep.","Inception"
"848",4179382,4181408,"You knew about thisand went along with it?","Inception"
"849",4181585,4182609,"I trusted him.","Inception"
"850",4182786,4184685,"When? When he promised youhalf his share?","Inception"
"851",4184854,4188119,"No. His whole share.Besides, he said he'd done it before.","Inception"
"852",4188292,4190350,"What, with Mal?Because that worked so good?","Inception"
"853",4190527,4193962,"That has nothing to do with it.I did what I had to to get to my children.","Inception"
"854",4194131,4196030,"You led us into a war zonewith no way out?","Inception"
"855",4196198,4200225,"There is a way out. We continue on withthe job, and we do it as fast as possible...","Inception"
"856",4200404,4202735,"...and we get out using the kick,just like before.","Inception"
"857",4202905,4205373,"Forget it. We go any deeper,we just raise the stakes.","Inception"
"858",4205542,4207407,"I am sitting this one out on this level.","Inception"
"859",4207577,4210011,"Fischer's securityis surrounding this place.","Inception"
"860",4210180,4212444,"Ten hours of flight timeis a week at this level.","Inception"
"861",4212615,4216346,"That means each and every one of uswill be killed. That I can guarantee you.","Inception"
"862",4216953,4220720,"We have no other choice but to continue onand do it as fast as possible.","Inception"
"863",4222326,4224760,"Downwards is the only way forwards.","Inception"
"864",4226329,4227456,"Get ready.","Inception"
"865",4227631,4229826,"You, come on. Let's go shake him up.","Inception"

"1105",5180055,5181180,"About $500, right?","Inception"

"1107",5184493,5186426,"Who or what is Mr. Charles?","Inception"
"1108",5186628,5190326,"It's a gambit designed to turn Fischeragainst his own subconscious.","Inception"
"1109",5190498,5191829,"And why don't you approve?","Inception"
"1110",5192001,5193992,"It involves telling the markthat he's dreaming...","Inception"
"1111",5194170,5196296,"...which involves attractinga lot of attention to us.","Inception"
"1112",5196471,5199407,"- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?- Hmm.","Inception"
"1113",5199574,5201337,"So now you've noticed how much time...","Inception"

"1132",5268777,5273372,"I specialize in a very specific typeof security.","Inception"
"1133",5273782,5275443,"Subconscious security.","Inception"
"1134",5275618,5277711,"You're talking about dreams?","Inception"

"1141",5326301,5328327,"Strange weather, isn't it?","Inception"
"1142",5333175,5334301,"You feel that?","Inception"
"1143",5336278,5337471,"What's happening?","Inception"
"1144",5337645,5340877,"Cobb's drawing Fischer's attentionto the strangeness of the dream...","Inception"
"1145",5341050,5343917,"...which is making his subconsciouslook for the dreamer.","Inception"
"1146",5344086,5347145,"For me. Quick, give me a kiss.","Inception"
"1147",5352161,5356029,"- They're still looking at us.- Yeah, it was worth a shot.","Inception"
"1148",5356698,5358724,"We should probably get out of here.","Inception"
"1149",5374015,5377577,"You feel that? You've actuallybeen trained for this, Mr. Fischer.","Inception"
"1150",5377752,5381746,"Pay attention to the strangenessof the weather, the shift in gravity.","Inception"
"1151",5381923,5385087,"None of this is real. You're in a dream.","Inception"
"1152",5389898,5392127,"Now, the easiest wayfor you to test yourself...","Inception"
"1153",5392333,5396395,"...is to try and remember how you arrivedat this hotel. Can you do that?","Inception"
"1154",5397238,5398536,"Yeah, I...","Inception"
"1155",5398707,5401231,"No, breathe, breathe.Remember your training.","Inception"

"1172",5469978,5472275,"I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.","Inception"
"1173",5483992,5487587,"If this is a dream, I should justkill myself to wake up, right?","Inception"
"1174",5487762,5489855,"I wouldn't do that if I were you,Mr. Fischer.","Inception"
"1175",5490032,5493524,"I believe they have you sedated,and if you pull that trigger...","Inception"
"1176",5493702,5494862,"...you may not wake up.","Inception"
"1177",5496003,5500304,"You may go into a further dream state.Now, you know what I'm talking about.","Inception"
"1178",5502644,5504305,"You remember the training.","Inception"
"1179",5505447,5506845,"Remember what I said to you.","Inception"
"1180",5507716,5508876,"Give me the gun.","Inception"
"1181",5520695,5523289,"- This room should be directly below 528?- Yeah.","Inception"
"1182",5532673,5534163,"Think, Mr. Fischer, think.","Inception"
"1183",5534342,5538176,"What do you rememberfrom before this dream?","Inception"
"1184",5538546,5541175,"There was, um, a lot of gunfire.","Inception"
"1185",5541350,5543944,"There was rain.","Inception"
"1186",5544485,5546078,"Uncle Peter.","Inception"
"1187",5546354,5549984,"- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.- Where were they holding you?","Inception"
"1188",5553028,5556292,"- They had us in the back of a van.- That explains the gravity shifts.","Inception"
"1189",5556497,5558556,"You're in the back of a van.Keep going.","Inception"
"1190",5558734,5560997,"It had something to do with, um...","Inception"
"1191",5561636,5564503,"Something to do with a safe.","Inception"
"1192",5565140,5566766,"God, why is it so hard to remember?","Inception"
"1193",5566942,5569637,"It's like trying to remember a dreamafter you've woken up.","Inception"
"1194",5569811,5571541,"Listen, it takes years of practice.","Inception"
"1195",5571712,5574113,"You and Browning have been pulledinto this dream...","Inception"
"1196",5574283,5577046,"...because they're trying to stealsomething from your mind.","Inception"
"1197",5577219,5580779,"I need you to focus and tryand remember what that is.","Inception"
"1198",5580956,5582582,"What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!","Inception"
"1199",5582757,5586488,"A combination. They demandedthe first numbers to pop into my head.","Inception"
"1200",5586662,5589391,"They're trying to extract a numberfrom your subconscious.","Inception"
"1201",5589564,5593331,"It can represent anything.We're in a hotel right now.","Inception"
"1202",5594136,5597264,"We should try hotel rooms.What was the number, Mr. Fischer?","Inception"
"1203",5597439,5600271,"Try and remember for me.This is very important.","Inception"
"1204",5600442,5601773,"Five.","Inception"
"1205",5602743,5605177,"Five, two- It was something,it was a long number.","Inception"
"1206",5605346,5607439,"That's good. We can start there.Fifth floor.","Inception"
"1207",5607615,5608640,"Yep.","Inception"
"1208",5608817,5612844,"- So do you use a timer?- No, I have to judge it for myself.","Inception"
"1209",5613055,5616319,"While you're all asleep in 528,I wait for Yusuf's kick.","Inception"
"1210",5616490,5618618,"- Well, how will you know?- His music warns me.","Inception"
"1211",5618793,5622729,"And then when the van hits the barrierof the bridge, that should be unmistakable.","Inception"
"1212",5622898,5626095,"So we get a nice synchronized kick.","Inception"
"1213",5626268,5628667,"If it's too soon,we won't get pulled out.","Inception"
"1214",5628837,5632101,"But if it's too late,I won't be able to drop us.","Inception"
"1215",5632274,5636073,"- Well, why not?- Because the van will be in freefall.","Inception"
"1216",5636612,5639444,"- Can't drop you without gravity.- Right.","Inception"
"1217",5645087,5647317,"They're with me. Go on.","Inception"
"1218",5671646,5672671,"Mr. Charles.","Inception"
"1219",5672847,5675817,"- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?- Yeah, I think so.","Inception"
"1220",5675984,5678042,"They were trying to put you under.","Inception"
"1221",5678487,5680546,"- I'm already under.- Under again.","Inception"
"1222",5680721,5683282,"What do you mean,a dream within a dream?","Inception"
"1223",5683891,5686359,"Hey. I see you've changed.","Inception"
"1224",5686528,5688154,"I'm sorry?","Inception"
"1225",5688663,5692532,"Oh, I'm sorry.I mistook you for a friend.","Inception"
"1226",5692701,5693962,"Oh.","Inception"
"1227",5694136,5696262,"Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.","Inception"
"1228",5696939,5699873,"No, no, no. That's Fischer'sprojection of Browning.","Inception"
"1229",5700042,5701907,"Let's follow himand see how he behaves.","Inception"
"1230",5702077,5704045,"- Why?- Because how he acts will tell us...","Inception"
"1231",5704212,5707545,"...if Fischer is starting to suspecthis motives the way we want him to.","Inception"
"1232",5707716,5708739,"Shh.","Inception"
"1233",5713322,5715813,"- Uncle Peter.- You said you were kidnapped together?","Inception"
"1234",5715990,5719426,"Well, not exactly. They already had him.They were torturing him.","Inception"
"1235",5719594,5721060,"And you saw them torture him?","Inception"
"1236",5728603,5730434,"The kidnappers are working for you?","Inception"
"1237",5731405,5732872,"Robert.","Inception"
"1238",5733041,5736875,"You're trying to get that safe open?To get the alternate will?","Inception"
"1239",5737279,5741511,"Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.I can't let you destroy it.","Inception"
"1240",5741682,5744048,"I'm not gonna throw awaymy inheritance.","Inception"

"1242",5749190,5752216,"- What taunt?- The will, Robert. That will?","Inception"
"1243",5752394,5754328,"That's his last insult.","Inception"
"1244",5754496,5758125,"A challenge for you to build somethingfor yourself...","Inception"
"1245",5758300,5762100,"...by telling you you're not worthyof his accomplishments.","Inception"
"1246",5767775,5773145,"- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?- I'm sorry.","Inception"
"1247",5774515,5777609,"But he's wrong.","Inception"
"1248",5778353,5780980,"You can build a better companythan he ever did.","Inception"
"1249",5781155,5783590,"Mr. Fischer? He's lying.","Inception"
"1250",5783759,5785851,"- How do you know?- Trust me, it's what I do.","Inception"
"1251",5786028,5788792,"He's hiding something,and we need to find out what that is.","Inception"
"1252",5789997,5793399,"I need you to do the same thing to himthat he was going to do to you.","Inception"
"1253",5795970,5800032,"We'll enter his subconscious and find outwhat he doesn't want you to know.","Inception"

"1255",5808750,5810011,"He's out.- Wait.","Inception"
"1256",5810185,5812243,"Whose subconscious arewe going into exactly?","Inception"
"1257",5812421,5813752,"We're going into Fischer's.","Inception"
"1258",5813921,5816618,"I told him it was Browning'sso he'd be a part of our team.","Inception"
"1259",5816792,5819123,"He's gonna help us breakinto his own subconscious.","Inception"
"1260",5819293,5820851,"That's right.","Inception"
"1261",5821029,5823087,"Security's gonna run you down hard.","Inception"
"1262",5823265,5825596,"And I will lead them on a merry chase.","Inception"
"1263",5826167,5828796,"- Just be back before the kick.- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.","Inception"
"1264",5834009,5835203,"You good?","Inception"
"1265",5838380,5839711,"Hey. You ready?","Inception"

"1275",6052594,6055061,"If I know the route,everything could be compromised.","Inception"
"1276",6055229,6057755,"- I designed the place.No, you're with me.","Inception"
"1277",6057931,6059456,"I could do it.","Inception"
"1278",6059900,6062335,"All right. Brief him on the routeinto the complex.","Inception"
"1279",6062503,6066702,"- Fischer, you'll be going with him.- All right. What about you?","Inception"

"1281",6069877,6074007,"The windows on that upper floor are bigenough for me to cover you from that tower.","Inception"
"1282",6074181,6075479,"You're not coming in?","Inception"
"1283",6075649,6077981,"In order to find out the truthabout your father...","Inception"
"1284",6078153,6081179,"...you're gonna need to break intoBrowning's mind on your own.","Inception"

"1295",6200841,6202240,"So, what do we do?","Inception"
"1296",6202409,6203809,"We move fast.","Inception"
"1297",6209317,6211546,"Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.","Inception"
"1298",6213421,6215787,"Which gives Arthur three minutes.","Inception"
"1299",6216724,6218817,"- Hey!- That's him!","Inception"
"1300",6219493,6221222,"- Which gives us what?- Sixty minutes.","Inception"
"1301",6221395,6224661,"- Can they make that route in an hour?- They have to climb to the terrace.","Inception"
"1302",6224832,6227699,"Then they need a new route,a more direct route.","Inception"
"1303",6238912,6240539,"It's designed as a labyrinth.","Inception"
"1304",6240715,6243182,"There must be access routesthat cut through the maze.","Inception"
"1305",6243350,6244943,"Eames?","Inception"
"1306",6268042,6269304,"Did Eames add any features?","Inception"
"1307",6269476,6270944,"I don't think I should tell you.","Inception"
"1308",6271112,6273409,"We don't have time for this.Did he add anything?","Inception"
"1309",6273847,6276612,"He added an air-duct systemthat can cut through the maze.","Inception"
"1310",6276783,6277978,"Good. Explain it to them.","Inception"
"1311",6278152,6279380,"Saito?- Go ahead.","Inception"
"1312",6312720,6314278,"Paradox.","Inception"
"1313",6384158,6386216,"What was that?- The kick.","Inception"
"1314",6386828,6388728,"Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?","Inception"
"1315",6388895,6390591,"Yeah, we missed it.","Inception"
"1316",6390765,6391958,"Man.","Inception"
"1317",6392132,6396432,"Couldn't someone have dreamt upa goddamn beach? Huh?","Inception"
"1318",6396604,6397865,"Uh-huh.","Inception"
"1319",6398605,6400766,"Well, what the hell do we do now?","Inception"
"1320",6400942,6402773,"We finish the job before the next kick.","Inception"
"1321",6402944,6405037,"- What next kick?- When the van hits the water.","Inception"
"1322",6427902,6431337,"If you'd like tomake a call, please hang up and try again.","Inception"
"1323",6431506,6433337,"If you need help, hang up...","Inception"
"1324",6433573,6436872,"How do I drop you without gravity?","Inception"
"1325",6439380,6442042,"Arthur has a couple minutes,and we have about 20.","Inception"
"1326",6465472,6467134,"You okay?","Inception"
"1327",6471612,6475479,"Run! Turn around!Move to base! Move to base!","Inception"
"1328",6475649,6477173,"Go, go, go!","Inception"
"1329",6479353,6480512,"There's something wrong.","Inception"
"1330",6480688,6483020,"They're heading your way,like they know something.","Inception"
"1331",6484257,6486488,"Just buy us more time, all right?","Inception"
"1332",6486661,6488492,"- Come on!- On my way.","Inception"
"1333",6488662,6490358,"Come on! Move!","Inception"
"1334",6574548,6576073,"All right.","Inception"
"1335",6588261,6591060,"Okay. That's the antechamberoutside the strong room.","Inception"
"1336",6591231,6594724,"- Does the strong room have windows?- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.","Inception"
"1337",6594902,6597131,"Let's hope Fischer likeswhat he finds in there.","Inception"
"1338",6598773,6602105,"- Are those projections his subconscious?- Yes.","Inception"
"1339",6602275,6605643,"- Are you destroying parts of his mind?- No. They're just projections.","Inception"
"1340",6631939,6633667,"- We're here.- You're clear, but hurry.","Inception"
"1341",6633841,6635671,"There's an entire army headed your way.","Inception"
"1342",6662502,6663868,"I'm in.","Inception"
"1343",6669176,6670301,"There he is.","Inception"
"1344",6712953,6715649,"- There's someone in there.- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.","Inception"
"1345",6716823,6719384,"Come on. Come on, a little lower.","Inception"
"1346",6725131,6726292,"Cobb.","Inception"
"1347",6726934,6729458,"No, she is not real.","Inception"
"1348",6730070,6731298,"How do you know that?","Inception"
"1349",6731471,6735100,"She is just a projection.Fischer. Fischer is real.","Inception"
"1350",6739113,6740636,"Hello.","Inception"
"1351",6745319,6748515,"Eames!Eames, get to the antechamber now!","Inception"
"1352",6792432,6795300,"What happened?- Mal killed Fischer.","Inception"
"1353",6797570,6799595,"I couldn't shoot her.","Inception"
"1354",6800274,6803640,"There's no use in reviving him.His mind's already trapped down there.","Inception"
"1355",6803810,6804868,"It's all over.","Inception"
"1356",6806613,6808240,"So that's it, then? We failed?","Inception"
"1357",6808882,6811043,"We're done. I'm sorry.","Inception"
"1358",6814921,6817550,"It's not me that doesn't get backto my family, is it?","Inception"
"1359",6818259,6822161,"Shame. I wanted to know what wasgonna happen in there. I swear we had this.","Inception"
"1360",6822328,6824387,"Let's set the charges.","Inception"
"1361",6826233,6827722,"No, there's still another way.","Inception"
"1362",6829036,6832436,"- We have to follow Fischer down there.- Not enough time.","Inception"
"1363",6832605,6835439,"No, but there will be enough timedown there.","Inception"
"1364",6836577,6837668,"And we will find him.","Inception"
"1365",6837845,6841780,"Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,just use the defibrillator to revive him.","Inception"
"1366",6841948,6844850,"We can give him his own kickdown below.","Inception"
"1367",6845886,6847581,"Look, you get him in there.","Inception"
"1368",6847755,6850622,"As soon as the music ends,you blow up the hospital...","Inception"
"1369",6850791,6853588,"...and we all ride the kickback up the layers.","Inception"
"1370",6854795,6859561,"It's worth a shot, if Saito can holdthe guards off while I set the charges.","Inception"
"1371",6859733,6861826,"Saito will never make it, will he?","Inception"
"1372",6863136,6866333,"- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.- Go for it.","Inception"
"1373",6866506,6869442,"If you are not back before the kick,I am gone with or without you.","Inception"
"1374",6869609,6872841,"She's right. She's right.Come on. Let's go.","Inception"
"1375",6877083,6879279,"Can I trust you to dowhat needs to happen here?","Inception"
"1376",6879453,6880646,"Mal's gonna be down there.","Inception"
"1377",6880820,6883255,"I know where to find her.She'll have Fischer.","Inception"
"1378",6883423,6887326,"- How do you know?- Because she wants me to come after him.","Inception"
"1379",6887494,6889655,"She wants me back down there with her.","Inception"
"1380",6916422,6917447,"All right?","Inception"
"1381",6924698,6927359,"- This is your world?- It was.","Inception"
"1382",6928168,6930103,"And this is where she'll be.","Inception"
"1383",6930904,6932395,"Come on.","Inception"
"1384",6978886,6981354,"Saito. Saito.","Inception"
"1385",6981788,6985747,"I need you to take care of Fischerwhile I go set some charges, okay?","Inception"
"1386",6985926,6989362,"No room for tourists on these jobs.","Inception"
"1387",6991998,6993158,"Don't be silly.","Inception"
"1388",7025666,7027725,"You built all this? This is incredible.","Inception"
"1389",7028202,7030226,"We built for years.","Inception"
"1390",7031271,7033262,"Then we started in on the memories.","Inception"
"1391",7040314,7041712,"This way.","Inception"
"1392",7083390,7085483,"This was our neighborhood.","Inception"
"1393",7085658,7087990,"Places from our past.","Inception"
"1394",7088162,7089925,"That was our first apartment.","Inception"
"1395",7090096,7092327,"Then we moved to that buildingright there.","Inception"
"1396",7092498,7095024,"After Mal became pregnant,that became our home.","Inception"
"1397",7095202,7098000,"You reconstructed all of thisfrom memory?","Inception"
"1398",7098171,7100435,"Like I told you, we had lots of time.","Inception"
"1399",7100606,7102198,"What is that?","Inception"
"1400",7103743,7105506,"That's the house Mal grew up in.","Inception"
"1401",7105679,7108113,"- Well, will she be in there?- No.","Inception"
"1402",7108448,7109472,"Come on.","Inception"
"1403",7109649,7112983,"We both wanted to live in a house,but we loved this type of building.","Inception"
"1404",7113153,7116087,"In the real world,we'd have to choose, but not here.","Inception"
"1405",7156662,7158688,"How are we gonna bring Fischer back?","Inception"
"1406",7159099,7161533,"We're gonna have to come upwith some kind of a kick.","Inception"
"1407",7161702,7163100,"What?","Inception"
"1408",7164104,7165195,"I'm gonna improvise.","Inception"
"1409",7165372,7170036,"Listen, there's something you shouldknow about me. About inception.","Inception"
"1410",7183122,7186990,"An idea is like a virus. Resilient.","Inception"
"1411",7187828,7189386,"Highly contagious.","Inception"
"1412",7189563,7192895,"And the smallest seedof an idea can grow.","Inception"
"1413",7193966,7195935,"It can grow to define...","Inception"
"1414",7196970,7198528,"...or destroy you.","Inception"
"1415",7201675,7204439,"The smallest idea, such as:","Inception"
"1416",7205045,7207411,"""Your world is not real.""","Inception"
"1417",7207680,7211447,"Simple little thoughtthat changes everything.","Inception"
"1418",7212685,7217180,"So certain of your world. Of what's real.","Inception"
"1419",7217356,7219154,"Do you think he is?","Inception"
"1420",7220961,7223862,"Or do you think he's as lost as I was?","Inception"
"1421",7224997,7226488,"I know what's real, Mal.","Inception"
"1422",7228569,7230867,"No creeping doubts?","Inception"
"1423",7231572,7234199,"Not feeling persecuted, Dom?","Inception"
"1424",7234507,7235838,"Chased around the globe...","Inception"
"1425",7236009,7238671,"...by anonymous corporationsand police forces...","Inception"
"1426",7238845,7241474,"...the way the projectionspersecute the dreamer?","Inception"
"1427",7243082,7244573,"Admit it.","Inception"
"1428",7245886,7248719,"You don't believe in one reality anymore.","Inception"
"1429",7248889,7250412,"So choose.","Inception"
"1430",7250591,7252854,"Choose to be here.","Inception"
"1431",7253359,7254850,"Choose me.","Inception"
"1432",7280720,7281983,"You know what I have to do.","Inception"
"1433",7282154,7284817,"I have to get back to our childrenbecause you left them.","Inception"
"1434",7286158,7287682,"Because you left us.","Inception"
"1435",7287860,7289658,"- You're wrong.I'm not wrong.","Inception"
"1436",7289829,7291854,"You're confused.","Inception"
"1437",7292966,7295024,"Our children are here.","Inception"
"1438",7295801,7299067,"And you'd like to see their faces again,wouldn't you?","Inception"
"1439",7299238,7302298,"Yes, but I'm gonna see themup above, Mal.","Inception"
"1440",7315956,7317947,"Up above?","Inception"
"1441",7318859,7322488,"Listen to yourself.These are our children.","Inception"
"1442",7323029,7324395,"Watch.","Inception"
"1443",7324898,7326592,"James? Phillipa?","Inception"
"1444",7326766,7329201,"Don't do this, Mal. Please.Those aren't my children.","Inception"
"1445",7329368,7331837,"You keep telling yourself that,but you don't believe it.","Inception"
"1446",7332005,7333904,"- No, I know it.- What if you're wrong?","Inception"
"1447",7334307,7336605,"What if I'm what's real?","Inception"
"1448",7337810,7340041,"You keep telling yourself what you know.","Inception"
"1449",7341614,7343845,"But what do you believe?","Inception"
"1450",7344818,7346046,"What do you feel?","Inception"
"1451",7348188,7349621,"Guilt.","Inception"
"1452",7350823,7353054,"I feel guilt, Mal.","Inception"
"1453",7353594,7357529,"And no matter what I do,no matter how hopeless I am...","Inception"
"1454",7357698,7361963,"...no matter how confused,that guilt is always there...","Inception"
"1455",7362135,7364659,"...reminding me of the truth.","Inception"
"1456",7365171,7366469,"What truth?","Inception"
"1457",7368908,7374141,"That the idea that caused you to questionyour reality came from me.","Inception"
"1458",7377516,7380645,"You planted the idea in my mind?","Inception"
"1459",7382154,7383645,"What is she talking about?","Inception"
"1460",7384557,7389824,"The reason I knew inception was possiblewas because I did it to her first.","Inception"
"1461",7390863,7393832,"- I did it to my own wife.- Why?","Inception"
"1462",7394568,7396057,"We were lost in here.","Inception"
"1463",7397003,7401634,"I knew we needed to escape,but she wouldn't accept it.","Inception"
"1464",7404845,7410511,"She had locked something away,something deep inside.","Inception"
"1465",7411283,7415413,"A truth that she had once known,but chose to forget.","Inception"
"1466",7416390,7418516,"And she couldn't break free.","Inception"
"1467",7421228,7423957,"So I decided to search for it.","Inception"
"1468",7424530,7429399,"I went deep into the recess of her mindand found that secret place.","Inception"
"1469",7429569,7431469,"And I broke in...","Inception"
"1470",7432038,7434199,"...and I planted an idea.","Inception"
"1471",7434940,7438707,"A simple little ideathat would change everything.","Inception"
"1472",7443949,7446315,"That her world wasn't real.","Inception"
"1473",7459131,7462328,"That death was the only escape.","Inception"
"1474",7469743,7471506,"You're waiting for a train.","Inception"
"1475",7473814,7476543,"A train that'll take you far away.","Inception"
"1476",7477717,7480710,"You know where you hopethis train will take you...","Inception"
"1477",7481822,7483846,"...but you can't know for sure.","Inception"
"1478",7485024,7486548,"Yet it doesn't matter.","Inception"
"1479",7487993,7491157,"- Now, tell me why!- Because you'll be together!","Inception"
"1480",7495502,7499563,"But I never knew that that ideawould grow in her mind like a cancer...","Inception"
"1481",7499739,7502140,"...that even after she woke...","Inception"
"1482",7505045,7507512,"That even afteryou came back to reality...","Inception"
"1483",7510449,7513418,"...that you'd continue to believeyour world wasn't real.","Inception"
"1484",7516189,7518588,"That death was the only escape.","Inception"
"1485",7518759,7521421,"Mal, no! Jesus!","Inception"
"1486",7521595,7525292,"- You infected my mind.- I was trying to save you.","Inception"
"1487",7525465,7526863,"You betrayed me.","Inception"
"1488",7527701,7531398,"But you can make amends.You can still keep your promise.","Inception"
"1489",7531570,7534596,"We can still be together, right here...","Inception"
"1490",7534774,7537243,"...in the world we built together.","Inception"
"1491",7618057,7620390,"Cobb, we need to get Fischer.","Inception"
"1492",7621261,7622557,"You can't have him.","Inception"
"1493",7623596,7627033,"- If I stay here, will you let him go?- What are you talking about?","Inception"
"1494",7631503,7633335,"Fischer is on the porch.","Inception"
"1495",7633907,7636501,"- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.- Cobb, you can't do this.","Inception"
"1496",7636676,7639304,"Go check he's alive right now. Do it.","Inception"
"1497",7654961,7658055,"He's here! And it's time,but you have to come now!","Inception"
"1498",7658230,7661894,"You take Fischer with you, all right?- You can't stay here to be with her.","Inception"
"1499",7664470,7667167,"I'm not. Saito's dead by now.","Inception"
"1500",7667340,7670832,"That means he's down here somewhere.That means I have to find him.","Inception"
"1501",7672845,7675939,"I can't stay with her anymore,because she doesn't exist.","Inception"
"1502",7676115,7679516,"I'm the only thingyou do believe in anymore.","Inception"
"1503",7679685,7681016,"No.","Inception"
"1504",7682188,7683621,"I wish.","Inception"
"1505",7685225,7687716,"I wish more than anything, but...","Inception"
"1506",7688828,7691557,"...I can't imagine youwith all your complexity...","Inception"
"1507",7691730,7694256,"...all your perfection,all your imperfection.","Inception"
"1508",7695368,7696391,"- You all right?- Yeah.","Inception"
"1509",7696569,7698399,"Look at you.","Inception"
"1510",7699639,7704576,"You're just a shade.You're just a shade of my real wife.","Inception"

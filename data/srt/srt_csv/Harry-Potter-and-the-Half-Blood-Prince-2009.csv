"1142",6498020,6504692,"And your human friends find solacein the loss they have sustained.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1143",6519915,6523460,"I had him from an egg, you know.Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1144",6523668,6527318,"No bigger than a Pekinese.A Pekinese, mind you.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1145",6527526,6532739,"How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.He was very dear to me.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1146",6532844,6538057,"One afternoon I came downstairs,and he'd vanished.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1147",6538265,6539829,"Poof.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1148",6539934,6543166,"- That's very odd, isn't it?- It is, isn't it?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1149",6543374,6547023,"But that's life, I suppose.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1150",6547232,6552549,"You go along and then suddenly, poof!","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1151",6552758,6556407,"- Poof.- Poof.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1152",6571004,6574028,"It was a student who gave me Francis.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1153",6575070,6579345,"One spring afternoonI discovered a bowl on my desk...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1154",6580284,6583203,"...with just a few inchesof clear water in it.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1155",6584037,6587582,"And floating on the surfacewas a flower petal.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1156",6589146,6591544,"As I watched, it sank.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1157",6593108,6595923,"Just before it reached the bottom...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1158",6596132,6597591,"...it transformed...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1159",6598947,6600719,"...into a wee fish.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1160",6602492,6604577,"It was beautiful magic.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1161",6605620,6607809,"Wondrous to behold.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1162",6610416,6613231,"The flower petal had come from a lily.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1163",6615629,6616567,"Your mother.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1164",6618653,6621155,"The day I came downstairs...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1165",6622093,6624387,"...the day the bowl was empty...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1166",6625951,6628141,"...was the day your mother...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1167",6632103,6634084,"I know why you're here.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1168",6637107,6639088,"But I can't help you.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1169",6640965,6642633,"It would ruin me.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1170",6646387,6648785,"Do you know why I survived, professor?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1171",6649410,6651183,"The night I got this?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1172",6652955,6654519,"Because of her.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1173",6655458,6657230,"Because she sacrificed herself.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1174",6657751,6660045,"Because she refused to step aside.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1175",6660254,6663486,"Because her love was more powerfulthan Voldemort.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1176",6663590,6667344,"- Don't say his name.- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1177",6668178,6670263,"I'm going to tell you something.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1178",6671201,6674121,"Something others have only guessed at.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1179",6676102,6677666,"It's true.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1180",6678187,6679543,"I am the Chosen One.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1181",6680481,6682670,"Only I can destroy him,but in order to do so...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1182",6682879,6686215,"...I need to know what Tom Riddleasked you years ago in your office...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1183",6686320,6688718,"...and I need to know what you told him.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1184",6689448,6691846,"Be brave, professor.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1185",6693514,6695599,"Be brave like my mother.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1186",6696850,6699561,"Otherwise, you disgrace her.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1187",6700708,6702898,"Otherwise, she died for nothing.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1188",6703940,6709153,"Otherwise, the bowlwill remain empty forever.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1189",6719684,6722812,"Please, don't think badly of mewhen you see it.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1190",6724897,6728129,"You've no idea what he was like,even then.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1191",6764934,6767541,"I was in the library the other night...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1192",6767750,6769939,"...in the Restricted Section...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1193",6770773,6774422,"...and I read something rather oddabout a bit of rare magic.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1194",6775778,6778489,"It's called, as I understand it...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1195",6779740,6781095,"...a Horcrux.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1196",6782972,6785683,"- I beg your pardon?- Horcrux.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1197",6786100,6788811,"I came across the term while reading...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1198",6788915,6791939,"...and I didn't fully understand it.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1199",6792147,6793816,"I'm not sure what youwere reading, Tom...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1200",6794024,6796631,"...but this is very dark stuff,very dark indeed.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1201",6796839,6798299,"Which is...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1202",6799446,6801322,"...why I came to you.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1203",6804138,6809768,"A Horcrux is an object in which a personhas concealed part of their soul.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1204",6809976,6812583,"But I don't understandhow that works, sir.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1205",6815190,6819152,"One splits one's soul and hidespart of it in an object.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1206",6819360,6822905,"By doing so, you're protected, shouldyou be attacked and your body destroyed.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1207",6823114,6824260,"Protected?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1208",6824365,6827597,"That part of your soulthat is hidden lives on.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1209",6829057,6831455,"In other words, you cannot die.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1210",6838649,6841777,"And how does one split his soul, sir?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1211",6841985,6844800,"I think you already knowthe answer to that, Tom.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1212",6846052,6847511,"Murder.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1213",6848033,6849284,"Yes.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1214",6849909,6854810,"Killing rips the soul apart.It is a violation against nature.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1215",6855644,6860440,"Can you only split the soulonce? For instance, isn't seven...?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1216",6860649,6862108,"Seven?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1217",6862838,6868155,"Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enoughto consider killing one person?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1218",6868364,6872013,"To rip the soul into seven pieces...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1219",6873264,6876288,"This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?All academic?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1220",6881084,6882335,"Of course, sir.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1221",6885359,6887340,"It'll be our little secret.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1222",6896098,6897349,"Sir.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1223",6912780,6914866,"This is beyond anything I imagined.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1224",6915074,6917785,"You mean to say he succeeded, sir,in making a Horcrux?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1225",6917889,6921017,"Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.And not just once.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1226",6921226,6922268,"What are they exactly?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1227",6922373,6925709,"Could be anything.Most commonplace of objects.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1228",6928941,6930609,"A ring, for example.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1229",6931235,6932695,"Or a book.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1230",6934050,6936448,"- Tom Riddle's diary.- It's a Horcrux, yes.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1231",6936969,6939055,"Four years ago, when you savedGinny's life...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1232",6939263,6941453,"...in the Chamber of Secrets,you brought me this.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1233",6941661,6943538,"I knew this wasa different kind of magic.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1234",6943747,6948751,"Very dark, very powerful. But until tonightI had no idea just how powerful.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1235",6948960,6950941,"- The ring?- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1236",6951358,6956050,"Difficult to find.Even more difficult to destroy.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1237",6956258,6960116,"But if you could find them all,if you did destroy each Horcrux...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1238",6960325,6961471,"One destroys Voldemort.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1239",6961576,6964495,"But how would you find them?They could be hidden anywhere.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1240",6964704,6967936,"True. But magic, especially dark magic...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1241",6981907,6983784,"...leaves traces.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1242",6991604,6993689,"It's where you've been going,isn't it, sir?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1243",6993897,6996087,"- When you leave the school?- Yes.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1244",6997025,7000049,"And I think perhapsI may have found another.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1245",7000258,7004324,"But this time,I cannot hope to destroy it alone.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1246",7005888,7010475,"Once again,I must ask too much of you, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1247",7014542,7016731,"Have you ever consideredthat you ask too much...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1248",7016940,7019546,"...that you take too much for granted?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1249",7019755,7024759,"Has it ever crossed your brilliant mindthat I don't want to do this anymore?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1250",7024968,7027053,"Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1251",7027992,7033726,"I will not negotiate with you, Severus.You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1252",7052181,7053745,"Oh, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1253",7056351,7058645,"You need a shave, my friend.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1254",7061460,7065735,"You know, at times,I forget how much you've grown.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1255",7065839,7069801,"At times, I still see the small boyfrom the cupboard.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1256",7071365,7073763,"Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1257",7074180,7075744,"I'm an old man.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1258",7075849,7077517,"You still look the same to me, sir.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1259",7078977,7082000,"Just like your mother,you're unfailingly kind.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1260",7082209,7085337,"A trait people never fail to undervalue,I'm afraid.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1261",7088152,7092635,"The place to which we journey tonightis extremely dangerous.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1262",7092844,7096284,"I promised you could accompany me,and I stand by that promise.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1263",7096493,7098265,"But there is one condition:","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1264",7098474,7101706,"You must obey every commandI give you, without question.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1265",7102540,7104208,"Yes, sir.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1266",7104417,7106502,"You do understand what I'm saying?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1267",7107128,7109526,"Should I tell you to hide, you hide.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1268",7109734,7112028,"Should I tell you to run, you run.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1269",7112237,7116199,"Should I tell you to abandon meand save yourself, you must do so.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1270",7121412,7122976,"Your word, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1271",7124644,7126104,"My word.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1272",7126938,7128606,"Take my arm.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1273",7130066,7132464,"Sir, I thought you couldn'tApparate within Hogwarts.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1274",7133089,7136530,"Well, being me has its privileges.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1275",7183866,7185430,"This is the place.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1276",7186264,7187828,"Oh, yes.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1277",7188766,7191269,"This place has known magic.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1278",7199297,7200861,"- Sir!- In order to gain passage...","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1279",7201069,7202425,"...payment must be made.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1280",7202633,7206282,"Payment intendedto weaken any intruder.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1281",7207846,7209619,"- You should've let me, sir.- No, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1282",7210140,7212851,"Your blood's much more preciousthan mine.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1283",7234746,7239334,"Voldemort will not have made it easyto discover his hiding place.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1284",7239543,7242879,"He will have put certain defensesin position.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1285",7245486,7246841,"Careful.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1286",7270405,7271552,"There it is.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1287",7273011,7275722,"The only question is,how do we get there?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1288",7297930,7299703,"If you would, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1289",7347038,7349436,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1290",7350062,7351418,"Oh, yes.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1291",7362574,7364138,"It has to be drunk.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1292",7364346,7367161,"All of it has to be drunk.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1293",7367995,7371332,"You remember the conditions on whichI brought you with me?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1294",7371540,7373938,"This potion might paralyze me.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1295",7374356,7376024,"Might make me forget why I'm here.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1296",7376754,7380090,"Might cause me so much painthat I beg for relief.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1297",7380299,7382280,"You are not to indulge these requests.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1298",7382384,7385929,"It's your job, Harry, to make sureI keep drinking this potion.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1299",7386137,7388535,"Even if you have to force itdown my throat.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1300",7389057,7391142,"- Understood?- Why can't I drink it, sir?","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1301",7391350,7396772,"Because I am much older, much cleverer,and much less valuable.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
"1302",7400734,7402715,"Your good health, Harry.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"

"421",1546628,1548128,"Not at all.","Airport"
"422",1548213,1549631,"Now look, Mrs. Quonsett,","Airport"
"423",1550465,1553259,"since you've had so much free travel from Trans Global","Airport"
"424",1553344,1556095,"the least you could do is tell ushow you get aboard our flights.","Airport"
"425",1556971,1559182,"Well, my dear,I use many methods.","Airport"
"426",1559266,1563060,"But mostly, I like to be in the airportearly enough to get me a boarding pass.","Airport"
"427",1563479,1565395,"But our boarding passesare ticket folders.","Airport"
"428",1565480,1566855,"Yes, I know.","Airport"
"429",1566941,1569400,"I go to a counter andtell them I've lost mine","Airport"
"430",1569484,1571193,"and may I pleasehave another one.","Airport"
"431",1571278,1573195,"I always pick a counterwhere the clerks are busy","Airport"
"432",1573279,1574321,"and lots of peopleare waiting.","Airport"
"433",1574405,1575656,"They always give me one.","Airport"
"434",1577826,1579493,"But it's justa blank folder.","Airport"
"435",1579577,1581371,"It isn't made outas a gate pass.","Airport"
"436",1581454,1583705,"I do that myselfin the ladies' room.","Airport"
"437",1584583,1586875,"I know from experiencejust what to write.","Airport"
"438",1586961,1590755,"I carry one of these big black pencilslike the airlines use in my purse.","Airport"

"440",1592048,1593840,"I'll keep that,if you don't mind.","Airport"
"441",1593925,1595425,"Well, it's really mine.","Airport"
"442",1596095,1598930,"But if you want it,I suppose I can get another one.","Airport"
"443",1599807,1602808,"So now you have a boarding pass, Mrs.Quonsett. What then?","Airport"
"444",1602893,1605103,"Well, then I go tothe departure gate.","Airport"
"445",1605186,1606938,"Coffee?No, thank you.","Airport"
"446",1607021,1609440,"I wait till the young man checking tickets there is busy","Airport"
"447",1609525,1611442,"and then I walk past himand onto the plane.","Airport"
"448",1612193,1614069,"Do you hear that,Mr. Coakley?","Airport"
"449",1614697,1616780,"And no one stops you,not even the stewardesses?","Airport"
"450",1617031,1619992,"lf you get on late enough,they're hanging up coats, you know","Airport"
"451",1620076,1621827,"and talking to the men.","Airport"
"452",1621912,1625832,"I just show them my folder quickly,you see.","Airport"
"453",1626916,1628417,"I'll keep that, too.","Airport"
"454",1629169,1632171,"But I'm sure you don't always use a boarding pass.","Airport"
"455",1632256,1633423,"No.","Airport"
"456",1634048,1638135,"Sometimes I tell them that my son hasgone aboard but he dropped his wallet.","Airport"
"457",1638220,1641931,"I carry a man'swallet in my hand...","Airport"
"458",1644183,1645601,"That works best of all.","Airport"

"1525",5569814,5571899,"Three, four, five.Depends on the size of the hole.","Airport"
"1526",5571983,5574652,"Everything fogs up just like that.And then watch out.","Airport"
"1527",5575612,5576862,"At that altitudeyou can't breathe,","Airport"

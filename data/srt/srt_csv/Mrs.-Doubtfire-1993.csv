"875",4349456,4352220,"Miranda. What are you home early for, dear?","Mrs. Doubtfire"

"878",4358165,4360633,"- I can't believe it.- What, dear?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"879",4361235,4365467,"She says Daniel has some womanliving with him pretending to be his sister!","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"880",4366774,4372644,"- I told her he doesn't even have a sister.- Mrs Sellner's probably mistaken.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"881",4372780,4376238,"She's a social worker, dear. Really!","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"882",4376383,4379978,"And besides, how could he replace you?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"883",4380087,4382612,"And so quickly. Really!","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"884",4382723,4386159,"She's supposed to be olderand very unattractive.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"885",4387861,4389886,"Really?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"886",4390731,4392790,"Mrs Doubtfire.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"887",4394435,4397495,"- Yes?- Did you and Mr Doubtfire ever...","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"888",4398472,4404308,"- You must have had your share of problems.- Oh, of course, dear. What marriage doesn't?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"889",4404445,4408108,"But I always say: The bad times fade away,","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"890",4408248,4411274,"and the good onesadhere themselves to your memory.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"891",4411418,4414080,"- Yes. Excuse me.- That's all right.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"892",4417224,4421786,"As I hold this cold meat,I'm reminded of Winston. God rest his soul.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"893",4422529,4424463,"When did he... pass on?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"894",4426100,4429331,"Eight years ago, dear. This November.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"895",4429637,4431696,"What happened?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"896",4431839,4434535,"- He was quite fond of the drink.- Ah.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"897",4435442,4438002,"- It was the drink that killed him.- How awful.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"898",4438112,4442276,"- He was an alcoholic?- No. He was hit by a Guinness truck.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"899",4442383,4445352,"So it was quite literallythe drink that killed him.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"900",4445519,4448010,"- How tragic!- Yes.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"901",4452559,4455460,"Oh, but he was a good man, though, really.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"902",4456997,4459431,"A sainted man.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"903",4459533,4462229,"And despite his mountains of faults, dear,","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"904",4462336,4465703,"I always say: A flawed husbandis better than none at all.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"905",4466907,4471310,"- Who needs a husband when I've got you?- Surely you don't mean that, dear?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"906",4471412,4473846,"- Well...- Oh, that's so sweet!","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"907",4473947,4477713,"You can't imagine what it was likebeing married to Daniel.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"908",4477818,4482585,"Tell me, dear. What was so horribleabout this man you lived with for 14 years?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"909",4482723,4484782,"Well, at first, nothing.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"910",4484925,4487985,"He was so... romantic.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"911",4488128,4490153,"- So passionate.- Really?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"912",4490297,4493164,"He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"913",4493300,4497134,"I hope you don't mind mebeing a tad rude, but...","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"914",4497237,4501196,"How was he... you know...on a scale of 1 to 10?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"915",4501341,4504674,"Oh, well. That part was always...","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"916",4505412,4507073,"OK.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"917",4507181,4509411,"Just OK?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"918",4510017,4513953,"He was probably a Casanovacompared to poor old Winston.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"919",4514054,4516545,"- What was the matter with Winston?- Oh, dear.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"920",4516657,4520991,"Winston's idea of foreplay was""Effie, brace yourself.""","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"921",4524131,4527328,"It was Daniel's spontaneity and energyI fell in love with.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"922",4527434,4529299,"Really?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"923",4529403,4533965,"Everyone else I knewwas so organized, so scheduled.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"924",4534074,4536133,"Like me, I guess.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"925",4536243,4541203,"But Daniel was so wonderfully different.And funny. He could always make me laugh.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"926",4541348,4544545,"I always say:The key to a solid marriage is laughter.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"927",4545886,4549583,"But after a few years,everything just stopped being funny.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"928",4549690,4553387,"- Why?- I was working all the time.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"929",4553494,4557658,"And he was always between jobs.I hardly ever got to see the kids.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"930",4557798,4561666,"If I got home early to be with them,something would go wrong.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"931",4561802,4565203,"The house would be wreckedand I'd have to clean it up.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"932",4566573,4571237,"He never knew, but so many nights I just...cried myself to sleep.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"933",4573080,4574945,"Really?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"934",4576917,4580580,"The truth is, I didn't like who I waswhen I was with him.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"935",4581388,4583618,"I would turn into this horrible person.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"936",4584691,4588457,"I didn't want my kids growing upwith a mother like that.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"937",4589830,4592298,"When I'm not with Daniel, I'm better.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"938",4593433,4598029,"And... I'm sure he's betterwhen he's not with me.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"939",4599273,4601764,"Well, you never...","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"940",4601875,4606209,"I mean... Did you eversay anything to him, dear?","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"941",4608448,4611508,"Daniel never likedto talk about anything serious.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"942",4617558,4621688,"I used to think Daniel could do anything.Except be serious.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"943",4624331,4628062,"But then, I was serious enoughfor everybody.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"944",4650390,4654827,"- This is great!- Isn't this posh!","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"945",4654928,4660457,"I'll bet it's very exclusive. Probably needa credit reference just to get in the pool.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"946",4660567,4663229,"- Amazing!- Oh, Nattie.","Mrs. Doubtfire"

"1310",6412117,6417077,"Your Honor, in the past two months,I've secured a residence, refurbished it","Mrs. Doubtfire"

"1313",6427132,6429191,"Ahead of schedule.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1314",6430335,6432735,"In regards to my behavior,","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1315",6432871,6434896,"I can only plead insanity.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1316",6435040,6437634,"Because, ever since my children were born,","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1317",6437743,6441008,"the moment I looked at them,I was crazy about them.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1318",6441113,6443604,"Once I held them, I was hooked.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1319",6445050,6447075,"I'm addicted to my children, sir.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1320",6447986,6450045,"I love them with all my heart.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1321",6450155,6455252,"And the idea of someone telling me I can'tbe with them, I can't see them every day...","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1322",6455360,6458056,"It's like someone saying I can't have air.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1323",6458163,6461690,"I can't live without air,and I can't live without them.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1324",6462167,6467833,"Listen, I would do anything. I just wantto be with them. I know I need that, sir.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1325",6468206,6470697,"We have a history.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1326",6471677,6476876,"And I just... They mean everything to me.And they need me as much as I need them.","Mrs. Doubtfire"

"1330",6500372,6502397,"Mr Hillard...","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1331",6502541,6507774,"You've been able to fool a lot of people intobelieving that you're a 60-year-old woman.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1332",6508547,6510572,"No easy task.","Mrs. Doubtfire"

"1335",6525997,6529433,"- No. It's not that.- The reality, Mr Hillard,","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1336",6530068,6534971,"is that your lifestyle over the past monthhas been very unorthodox.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1337",6535474,6539103,"And I refuse to further subjectthree innocent children","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1338",6539211,6543443,"to your peculiarand potentially harmful behavior.","Mrs. Doubtfire"
"1339",6543582,6547245,"It is this court's decisionto award full custody to Mrs Hillard.","Mrs. Doubtfire"

in the tunnel and then seal that door?","Aliens"
"929",5351470,5354472,"Yeah, that'll work,but we gotta figure on them
getting into the complex.","Aliens"
"930",5354557,5359561,"That's right,so we repair the barricades
at these two intersections.","Aliens"
"931",5359688,5362355,"Right.And weld plate steel

"998",5687974,5690057,"Let's go through it again.","Aliens"
"999",5690143,5692351,"They grab the colonists,they move them over there...","Aliens"
"1000",5692436,5696773,"and they immobilize themto be hosts for more of these.","Aliens"
"1001",5696858,5700694,"Which would mean thatthere would have to be
a lot of these parasites, right?","Aliens"
"1002",5700778,5702945,"One for each colonist.That's over 100, at least.","Aliens"
"1003",5703030,5704948,"Yes. Τhat follows.","Aliens"
"1004",5705033,5709077,"But each one of these thingscomes from an egg, right?","Aliens"

"1006",5713625,5716710,"I'm not sure.","Aliens"
"1007",5716793,5718753,"It must be somethingwe haven't seen yet.","Aliens"
"1008",5718837,5721047,"Hey, maybe it's likean ant hive.","Aliens"
"1009",5721131,5723175,"Bees, man.Bees have hives.","Aliens"
"1010",5723259,5728387,"You know what I mean.There's, like, one female

I know that.","Aliens"
"1014",5736064,5740734,"Bishop, I want these specimensdestroyed as soon as
you're finished with them.","Aliens"
"1015",5740818,5743737,"- Is that clear?- Mr. Burke gave instructions...","Aliens"
"1016",5743820,5747658,"that they were to be kept alivein stasis for return
to the company labs.","Aliens"
"1017",5749868,5751828,"He was very specificabout it.","Aliens"
"1018",5753247,5757250,"Look. Those two specimensare worth millions
to the bio-weapons division, right?","Aliens"
"1019",5757335,5760712,"Now, if you're smart,we can both come out
of this heroes,","Aliens"
"1020",5760796,5764006,"and we will beset up for life.","Aliens"
"1021",5765051,5767636,"You're crazy, Burke.Do you know that?","Aliens"
"1022",5767720,5771890,"Do you really think you can geta dangerous organism like that
past I.C.C. quarantine?","Aliens"
"1023",5771974,5774850,"How can they impound itif they don't
know about it?","Aliens"
"1024",5774935,5777979,"But they will know about it,Burke, from me.","Aliens"
"1025",5778064,5782274,"Just like they'll knowthat you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.","Aliens"
"1026",5782402,5784819,"Wait a second.You sent them
to that ship.","Aliens"
"1027",5784945,5787029,"You're wrong.I just checked
the colony log.","Aliens"
"1028",5787114,5790992,"Directive dated 6-1 2-79,signed Burke, Carter J.","Aliens"
"1029",5791077,5793994,"You sent them out there,and you didn't even warn them.","Aliens"
"1030",5794122,5796539,"Why didn't youwarn them, Burke?
Okay, look.","Aliens"
"1031",5796623,5799126,"What if that shipdidn't even exist?
Do you ever think about that?","Aliens"
"1032",5799210,5802878,"I didn't know. So nowif I went and made a major
security situation out of it,","Aliens"
"1033",5803005,5806382,"everybody steps in,administration steps in, and
there's no exclusive rights for anybody.","Aliens"
"1034",5806466,5810511,"Nobody wins.So I made a decision,
and it was wrong.","Aliens"
"1035",5810595,5813305,"It was a bad call, Ripley.It was a bad call.","Aliens"
"1036",5813432,5815100,"Bad call?Right.","Aliens"
"1037",5815184,5816810,"These peopleare dead, Burke!","Aliens"

"242",1037119,1039413,"This happened about 1:30 when that thing...","Interstellar"
"243",1039748,1041500,"came off the top of that canyon.","Interstellar"
"244",1043210,1045336,"In my day, we had real ballplayers.","Interstellar"

"247",1050299,1052344,"fighting over foodto even play baseball.","Interstellar"
"248",1052635,1057516,"Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.I want a hot dog.","Interstellar"

"250",1060560,1062061,"I think that's great.","Interstellar"
"251",1062354,1065648,"- You think that's great?- You hate farming, Dad.","Interstellar"
"252",1066441,1068067,"Grandpa said.","Interstellar"
"253",1068234,1069653,"Grandpa said, huh?","Interstellar"
"254",1070069,1072614,"Listen, all that mattersis how you feel about it.","Interstellar"

"267",1255212,1256882,"It's not a ghost.","Interstellar"
"268",1262304,1263721,"It's gravity.","Interstellar"
"269",1265473,1267726,"I'm dropping Torn, then heading to town.","Interstellar"
"270",1268018,1272189,"You want to clean that upwhen you've finished praying to it?","Interstellar"
"271",1297547,1299799,"It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.","Interstellar"

"299",1506338,1507673,"Where's my daughter?","Interstellar"
"300",1507965,1511885,"You had the coordinates for this facilitymarked on your map. Where did you get them?","Interstellar"

"302",1513555,1516473,"Don't make me take you down again.Sit down!","Interstellar"
"303",1516807,1519019,"Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?","Interstellar"
"304",1519184,1521770,"Marines don't exist anymore.","Interstellar"
"305",1522063,1524574,"And I got grunts likeyou mowing my grass.","Interstellar"
"306",1524599,1527051,"Where did you findthose coordinates?","Interstellar"
"307",1527192,1529778,"But you don't look much like a lawnmower.","Interstellar"
"308",1529945,1532781,"Think I'll turn youinto an overqualified vacuum cleaner.","Interstellar"
"309",1532949,1534159,"No, you won't.","Interstellar"
"310",1535785,1537703,"TARS, back down, please.","Interstellar"
"311",1539204,1542333,"You know, you're taking a riskusing ex-military security.","Interstellar"
"312",1542791,1546628,"They're old, and their control unitsare unpredictable.","Interstellar"
"313",1546796,1548798,"It's what the government could spare.","Interstellar"
"314",1550467,1551634,"Who are you?","Interstellar"
"315",1552093,1553427,"Dr. Brand.","Interstellar"
"316",1553595,1555971,"I knew a Dr. Brand once.He was a professor.","Interstellar"
"317",1556346,1557848,"What makes you think I'm not?","Interstellar"
"318",1558307,1560643,"Wasn't near as cute, either.","Interstellar"
"319",1560977,1563480,"Please, Dr. Brand.I don't have any idea what this is.","Interstellar"
"320",1564314,1566816,"Now I'm scared for my daughterand want her by my side.","Interstellar"
"321",1566982,1569443,"You give me that,I'll tell you anything you want to know.","Interstellar"
"322",1572821,1575825,"Get the principals and the girlin the conference room, please.","Interstellar"
"323",1577160,1578536,"Your daughter is fine.","Interstellar"
"324",1578994,1580038,"Bright kid.","Interstellar"
"325",1580622,1582457,"Must have a very smart mother.","Interstellar"
"326",1582624,1585042,"It's pretty clear youdon't want any visitors.","Interstellar"
"327",1585210,1589172,"So why don't you just let us back up fromyour fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?","Interstellar"
"328",1589463,1592008,"- It's not that simple.- Well, sure, it is.","Interstellar"
"329",1592342,1596011,"I don't know anything about you.I don't know anything about this place.","Interstellar"
"330",1596887,1598056,"Yes, you do.","Interstellar"
"331",1603769,1604854,"Dad!","Interstellar"
"332",1607523,1608566,"Hello, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"333",1610026,1611068,"Professor Brand.","Interstellar"
"334",1613238,1615198,"Explain to me how you found this facility.","Interstellar"
"335",1615365,1618660,"Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbledupon it. We were on a salvage run...","Interstellar"
"336",1618826,1621538,"You're sitting in the best-kept secretin the world.","Interstellar"
"337",1621703,1625208,"Nobody stumbles in here.Nobody stumbles out.","Interstellar"
"338",1625541,1627210,"Cooper, please.","Interstellar"
"339",1627669,1629753,"Cooperate with these people.","Interstellar"
"340",1629921,1631131,"Look.","Interstellar"
"341",1632048,1633715,"It's kind of hard to explain.","Interstellar"
"342",1634049,1638221,"We learned these coordinatesfrom an anomaly.","Interstellar"
"343",1638971,1640306,"What sort of anomaly?","Interstellar"
"344",1640472,1643768,"I hesitate to term it supernatural,but it definitely wasn't scientific.","Interstellar"
"345",1643934,1647855,"You're going to have to be specific,Mr. Cooper. Right now.","Interstellar"
"346",1648021,1649273,"It was gravity.","Interstellar"
"347",1652943,1657156,"Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?Where was this?","Interstellar"
"348",1657323,1660617,"Now, I'm real happy that you're excitedabout gravity, bud...","Interstellar"
"349",1660785,1663997,"but you're not getting any answersfrom us until I get assurances.","Interstellar"
"350",1664163,1665455,"- Assurances?- Yeah.","Interstellar"
"351",1666290,1669751,"Like, that we're getting out of here.And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.","Interstellar"
"352",1672297,1674423,"Don't you know who we are, Coop?","Interstellar"
"353",1674590,1675842,"No, professor, I don't.","Interstellar"
"354",1676009,1678010,"You know my father, Professor Brand.","Interstellar"
"355",1678635,1679929,"We're NASA.","Interstellar"
"356",1681722,1683932,"- NASA?- NASA.","Interstellar"
"357",1684267,1686059,"The same NASA you flew for.","Interstellar"
"358",1697113,1698780,"I heard they shut you down, sir...","Interstellar"
"359",1698948,1701241,"for refusing to drop bombsfrom the stratosphere...","Interstellar"
"360",1701409,1702951,"onto starving people.","Interstellar"
"361",1703118,1705454,"When they realizedthat killing other people was...","Interstellar"
"362",1705622,1708458,"not a long-term solution,then they needed us back.","Interstellar"
"363",1708625,1710626,"- In secret.- Why secret?","Interstellar"
"364",1710792,1714631,"Because public opinion wouldn'tallow spending on space exploration.","Interstellar"
"365",1715088,1717383,"Not while you're strugglingto put food on the table.","Interstellar"
"366",1718800,1719969,"Blight.","Interstellar"
"367",1720427,1724265,"Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.","Interstellar"
"368",1725016,1726683,"Now there's just corn.","Interstellar"
"369",1727018,1728978,"And we're growing more than we ever have.","Interstellar"
"370",1729144,1733316,"But like the potatoes in Irelandand the wheat in the Dust Bowl...","Interstellar"
"371",1733900,1736402,"the corn will die.","Interstellar"
"372",1737153,1738195,"Soon.","Interstellar"
"373",1743492,1747079,"We'll find a way, professor.We always have.","Interstellar"
"374",1747829,1751834,"Driven by the unshakable faiththe Earth is ours.","Interstellar"
"375",1752335,1754211,"Not just ours, no.","Interstellar"
"376",1755003,1756338,"But it is our home.","Interstellar"
"377",1757673,1761009,"Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.","Interstellar"
"378",1761176,1762886,"We don't even breathe nitrogen.","Interstellar"
"379",1763054,1768393,"Blight does. And as it thrives,our air gets less and less oxygen.","Interstellar"
"380",1768558,1772020,"The last people to starvewill be the first to suffocate.","Interstellar"
"381",1772188,1774356,"And your daughter's generation...","Interstellar"
"382",1776025,1778278,"will be the last to survive on Earth.","Interstellar"
"383",1778443,1782030,"Murph is tired. I was wonderingif she could take a nap in my office.","Interstellar"
"384",1782531,1784032,"Yeah. Thank you.","Interstellar"
"385",1786827,1787869,"ORGY......","Interstellar"
"386",1788871,1792375,"now you need to tell mewhat your plan is to save the world.","Interstellar"
"387",1793041,1796546,"We're not meant to save the world.We're meant to leave it.","Interstellar"
"388",1802384,1803428,"Rangers.","Interstellar"
"389",1803720,1808682,"The last components of our one versatileship in orbit, the Endurance.","Interstellar"
"390",1808974,1810601,"Our final expedition.","Interstellar"
"391",1811394,1814355,"You sent people out therelooking for a new home?","Interstellar"
"392",1814980,1816273,"The Lazarus missions.","Interstellar"
"393",1816606,1819568,"- Oh, that sounds cheerful.- Lazarus came back from the dead.","Interstellar"
"394",1819902,1821903,"Sure, but he had to die in the first place.","Interstellar"
"395",1822529,1825240,"There's not a planet in our solar systemthat could sustain life...","Interstellar"
"396",1825407,1827910,"and the nearest star'sover a thousand years away.","Interstellar"
"397",1828076,1830747,"That doesn't even qualify as futile.","Interstellar"
"398",1832414,1833750,"Where'd you send them?","Interstellar"
"399",1834166,1835585,"Cooper...","Interstellar"
"400",1835751,1838546,"I can't tell you anymoreunless you agree...","Interstellar"
"401",1838712,1840548,"to pilot this craft.","Interstellar"
"402",1840714,1844009,"- You're the best pilot we ever had.- I barely left the stratosphere.","Interstellar"
"403",1844301,1846429,"This team never left the simulator.","Interstellar"
"404",1846762,1850557,"We need a pilot, and this is the missionthat you were trained for.","Interstellar"
"405",1850724,1852226,"Without even knowing it?","Interstellar"
"406",1853269,1856125,"An hour ago, you didn'teven know I was alive.","Interstellar"
"407",1856151,1857548,"You were going anyway.","Interstellar"
"408",1857690,1859400,"We had no choice.","Interstellar"
"409",1859567,1861318,"But something sent you here.","Interstellar"
"410",1861652,1864364,"- They chose you.- Who's ""they""?","Interstellar"
"411",1872329,1874248,"How long would I be gone?","Interstellar"
"412",1874832,1877751,"Hard to know. Years?","Interstellar"
"413",1878461,1880087,"I've got kids, professor.","Interstellar"
"414",1880587,1882632,"Get out there and save them.","Interstellar"
"415",1886009,1887386,"Who's ""they""?","Interstellar"
"416",1887553,1891348,"We started detecting gravitationalanomalies almost 50 years ago.","Interstellar"
"417",1891682,1895310,"Mostly small distortions to our instrumentsin the upper atmosphere.","Interstellar"
"418",1895478,1898605,"In fact, I believeyou encountered one yourself.","Interstellar"
"419",1899272,1901275,"Yeah, over the Straights.","Interstellar"
"420",1902276,1905320,"My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.","Interstellar"
"421",1905488,1906697,"Exactly.","Interstellar"
"422",1907531,1912452,"But of all these anomalies,the most significant is this:","Interstellar"
"423",1912619,1914622,"Out near Saturn...","Interstellar"
"424",1914788,1916874,"a disturbance of space-time.","Interstellar"
"425",1919000,1922130,"- Is that a Wormhole?- It appeared 48 years ago.","Interstellar"
"426",1922587,1924507,"And it leads where?","Interstellar"
"427",1925048,1926675,"Another galaxy.","Interstellar"
"428",1928428,1930680,"A wormhole's nota naturally occurring phenomenon.","Interstellar"
"429",1930846,1932265,"Someone placed it there.","Interstellar"
"430",1933057,1934558,"- ""They""?- Mm.","Interstellar"
"431",1935058,1939146,"And whoever they are,they appear to be looking out for us.","Interstellar"
"432",1939605,1942191,"That Wormhole lets ustravel to other stars.","Interstellar"
"433",1942357,1944277,"It came along right as we needed it.","Interstellar"
"434",1944443,1947363,"They've put potentially habitable worldsright within our reach.","Interstellar"
"435",1947529,1949449,"Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.","Interstellar"
"436",1949615,1951992,"- You sent probes into that?- Mm-hm.","Interstellar"
"437",1952160,1955163,"We sent people into it. Ten years ago.","Interstellar"
"438",1956497,1958165,"The Lazarus missions.","Interstellar"

"443",1968384,1971386,"Each person's landing podhad enough life support for two years.","Interstellar"

"446",1977058,1980896,"Their mission was to assess their world,and if it showed potential...","Interstellar"
"447",1981230,1985651,"then they could send out a signal, beddown for the long nap, wait to be rescued.","Interstellar"
"448",1985817,1987862,"And what if the world didn't show promise?","Interstellar"
"449",1988488,1989905,"Hence the bravery.","Interstellar"

"458",2012345,2013930,"No long shot.","Interstellar"
"459",2016097,2017224,"Okay.","Interstellar"
"460",2017933,2020269,"So if we find a home...","Interstellar"

"689",3105311,3109690,"He inspired 11 people to follow himon the loneliest journey in human history.","Interstellar"
"690",3109858,3111443,"Scientists, explorers.","Interstellar"
"691",3111610,3115697,"That's what I love.You know, out there we face great odds.","Interstellar"
"692",3116197,3117615,"Death, but...","Interstellar"
"693",3119367,3120702,"not evil.","Interstellar"
"694",3120994,3122746,"You don't think nature can be evil?","Interstellar"
"695",3123121,3125789,"No. Formidable. Frightening. But...","Interstellar"
"696",3126583,3128585,"no, not evil.- Hm.","Interstellar"
"697",3129835,3133047,"Is a lion evilbecause it rips a gazelle to shreds?","Interstellar"
"698",3133547,3135550,"Just what we take with us, then.","Interstellar"
"699",3136092,3137135,"Yeah.","Interstellar"
"700",3137552,3139637,"This crew represents the best of humanity.","Interstellar"
"701",3139804,3140972,"Even me, huh?","Interstellar"
"702",3141139,3143141,"You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.","Interstellar"
"703",3143307,3144391,"There you go.","Interstellar"
"704",3144809,3147186,"- Don't stay up.- I'll be there in a minute.","Interstellar"
"705",3147353,3151398,"Just remember, Coop,you are literally wasting your breath.","Interstellar"
"706",3158072,3161242,"Hey, TARS? Let's go over thattrajectory one more time.","Interstellar"
"707",3161576,3163244,"Eight months to Mars.","Interstellar"
"708",3163744,3166581,"Counter-orbital slingshot around.Fourteen months to Saturn.","Interstellar"
"709",3166748,3168166,"Nothing's changed on that.","Interstellar"
"710",3168333,3170418,"Just let me ask you something.","Interstellar"
"711",3172670,3173793,"Dr. Brand and Edmunds...","Interstellar"
"712",3173818,3176157,"Why are you whispering?They can't hear you.","Interstellar"
"713",3177592,3180594,"Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?","Interstellar"
"714",3180762,3182179,"I wouldn't know.","Interstellar"
"715",3182347,3185349,"Is that 90 percent ""wouldn't know""or 10 percent ""wouldn't know""?","Interstellar"
"716",3185516,3188644,"- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.- Aah.","Interstellar"
"717",3190105,3192273,"But not a poker face, Slick.","Interstellar"
"718",3204619,3205869,"Hey, guys.","Interstellar"
"719",3206286,3209373,"Uh, Dad's about to godown for the long nap.","Interstellar"
"720",3209708,3212335,"So I wanted to give you an update.","Interstellar"
"721",3212501,3213628,"Uh...","Interstellar"
"722",3214170,3217882,"The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...","Interstellar"
"723",3218425,3221260,"You can't see any of the dust. Heh.","Interstellar"
"724",3221427,3225556,"Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.","Interstellar"
"725",3225889,3230144,"I know you'll get this message. ProfessorBrand's assured me he'll get it to you.","Interstellar"
"726",3230686,3232731,"Know that I love you.","Interstellar"
"727",3234148,3236483,"- ls it him?- I don't think so, Murph.","Interstellar"
"728",3243365,3245034,"You must be Donald.","Interstellar"
"729",3247244,3248413,"Hello, Murph.","Interstellar"
"730",3249164,3251166,"Why are you in my dad's truck?","Interstellar"
"731",3251791,3253960,"He wanted me to bring it for your brother.","Interstellar"
"732",3254710,3256880,"He sent you a message.","Interstellar"
"733",3259965,3261967,"She's pretty upset with him for leaving.","Interstellar"
"734",3262135,3266222,"If you record any messages,I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.","Interstellar"
"735",3267306,3269976,"Murph is a bright spark.","Interstellar"
"736",3270976,3273521,"Maybe I should fan the flame.","Interstellar"
"737",3273688,3276273,"She's already making fools of her teachers.","Interstellar"
"738",3276440,3279277,"So maybe she should comeand make a fool out of you.","Interstellar"
"739",3280360,3283197,"- So where are they?- Heading for Mars.","Interstellar"
"740",3283907,3287911,"The next time you hear from Cooper,they'll be coming up on Saturn.","Interstellar"
"741",3327867,3329586,"As far as school goes...","Interstellar"
"742",3329744,3332914,"the administration wants meto repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.","Interstellar"
"743",3333414,3336626,"But they said I could startAdvanced Agriculture a year early.","Interstellar"
"744",3338418,3342297,"All right, I got to go, Dad.Hope you're safe up there.","Interstellar"
"745",3346344,3347929,"Um, sorry, Coop.","Interstellar"
"746",3348096,3352934,"I asked Murph to say hi,but she's as stubborn as her old man.","Interstellar"
"747",3353351,3355186,"I'll try again next time.","Interstellar"
"748",3370201,3371786,"You all right, Rom?","Interstellar"
"749",3374121,3375956,"This gets to me, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"750",3376123,3377791,"This. This.","Interstellar"
"751",3378293,3381170,"Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,and then nothing...","Interstellar"
"752",3381336,3385300,"out there for millions of mileswon't kill us in seconds.","Interstellar"
"753",3386217,3388135,"You know that some of the finest...","Interstellar"
"754",3388302,3392139,"solo yachtsmen in the worlddon't know how to swim?","Interstellar"
"755",3392724,3395893,"They don't know how. And if theygo overboard, psst, they're done.","Interstellar"
"756",3397644,3399606,"We're explorers, Rom.","Interstellar"
"757",3401148,3402858,"This is our boat.","Interstellar"
"758",3403025,3404152,"Here.","Interstellar"
"759",3431262,3433014,"This is from the, uh, relay probe?","Interstellar"
"760",3433181,3435224,"It was in orbit around the Wormhole.","Interstellar"
"761",3435724,3438769,"This is the Wormhole,and every time we'd come around...","Interstellar"
"762",3438936,3442148,"we would receive imagesfrom the other side of the foreign galaxy.","Interstellar"
"763",3442481,3444608,"Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.","Interstellar"
"764",3444775,3445860,"Exactly.","Interstellar"
"765",3446027,3450530,"So we got a pretty good idea what we'regonna find on the other side, huh?","Interstellar"
"766",3451615,3452951,"Navigationally.","Interstellar"
"767",3454409,3458164,"Guys? We'll be approachingthe Wormhole in about three hours.","Interstellar"
"768",3464545,3465588,"Hey, Coop?","Interstellar"
"769",3466463,3468215,"Can we stop the spinning?","Interstellar"
"770",3468382,3469467,"Why?","Interstellar"
"771",3469634,3471969,"Because we're close enough to see it now?","Interstellar"
"772",3473804,3474931,"All right.","Interstellar"
"773",3475097,3476181,"Thanks.","Interstellar"
"774",3481938,3483898,"There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!","Interstellar"
"775",3484065,3485858,"Say it, don't spray it, Rom.","Interstellar"
"776",3486233,3487527,"It's a sphere.","Interstellar"
"777",3487693,3491655,"Of course it is. What, you...?You thought it would just be a hole?","Interstellar"
"778",3492864,3495952,"No, it's just that all the illustrationsI've ever seen, they...","Interstellar"
"779",3496494,3499579,"In the illustrations,they're trying to show you how it works.","Interstellar"
"780",3500289,3504126,"So they say you want to gofrom here to there.","Interstellar"
"781",3504460,3507005,"- But it's too far, right?- Mm-hm.","Interstellar"
"782",3507170,3511967,"So a Wormhole bends space like this,so you can take a shortcut through...","Interstellar"
"783",3512300,3513885,"a higher dimension.","Interstellar"
"784",3514052,3515512,"Okay, so...","Interstellar"
"785",3515847,3518271,"to show that, they'veturned three-dimensional","Interstellar"
"786",3518297,3519791,"space into two dimensions...","Interstellar"
"787",3519934,3523896,"which turns a Wormholeinto two dimensions, a circle.","Interstellar"
"788",3524063,3526315,"What's a circle in three dimensions?","Interstellar"
"789",3527525,3529027,"- A sphere.- Exactly.","Interstellar"
"790",3529443,3530945,"A spherical hole.","Interstellar"
"791",3531487,3534322,"But who put it there?Who do we have to thank?","Interstellar"
"792",3534740,3539411,"I'm not thanking anybodyuntil we get out of here in one piece, Rom.","Interstellar"
"793",3546626,3548045,"Any trick to this, Doyle?","Interstellar"
"794",3549380,3551048,"No one knows.","Interstellar"
"795",3558181,3559849,"The others made it, right?","Interstellar"
"796",3561893,3563561,"At least some of them.","Interstellar"
"797",3595510,3598679,"Everybody ready to say goodbyeto our solar system?","Interstellar"
"798",3599554,3601556,"To our galaxy.","Interstellar"
"799",3603476,3604518,"Here we go.","Interstellar"
"800",3637135,3640637,"The controls won't work here.We're passing through the bulk.","Interstellar"
"801",3640804,3645226,"It's space beyond our three dimensions.All you can do is record and observe.","Interstellar"
"802",3656403,3657445,"What is that?","Interstellar"
"803",3659824,3661659,"I think it's them.","Interstellar"
"804",3661992,3663827,"Distorting space-time.","Interstellar"
"805",3665913,3666998,"Don't! Don't!","Interstellar"
"806",3695025,3696277,"What was that?","Interstellar"
"807",3699280,3700780,"The first handshake.","Interstellar"
"808",3702449,3703492,"We're...","Interstellar"
"809",3705119,3706454,"We're here.","Interstellar"
"810",3726806,3729059,"So the lost communications came through.","Interstellar"
"811",3729226,3732103,"- How?- The relay on this side cached them.","Interstellar"
"812",3732271,3735815,"So years of basic data. No real surprises.","Interstellar"
"813",3736733,3740570,"Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,as has Dr. Mann's. Um...","Interstellar"
"814",3740737,3742864,"Edmunds' went down three years ago.","Interstellar"
"815",3743032,3744242,"Transmitter failure?","Interstellar"
"816",3744407,3747411,"Maybe. He was sending the thumbs upright until it went dark.","Interstellar"
"817",3747577,3749338,"But Miller's still looksgood though, right?","Interstellar"
"818",3749496,3751791,"- Because she's coming up fast.Mm-hm.","Interstellar"
"819",3752250,3754251,"With one complication.","Interstellar"
"820",3754668,3757672,"The planet is much closer to Gargantuathan we thought.","Interstellar"
"821",3757838,3760507,"- Gargantua?- It's what we're calling the black hole.","Interstellar"
"822",3760675,3762969,"Miller's and Dr. Mann'splanets both orbit it.","Interstellar"
"823",3763135,3766347,"- And Miller's is on the horizon?- As a basketball around a hoop.","Interstellar"
"824",3766514,3768516,"Landing there takes us dangerously close.","Interstellar"
"825",3768682,3771936,"And a black hole that bighas a huge gravitational pull.","Interstellar"
"826",3774521,3777525,"Look, I could swing around thatneutron star to decelerate.","Interstellar"
"827",3777692,3779568,"No, it's not that. It's time.","Interstellar"
"828",3779735,3784239,"The gravity on that planet will slow ourclock compared to Earth's drastically.","Interstellar"
"829",3784864,3786032,"How bad?","Interstellar"
"830",3786199,3789744,"Every hour we spend onthat planet will be...","Interstellar"
"831",3790621,3792789,"seven years back on Earth.","Interstellar"
"832",3793666,3794708,"Jesus.","Interstellar"
"833",3795041,3796710,"Well, that's relativity, folks.","Interstellar"
"834",3798128,3800588,"Well, we can't just drop downthere without...","Interstellar"
"835",3800755,3802632,"Cooper, we have a mission.","Interstellar"
"836",3802800,3805385,"Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,and our mission Plan A is...","Interstellar"
"837",3805552,3808722,"to find a planet that can habitatethe people that are living on Earth now.","Interstellar"
"838",3808889,3811726,"You can't just think about your family.Now you have to think bigger.","Interstellar"
"839",3811891,3815103,"I am thinking about my familyand millions of other families, okay?","Interstellar"
"840",3815271,3819525,"Plan A does not work if the people on Earthare dead by the time we pull it off.","Interstellar"
"841",3820818,3822485,"No. It doesn't.","Interstellar"
"842",3822820,3824487,"That's why there's a Plan B.","Interstellar"
"843",3826407,3827907,"Okay. Cooper's right.","Interstellar"
"844",3828074,3830059,"We need to think of timeas a resource, like","Interstellar"
"845",3830085,3831936,"oxygen and food. Goingdown will cost us.","Interstellar"
"846",3834289,3835458,"All right, look.","Interstellar"
"847",3836751,3840211,"Dr. Mann's data is promising,but it will take months to get there.","Interstellar"
"848",3840378,3842590,"And Edmunds', it's even further.","Interstellar"
"849",3842757,3844842,"Miller hasn't sent much,but what she has is","Interstellar"
"850",3844867,3846952,"very promising. It'swater, it's organics...","Interstellar"
"851",3847094,3849262,"- You don't find that every day.- No, you don't.","Interstellar"
"852",3849429,3851766,"And just think about the resources,including time...","Interstellar"
"853",3851931,3854434,"that would be spenttrying to get back here.","Interstellar"
"854",3855561,3857355,"- Romilly...- Yeah?","Interstellar"
"855",3857521,3861358,"How far off from Miller's planet do wehave to be to stay out of the time shift?","Interstellar"
"856",3861525,3863193,"Just back from the cusp.","Interstellar"
"857",3863360,3866322,"All right, which is here,just outside of Miller's planet.","Interstellar"
"858",3866489,3868282,"- Right.- Okay.","Interstellar"
"859",3869199,3871994,"Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.","Interstellar"
"860",3872161,3875331,"Instead of taking the Endurance into orbitaround Miller's planet...","Interstellar"
"861",3875498,3878376,"which would conserve fuel,but we would lose a lot of time...","Interstellar"
"862",3878541,3882630,"what if we take a wider orbit aroundGargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...","Interstellar"
"863",3882797,3885298,"outside of this time shift, to here?","Interstellar"
"864",3885465,3888260,"Then we take the Ranger down,we get Miller, we get her samples.","Interstellar"
"865",3888427,3891137,"We come back, we analyze, we debrief.We're in, we're out.","Interstellar"
"866",3891304,3893641,"We lose a little fuel,but we save a whole lot of time.","Interstellar"
"867",3893807,3895643,"- That'll work.- That's good.","Interstellar"
"868",3895809,3898269,"There's no time for monkey businessor chit-chat down there.","Interstellar"
"869",3898436,3901231,"So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.","Interstellar"
"870",3901398,3903650,"CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.","Interstellar"
"871",3903818,3907405,"If we're talking about a couple years,I could use the time to research gravity.","Interstellar"
"872",3907570,3910532,"Observations from the Wormhole,that's gold to Professor Brand.","Interstellar"
"873",3910699,3912378,"TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.","Interstellar"
"874",3912534,3917289,"Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but makesure we stay in range of Miller's planet.","Interstellar"
"875",3917456,3920000,"- You got it?- I wouldn't leave you behind...","Interstellar"
"876",3920166,3921210,"Dr. Brand.","Interstellar"
"877",3925880,3927507,"- You ready, CASE?- Yup.","Interstellar"
"878",3928467,3931971,"- You don't say much, do you?- TARS talks plenty for both of us.","Interstellar"
"879",3933179,3934222,"Detach.","Interstellar"
"880",3941521,3944483,"- Romilly, are you reading these forces?- It's unbelievable.","Interstellar"
"881",3947695,3949822,"A literal heart of darkness.","Interstellar"
"882",3953992,3956704,"If we could just seethe collapsed star inside...","Interstellar"
"883",3956871,3959623,"the singularity, yeah,we'd solve gravity.","Interstellar"
"884",3960039,3963335,"- And we can't get anything from it?- Nothing escapes that horizon.","Interstellar"
"885",3963501,3964836,"Not even light.","Interstellar"
"886",3965003,3967096,"The answer's there,just no way to see it.","Interstellar"
"887",3967121,3968532,"There's Miller's planet.","Interstellar"
"888",3971177,3972510,"Goodbye, Ranger.","Interstellar"
"889",3985315,3987610,"This is fast for atmospheric entry.","Interstellar"
"890",3987775,3990028,"- Should we use the thrusters to slow?- No.","Interstellar"
"891",3990487,3993824,"I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamicsto save some fuel.","Interstellar"
"892",3993990,3995201,"Air brake?","Interstellar"
"893",3995367,3998913,"- We want to get down fast, don't we?- We want to get there in one piece.","Interstellar"
"894",3999079,4002081,"- Hang on.- Brand, Doyle, get ready.","Interstellar"
"895",4017931,4020434,"- We should ease!- Hands where I can see them.","Interstellar"
"896",4020601,4023938,"The only time I went down was when amachine was easing at the wrong time.","Interstellar"
"897",4024103,4024909,"A little caution...","Interstellar"
"898",4024934,4026965,"Can get you killed,like reckless driving.","Interstellar"
"899",4027106,4029275,"- Cooper, it's too damn fast!- I got this.","Interstellar"
"900",4034114,4038117,"- Should I disable the feedback?- No. I need to feel the air.","Interstellar"
"901",4042121,4043289,"Here we go.","Interstellar"
"902",4046585,4047878,"It's just water!","Interstellar"
"903",4049380,4050880,"The stuff of life.","Interstellar"

"1147",5142805,5144306,"we have to choose.","Interstellar"
"1148",5145515,5146643,"But how?","Interstellar"
"1149",5147685,5149354,"They're both promising.","Interstellar"
"1150",5150896,5155400,"Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mannis the one still transmitting, so...","Interstellar"

"1156",5170582,5173920,"- Why?- Gargantua, that's why.","Interstellar"
"1157",5175046,5179091,"Look at Miller's planet.Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...","Interstellar"

"1171",5220006,5224636,"Granted, but Edmunds' datais more promising.","Interstellar"

"1351",6136381,6140217,"But he's been trying to solvethe gravity equation for 40 years.","Interstellar"
"1352",6140719,6144139,"Amelia, your father solved his equationbefore I even left.","Interstellar"
"1353",6144722,6146600,"Then why wouldn't he use it?","Interstellar"
"1354",6146766,6150729,"The equation couldn't reconcile relativitywith quantum mechanics. You need more.","Interstellar"
"1355",6150895,6152814,"More? More what?","Interstellar"
"1356",6152980,6155984,"More data. You needto see into a black hole.","Interstellar"
"1357",6156150,6158235,"The laws of nature prohibita naked singularity.","Interstellar"
"1358",6158403,6159904,"Romilly, is that true?","Interstellar"
"1359",6161198,6164909,"If a black hole is an oyster,then the singularity's the pearl inside.","Interstellar"
"1360",6165077,6167828,"The gravity's so strong,it's always hidden in darkness...","Interstellar"
"1361",6167996,6169413,"behind the horizon.","Interstellar"
"1362",6170832,6172917,"That's why we call it a black hole.","Interstellar"
"1363",6173085,6176505,"Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...","Interstellar"
"1364",6177088,6178590,"We can't, Coop.","Interstellar"
"1365",6178756,6181259,"There are some thingsthat aren't meant to be known.","Interstellar"
"1366",6181592,6185639,"Your father had to find another wayto save the human race from extinction.","Interstellar"
"1367",6185805,6187306,"Plan B. A colony.","Interstellar"
"1368",6187474,6189141,"Why not tell people?","Interstellar"
"1369",6190726,6193814,"- Why keep building those stations?- He knew how hard it would be...","Interstellar"
"1370",6193979,6198109,"to get people to work togetherto save the species instead of themselves.","Interstellar"
"1371",6198275,6199444,"Or their children.","Interstellar"
"1372",6199610,6200654,"Bullshit.","Interstellar"
"1373",6200820,6203614,"You never would've comeunless you believed you would save them.","Interstellar"
"1374",6203782,6206993,"Evolution has yet to transcendthat simple barrier.","Interstellar"
"1375",6207159,6209621,"We can care deeply, selflessly about...","Interstellar"
"1376",6209787,6213291,"those we know, but that empathyrarely extends beyond our line of sight.","Interstellar"
"1377",6213457,6215167,"But the lie.","Interstellar"
"1378",6218462,6220881,"That monstrous lie?","Interstellar"
"1379",6222134,6223426,"Unforgivable.","Interstellar"
"1380",6223592,6225052,"And he knew that.","Interstellar"
"1381",6225804,6230141,"He was prepared to destroy his own humanityin order to save the species.","Interstellar"
"1382",6230307,6232728,"- He made an incredible sacrifice.- No.","Interstellar"
"1383",6234145,6239024,"An incredible sacrifice is being madeby the people on Earth who are gonna die!","Interstellar"
"1384",6239484,6241653,"Because in his fucking arrogance...","Interstellar"
"1385",6242069,6244155,"he declared their case hopeless.","Interstellar"
"1386",6244823,6246323,"I'm sorry, Cooper...","Interstellar"
"1387",6246867,6248326,"their case is hopeless.","Interstellar"
"1388",6248493,6250619,"No. No.","Interstellar"
"1389",6251246,6252747,"We are the future.","Interstellar"
"1390",6256417,6258336,"Cooper, what can I do?","Interstellar"
"1391",6261547,6263382,"Let me go home.","Interstellar"
"1392",6263966,6265886,"You're absolutely positive?","Interstellar"
"1393",6266511,6269014,"His solution was correct.He'd had it for years.","Interstellar"
"1394",6269680,6272309,"- It's worthless?- It's half the answer.","Interstellar"
"1395",6273268,6276270,"Okay, how do you find the other half?","Interstellar"
"1396",6276854,6278523,"Out there? A black hole.","Interstellar"
"1397",6278689,6281525,"- But stuck down here on Earth?- Yeah?","Interstellar"
"1398",6282860,6284529,"I'm not sure you can.","Interstellar"
"1399",6286448,6289117,"God, they just pack up and leave.","Interstellar"
"1400",6290534,6292621,"What are they hoping to find?","Interstellar"
"1401",6293204,6294247,"Survival.","Interstellar"
"1402",6302046,6303131,"Damn it.","Interstellar"
"1403",6306051,6309845,"Murph, don't...?Don't people have a right to know?","Interstellar"
"1404",6310471,6314559,"Panic won't help.We just have to keep working, same as ever.","Interstellar"
"1405",6314725,6318063,"But isn't that exactly what Professor Brandwas manipulating us to do?","Interstellar"
"1406",6318229,6321483,"Brand gave up on us.I'm still trying to solve this.","Interstellar"
"1407",6322108,6323193,"So...","Interstellar"
"1408",6324610,6326279,"do you have an idea?","Interstellar"
"1409",6326988,6328323,"A feeling.","Interstellar"
"1410",6331743,6333744,"I told you about my ghost.","Interstellar"
"1411",6335747,6337791,"My dad thought I called it a ghost...","Interstellar"
"1412",6338250,6339917,"because I was scared of it.","Interstellar"
"1413",6343380,6344713,"But I was never scared of it.","Interstellar"
"1414",6346925,6349594,"I called it a ghost because it felt...","Interstellar"
"1415",6352012,6353681,"It felt like a person.","Interstellar"
"1416",6356225,6357894,"It was trying to tell me something.","Interstellar"
"1417",6360855,6363859,"If there's an answer here on Earth,it's back there...","Interstellar"
"1418",6364317,6366235,"somehow, in that room.","Interstellar"
"1419",6366778,6368529,"So I have to find it.","Interstellar"
"1420",6371949,6373702,"We're running out of time.","Interstellar"
"1421",6375619,6377622,"What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?","Interstellar"
"1422",6377788,6379957,"No, they can stay.I'll be sleeping anyway.","Interstellar"
"1423",6380125,6381710,"- Hey, Coop?- Yeah?","Interstellar"
"1424",6381877,6383878,"I have a suggestion foryour return journey.","Interstellar"
"1425",6384045,6386797,"- Yeah, what's that?- Have one last crack at the black hole.","Interstellar"
"1426",6388675,6390260,"I'm going home, Rom.","Interstellar"
"1427",6390426,6393680,"Yeah, I know.This isn't going to cost you any time.","Interstellar"
"1428",6394430,6396265,"There's a chance for the people on Earth.","Interstellar"
"1429",6397016,6400060,"- Talk to me.- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.","Interstellar"
"1430",6400228,6404106,"- It's what we call a gentle singularity.- Gentle?","Interstellar"
"1431",6404274,6407735,"They're hardly gentle.But the tidal gravity is so quick that...","Interstellar"
"1432",6407903,6412157,"something crossing the horizon fastmight survive. A probe, say.","Interstellar"
"1433",6412323,6416994,"- What happens after it crosses?- After the horizon is a complete mystery.","Interstellar"
"1434",6417162,6420247,"So, what's to saythere isn't some way that the probe...","Interstellar"
"1435",6420414,6423335,"can glimpse the singularityand relay the quantum data?","Interstellar"
"1436",6423501,6426755,"If he's equipped to transmitevery form of energy that can pulse.","Interstellar"
"1437",6426921,6429716,"Just when did this probebecome a ""he,"" professor?","Interstellar"
"1438",6430257,6432010,"TARS is the obvious candidate.","Interstellar"
"1439",6432844,6434762,"I've already told him what to look for.","Interstellar"
"1440",6434930,6437640,"I'd need the old optical transmitteroff KIPP, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"1441",6437806,6439141,"You'd do this for us?","Interstellar"
"1442",6439309,6443229,"Before you get all teary, remember thatas a robot I have to do anything you say.","Interstellar"
"1443",6444146,6445606,"Your cue light's broken.","Interstellar"
"1444",6445774,6447317,"I'm not joking.","Interstellar"
"1445",6449944,6453198,"I'll need TARS to remove and adaptsome components from KIPP.","Interstellar"
"1446",6453364,6455699,"I don't want to disturbhis archival functions.","Interstellar"
"1447",6455867,6457368,"I'll supervise.","Interstellar"
"1448",6457702,6458744,"All right.","Interstellar"
"1449",6458912,6461470,"Dr. Mann, we need tofind three secure sites.","Interstellar"
"1450",6461496,6463608,"One for Brand's lab,two for habitat.","Interstellar"
"1451",6463750,6466211,"Once those modules have landed,you don't want to move them.","Interstellar"
"1452",6466377,6468921,"I can take you to the probe sites,but I don't think...","Interstellar"
"1453",6469088,6471800,"these conditions will hold.I think we should wait.","Interstellar"
"1454",6471966,6474802,"CASE is headed downwith the rest of the distillery equipment.","Interstellar"
"1455",6474970,6477805,"I'd really like to securethose sites by nightfall.","Interstellar"
"1456",6479724,6482810,"Well, these squalls do usually blow over.","Interstellar"
"1457",6483228,6484354,"Okay, then.","Interstellar"
"1458",6484520,6486730,"- You'll need a long-range transmitter.- Got it.","Interstellar"
"1459",6486898,6488440,"- Are you charged?- Yeah.","Interstellar"
"1460",6489024,6490068,"Follow me.","Interstellar"
"1461",6490859,6493029,"TARS, 72 hours, yeah?","Interstellar"
"1462",6493195,6494405,"Roger that, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"1463",6500703,6503747,"Brand told me why you feelyou have to go back.","Interstellar"
"1464",6505582,6508336,"But I'd be remissif I didn't at least mention...","Interstellar"
"1465",6508670,6512841,"that a mission such as ourscould certainly use an extra engineer.","Interstellar"
"1466",6514676,6518930,"You better slow down, turbo.Safety first, CASE, remember.","Interstellar"
"1467",6519555,6521306,"Safety first, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"1468",6522559,6525561,"I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,I'm honored to be a part of this.","Interstellar"
"1469",6525936,6530942,"But once we set up base camp and securethose modules, my work's done here.","Interstellar"
"1470",6531359,6532694,"I'm going home.","Interstellar"
"1471",6540702,6544204,"You have attachments.But even without a family...","Interstellar"
"1472",6544622,6549085,"I can promise you that that yearningto be with other people is powerful.","Interstellar"
"1473",6549752,6553088,"That emotion is at the foundation...","Interstellar"
"1474",6553756,6556801,"of what makes us human.It's not to be taken lightly.","Interstellar"
"1475",6564809,6567395,"- How long have you had that cough?- A while.","Interstellar"
"1476",6577947,6579865,"Mom lets me play in here.","Interstellar"
"1477",6581784,6583036,"I don't touch your stuff.","Interstellar"
"1478",6614024,6615652,"Just take this gently.","Interstellar"
"1479",6620782,6624159,"You know why we couldn't just send machineson these missions, don't you?","Interstellar"
"1480",6624786,6629414,"A machine doesn't improvise wellbecause you can't program a fear of death.","Interstellar"
"1481",6630291,6632627,"Our survival instinct isour single greatest...","Interstellar"
"1482",6632793,6636338,"source of inspiration.Take you, for example.","Interstellar"
"1483",6637047,6638382,"A father...","Interstellar"
"1484",6638882,6641886,"with a survival instinctthat extends to your kids.","Interstellar"
"1485",6643054,6647725,"What does research tell us is the lastthing you're going to see before you die?","Interstellar"
"1486",6649435,6651895,"Your children. Their faces.","Interstellar"
"1487",6652229,6654815,"At the moment of death,your mind's gonna push...","Interstellar"
"1488",6654983,6656693,"a little bit harder to survive.","Interstellar"
"1489",6657402,6658444,"For them.","Interstellar"
"1490",6659319,6660572,"Deep breath.","Interstellar"
"1491",6662865,6666618,"Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.Why don't you have a seat here for me?","Interstellar"
"1492",6666911,6669247,"It's bad. They cannot stay here.","Interstellar"
"1493",6669956,6671248,"- Okay?- Yeah.","Interstellar"
"1494",6679591,6681050,"TARS, what's taking so long?","Interstellar"
"1495",6681216,6684095,"Professor, I am having troublecompleting the boot up.","Interstellar"
"1496",6684261,6685805,"I don't understand.","Interstellar"
"1497",6692604,6693854,"It's funny.","Interstellar"
"1498",6695939,6697567,"When I left Earth...","Interstellar"
"1499",6698568,6700653,"I thought I was prepared to die.","Interstellar"
"1500",6702697,6704032,"The truth is...","Interstellar"
"1501",6706242,6711247,"I never really considered thepossibility that my planet wasn't the one.","Interstellar"
"1502",6713957,6716293,"Nothing worked out the wayit was supposed to.","Interstellar"
"1503",6716461,6717502,"Let's go.","Interstellar"
"1504",6725970,6728765,"All right, buddy, giveme a big deep breath.","Interstellar"
"1505",6733560,6734979,"What is this?","Interstellar"
"1506",6735395,6739234,"- What are you doing? - I'm sorry! Ican't let you leave with that ship.","Interstellar"
"1507",6739567,6741903,"We're gonna need itto complete the mission...","Interstellar"
"1508",6742237,6745657,"once the others realizewhat this place isn't.","Interstellar"
"1509",6745948,6748701,"We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!","Interstellar"
"1510",6749159,6750203,"I'm sorry!","Interstellar"
"1511",6759962,6763091,"- They can't stay here anymore.- You have to leave right now.","Interstellar"
"1512",6763257,6766802,"Let me make something abundantly clear.You have a responsibility...","Interstellar"
"1513",6766970,6770097,"- Oh! Jesus!- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.","Interstellar"
"1514",6770430,6772350,"Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!","Interstellar"
"1515",6772516,6776604,"Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. Andhe's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.","Interstellar"
"1516",6777188,6779856,"You faked all the data?","Interstellar"
"1517",6781567,6782652,"Yeah.","Interstellar"
"1518",6786655,6788365,"There's no surface?","Interstellar"
"1519",6788533,6789701,"No.","Interstellar"
"1520",6790659,6792662,"I tried to do my duty, Cooper...","Interstellar"
"1521",6792828,6797833,"but I knew the day that I arrived herethat this place had nothing.","Interstellar"
"1522",6798458,6802255,"And I resisted the temptation for years...","Interstellar"
"1523",6802880,6804966,"but I knew that...","Interstellar"
"1524",6805300,6808136,"if I just pressed that button, then...","Interstellar"
"1525",6808427,6810430,"somebody would come and save me.","Interstellar"
"1526",6811471,6812974,"You fucking coward.","Interstellar"
"1527",6813807,6814850,"Yes.","Interstellar"
"1528",6820273,6821315,"Yes.","Interstellar"
"1529",6823234,6824277,"Yes.","Interstellar"
"1530",6825528,6826570,"Yes.","Interstellar"
"1531",6838082,6842627,"Listen, if you're not going to go,let your family go. Just save your family.","Interstellar"
"1532",6843128,6845422,"And we go live underground with you?","Interstellar"
"1533",6845590,6847507,"Pray that Daddy comes to save us?","Interstellar"
"1534",6847675,6851179,"Dad's not coming back.He never was coming back. It's up to me.","Interstellar"
"1535",6851345,6853221,"You're gonna save everybody?","Interstellar"
"1536",6853597,6856434,"- Because Dad couldn't do it.- Dad didn't even try!","Interstellar"
"1537",6856600,6858770,"Dad just abandoned us!","Interstellar"
"1538",6859520,6861314,"He left us here to die.","Interstellar"
"1539",6862023,6863690,"Nobody's going with you.","Interstellar"
"1540",6867403,6870113,"You gonna wait for your next kid to die?","Interstellar"
"1541",6873117,6874409,"Get out.","Interstellar"
"1542",6875286,6876621,"And don't come back.","Interstellar"
"1543",6881501,6883336,"You can keep my stuff.","Interstellar"
"1544",6894262,6895640,"Stop it!","Interstellar"
"1545",6898643,6900228,"No. No!","Interstellar"
"1546",6901311,6904189,"Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chanceyou're gonna kill yourself!","Interstellar"
"1547",6905024,6907025,"Those are the best odds I've had in years.","Interstellar"
"1548",6927462,6929297,"Don't judge me, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"1549",6930048,6932301,"You were never tested like I was.","Interstellar"
"1550",6932926,6934386,"Few men have been.","Interstellar"
"1551",6942728,6943895,"You tried your best, Murph.","Interstellar"
"1552",6953405,6954782,"You're feeling it, aren't you?","Interstellar"
"1553",6956451,6958286,"The survival instinct.","Interstellar"
"1554",6959203,6961881,"That's what drove me. It'swhat drives all of us.","Interstellar"
"1555",6961907,6963565,"And it's what's gonna save us.","Interstellar"
"1556",6964708,6968045,"Because I want to save all of us.For you, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"1557",6973216,6976761,"I'm sorry, I can't watch yougo through this. I'm sorry.","Interstellar"
"1558",6977095,6979765,"I thought I could, but I can't.","Interstellar"
"1559",6980850,6983019,"I'm here. I'm here for you.","Interstellar"
"1560",6983310,6985354,"Just listen to my voice, Cooper.","Interstellar"
"1561",6986146,6987481,"I'm right here.","Interstellar"

"11",244307,245714,"Okay.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"12",248116,249971,"There it is.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"13",250037,254064,"This is one of the jungle's mostamazing creatures, the leaf bug.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"14",254166,258640,"In order to protect itself from predators,it disguises itself as a leaf.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"15",264248,267413,"This one's got quite a grip.Come on, little buddy.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"16",267481,268911,"Don't be shy.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"17",271516,273753,"I guess I was mistaken, kids.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"18",273916,277233,"There are obviously no leaf bugsin this area. Even if...","Horton Hears a Who!"
"19",277341,278967,"No, they're on me!","Horton Hears a Who!"

"22",288001,289594,"Uh, okay.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"23",294467,297283,"Then humpfing a ""humpf""was a sour Kangaroo,","Horton Hears a Who!"

"27",308007,309764,"Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"28",309863,311293,"How many times have I told you that","Horton Hears a Who!"
"29",311368,314500,"the jungle is no placeto act like a wild animal.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"30",324876,327266,"My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"31",327341,330124,"And the children are learningso much from him.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"32",330190,333257,"Learning to be a bunchof harebrained half-wits!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"33",333487,336303,"And that's why my Rudyis pouch-schooled.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"34",336688,339307,"So while Kangaroo stood there,sneering a sneer...","Horton Hears a Who!"
"35",339408,341264,"Horton, that was the best timeI've ever had in my life!","Horton Hears a Who!"

"37",343026,346704,"... once again, the speck floatedright by Horton's ear.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"38",348084,350867,"Then he heard it again,just a very faint yelp,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"39",350965,353332,"as if some tiny personwere calling for help.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"40",356918,358228,"And you know what he thought?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"41",358327,360083,"Why, he thought thatthere must be someone","Horton Hears a Who!"
"42",360151,362935,"on top of that small speck of dust!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"43",363001,365238,"Or even a family, it just might be so,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"44",365337,367956,"a family with childrenjust starting to grow.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"45",370811,371891,"I want to live!","Horton Hears a Who!"

"70",511624,514854,"Well, not the speck.I mean, that's ridiculous.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"71",516521,519784,"Is that what you thought I meant?No, the speck can't call out for help.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"72",519883,521989,"Come on, get real.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"73",523404,527114,"No, there's a tiny person on that speckthat needs my help.","Horton Hears a Who!"

"79",543506,545710,"And to them, we're the specks.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"80",545970,547629,"And then, maybe someone elsewill come along and say,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"81",547732,550034,"""Oh, there can't be people that small"",and the first guy would say,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"82",550132,551147,"""Are you calling me a liar?""","Horton Hears a Who!"
"83",551252,553839,"And the second guy would say,""If the shoe fits, wear it!""","Horton Hears a Who!"
"84",553909,556277,"And now the fists are flying,and the first guy picks up a brick,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"85",556374,558961,"and you might want to zip up the pouchfor this next part.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"86",559031,560787,"""All right, fat boy,you want some of this...""","Horton Hears a Who!"

"90",567674,569911,"Really? Oh, my.","Horton Hears a Who!"

"92",573756,575033,"Well...","Horton Hears a Who!"
"93",576093,580218,"If you can't see, hear or feel something,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"94",580286,581912,"it doesn't exist.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"95",582014,584949,"And believing in tiny, imaginary people","Horton Hears a Who!"
"96",585055,589082,"is just not something we do or tolerate,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"97",589184,591094,"here in the jungle of Nool.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"98",591169,595448,"Really? Because I bet if I really tried,I could find somebody who'd believe","Horton Hears a Who!"
"99",595522,597181,"- what I've been saying.- You will do nothing of the sort.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"100",597251,602141,"You will not breathe a word of this lieto anyone else, especially the children.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"101",602213,605891,"I do not want you poisoning their mindswith this nonsense.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"102",606823,609245,"Our community has standards, Horton.","Horton Hears a Who!"

"104",614825,616418,"Have a nice day.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"105",619946,623177,"All right, then,I'll take that under advisement.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"106",623275,624869,"Certainly appreciate your input.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"107",627917,630635,"I don't understand. I know I heard you.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"108",630862,633546,"It was as plain as the nose on my face.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"109",633966,636837,"That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"110",637552,641744,"Of course! Your ears must be tiny.I need to speak up.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"111",644050,647248,"Hello!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"112",647315,649868,"Now some people out there,I think I know who,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"113",649972,652875,"may find they agreewith that sour Kangaroo.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"114",653525,656689,"""There can't really be peopleas small as a mite. ""","Horton Hears a Who!"
"115",656759,661364,"Well, there can, and there are,because Horton was right.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"116",671451,673240,"Hello!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"117",676061,678647,"That single ""hello"" traveledall the way down","Horton Hears a Who!"
"118",678717,682777,"to the speck, through the clouds,until it found a small town.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"119",683423,686457,"A town known as Whoville,for there lived the Whos,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"120",686528,689726,"feeling happy and safe,knowing only good news,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"121",689824,693208,"unaware that their worldwas a speck on a clover,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"122",693282,696217,"unaware that the sweet lifethey knew might be over.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"123",696290,697720,"- Over!- Under!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"124",700420,703323,"The Mayor of Whoville,a man named McDodd,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"125",703429,706878,"was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"126",723307,726657,"The Mayor and his wife,they had children to spare,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"127",726764,730027,"96 daughters, some here and some there.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"128",730926,734604,"96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"129",735759,738793,"but the Mayor had onlya few seconds for each.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"130",739729,742544,"Daddy, I got better than beston my Who-story test.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"131",742641,744682,"Who-story. I remember it well.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"132",744754,746216,"That's one of my girls.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"133",746322,749389,"- Hildy's been using my hairbrush!- Holly's been using my hairbrush!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"134",749492,751085,"Look! Over there!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"135",752117,753579,"There. All better.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"136",753685,757264,"Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?Everyone else in my class has one.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"137",757366,759155,"Oh, really? Everyone?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"138",762232,763639,"I will think about it.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"139",763736,765744,"Daddy, look! Daddy, look!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"140",770394,771442,"Toof.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"141",771515,773425,"It's a ""T-H"", sweetheart. It's ""tooth.""","Horton Hears a Who!"
"142",773916,776306,"In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"143",776412,778998,"the Mayor's oldest is nextin the Mayoral line.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"144",779101,781404,"And who was the oldest?To lead and stand tall?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"145",781501,784536,"It was JoJo, his son,the smallest Who of all.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"146",784607,789529,"So, JoJo, what's shaking?What's happening? What's the word?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"147",790400,792921,"Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear","Horton Hears a Who!"
"148",793025,795961,"that JoJo did not want his father's career.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"149",796451,799648,"But the Mayor pressed forward,completely deluded,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"150",800804,804067,"while JoJo just sat there in silenceand brooded.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"151",807527,809120,"Oh, JoJo!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"152",810471,812414,"- Hey, why does he get more time?- That's not fair.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"153",813448,814822,"Son! Hey!","Horton Hears a Who!"
"154",814889,816318,"And why didn't he speak?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"155",816425,820998,"Well, I think that the lad was afraidif he did, he might let down his dad.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"156",821323,823178,"You know what's awesome?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"157",823275,825064,"This is awesome.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"158",825164,829508,"Just look at the men and womenhanging on these walls.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"159",829837,835273,"You, my boy, are part of a family legacythat spans centuries.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"160",835823,840298,"You know what?Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"161",841553,845744,"and your great-grandmother, that's right,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"162",846194,848683,"all the way down to your","Horton Hears a Who!"

"167",867162,868885,"Be one of the greats.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"168",868954,873232,"I tell you, JoJo, there is nothinglike being Mayor.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"169",873339,877050,"I get to sign resolutions,approve ordinances, submit budgets,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"170",877117,881690,"and in the Edible Parade, I'm the onesitting on top of the giant meatball.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"171",883583,886966,"Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"172",887487,891962,"Someday you'll be the one wearingthe Mayoral Crest.","Horton Hears a Who!"

"182",938544,942440,"We can be a secret society that controlsthe balance of power in the world.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"183",942513,943921,"- Horton.- And no one else can join,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"184",943986,946158,"unless they wear funny hats.","Horton Hears a Who!"

"187",952564,955948,"I am really happy you foundthis speck and all,","Horton Hears a Who!"
"188",957206,960785,"but you might want to thinkabout keeping it to yourself.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"189",961367,962677,"What? Why?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"190",963672,967153,"Well, you're talking to a clover.That doesn't look good.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"191",969594,971504,"You know what doesn't look good?","Horton Hears a Who!"
"192",971610,974677,"You talking about the specklike the speck isn't even there.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"193",974779,977595,"The speck never said anything badabout you.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"194",977693,980628,"But, hey! Good luckwith your illusion of superiority.","Horton Hears a Who!"
"195",980734,985078,"You know, the speck can think anythingit wants about me. It's a speck.","Horton Hears a Who!"

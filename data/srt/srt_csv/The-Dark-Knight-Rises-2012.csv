"316",1644893,1648614,"It used to be funded bythe Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.","The Dark Knight Rises"

"328",1687685,1688778,"Move on.","The Dark Knight Rises"
"329",1689354,1691321,"So after a while,they stop understanding.","The Dark Knight Rises"
"330",1691480,1693357,"They send the angry kid to a boys' home.","The Dark Knight Rises"
"331",1693733,1697534,"I figured it out too late.You gotta learn to hide the anger.","The Dark Knight Rises"
"332",1698238,1700582,"Practice smiling in a mirror.","The Dark Knight Rises"

"344",1741656,1743704,"...but I'm still abeliever in the Batman...","The Dark Knight Rises"
"345",1744534,1746207,"...even if you're not.","The Dark Knight Rises"
"346",1748913,1753840,"Why did you say that your boys' home usedto be funded by the Wayne Foundation?","The Dark Knight Rises"

"366",1823739,1827084,"And not much of any usein your elbows or your shoulders.","The Dark Knight Rises"
"367",1827241,1829619,"Between that and the scar tissueon your kidneys...","The Dark Knight Rises"
"368",1829786,1832460,"...the residual concussive damageto your brain tissue...","The Dark Knight Rises"
"369",1832622,1835296,"...and the general scarred-over qualityof your body...","The Dark Knight Rises"

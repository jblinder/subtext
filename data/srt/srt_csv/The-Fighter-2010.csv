"1381",6169822,6174753,"Well the big challenge for Ward is to get offto a faster start than is customary for him.","The Fighter"
"1382",6174754,6178303,"Micky Ward a notoriously slow starterin big fights.","The Fighter"
"1383",6178313,6180802,"Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.","The Fighter"

"1386",6188278,6191801,"And Neary going to the body,which is Ward's specialty.","The Fighter"
"1387",6192341,6195288,"- Whoa!- Neary bangs Ward to the body.","The Fighter"
"1388",6195312,6199433,"- And a big uppercut by Neary.- Neary leads off with a good left jab.","The Fighter"
"1389",6199439,6203067,"Keeps opponents off balance,jabbing here and there.","The Fighter"
"1390",6205398,6209079,"That was a good left hook by Nearyas he stepped in on Ward.","The Fighter"
"1391",6209090,6213939,"Ward not able to deal with him very wellwhen Neary stands at range like this.","The Fighter"

"1395",6225466,6228309,"Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,","The Fighter"
"1396",6228333,6233333,"and now Neary starts to come onand take the last thirty seconds to the round.","The Fighter"
"1397",6233346,6235776,"- How about that!- Break!","The Fighter"
"1398",6237184,6241845,"Tremendous barrage in the first minute.Just look at this. Unbelievable.","The Fighter"

"1400",6244374,6248450,"Ward is going to have topick up the tempo","The Fighter"
"1401",6248462,6250352,"and beat him with volumes of punching.","The Fighter"
"1402",6250358,6252706,"No doubt Neary is a better boxer.","The Fighter"
"1403",6255821,6260929,"Four hard right handsNeary has belted in the last minute.","The Fighter"
"1404",6260939,6265917,"Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.Surer of what he wants to do.","The Fighter"
"1405",6265928,6269094,"They're standing and trading shotsat the center of the ring.","The Fighter"
"1406",6269106,6272172,"Ward's going to have to step it upa little bit more than he is right now.","The Fighter"
"1407",6272189,6275735,"Micky Ward's corner takinga really deep look at what's going on now,","The Fighter"
"1408",6275758,6278964,"and his family at ringsidewell aware he's stepping up in class.","The Fighter"
"1409",6278981,6282764,"Ward has to got to be more aggressive.","The Fighter"
"1410",6282774,6285473,"He can't just try to wait untileverything is perfect.","The Fighter"
"1411",6285485,6288115,"Despondence over Micky Wardis increasing as the fight goes on","The Fighter"
"1412",6288129,6292249,"because his plan was the right oneand he's executing it.","The Fighter"
"1413",6292268,6299536,"Punches like these make it seemthat it's now Neary's fight.","The Fighter"
"1414",6300986,6306282,"Ward hasn't been in this kind of warwith as strong a fighter as Neary.","The Fighter"
"1415",6307767,6311332,"They are trying to hurt each otherwith only punches.","The Fighter"
"1416",6311339,6316107,"They've tested each other's will,now they're testing each other's skill.","The Fighter"
"1417",6316118,6319558,"And Ward fumbled thereby a right cross from Neary.","The Fighter"
"1418",6319569,6325951,"- Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.- Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.","The Fighter"
"1419",6326766,6332601,"- Vicious body shots from Neary.- And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.","The Fighter"
"1420",6332613,6337580,"I don't know if he can, Jeff.He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.","The Fighter"
"1421",6337581,6341862,"Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.","The Fighter"
"1422",6343568,6345229,"Come on, that's it!","The Fighter"

"1426",6357046,6359179,"This could be it for Micky Ward.","The Fighter"
"1427",6359202,6361855,"Dicky, get him a fucking stoolWhere's the stool?","The Fighter"
"1428",6361867,6364523,"Charlene, will you get the fuckout of here with your high heels?","The Fighter"

"1431",6373580,6378400,"It's Micky Ward against the aggressivenessand clean punching of Shea Neary.","The Fighter"
"1432",6379337,6382730,"If you don't have your defense upyou can really get hurt.","The Fighter"
"1433",6382754,6385460,"He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.","The Fighter"
"1434",6385472,6388266,"I don't think he's going to give it to him,at this rate.","The Fighter"
"1435",6388290,6390309,"This is a survival move.","The Fighter"
"1436",6390331,6394053,"Are you like me? Huh?Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?","The Fighter"

"1448",6434550,6438107,"I'm thinking if he doesn't pick things upthis round and get going,","The Fighter"
"1449",6438124,6442305,"he'll just get totally wiped out.","The Fighter"
"1450",6442310,6444787,"Get off the ropes!Get off the ropes, Mick!","The Fighter"

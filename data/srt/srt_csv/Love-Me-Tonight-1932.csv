"513",2923427,2926987,"Your Grace, with your permission,I'd like to do my hunting indoors today.","Love Me Tonight"
"514",2927388,2930348,"- Indoors?- In your library.","Love Me Tonight"
"515",2930724,2931764,"What the deuce?!","Love Me Tonight"
"516",2931975,2935335,"As much as I love a good gallop,I'm giving it up in your interest.","Love Me Tonight"
"517",2935727,2938087,"Yes, but why all this mystery?","Love Me Tonight"
"518",2939271,2943231,"Concerns the Baron. I've never heard of the Courtelainsin all my historical research. Have you?","Love Me Tonight"
"519",2945317,2949077,"No, but I'm not as familiar as I might bewith the nobility of the South.","Love Me Tonight"
"520",2949487,2953247,"I ran through 8 or 10 volumes before breakfastand found not a Courtelain.","Love Me Tonight"
"521",2954282,2958242,"- Bless my soul.- Mind you, I still have 36 more volumes to look through before I'm sure.","Love Me Tonight"
"522",2958660,2960620,"Yes, but this fellow is a friend of Gilbert's.","Love Me Tonight"
"523",2960953,2963713,"Gilbert I need only remind you is none too choosy.","Love Me Tonight"
"524",2964081,2967241,"Well, you go right ahead, my boy.","Love Me Tonight"
"525",2970961,2974921,"Oh, well, Maurice! You look great!Is that my new riding habit?","Love Me Tonight"
"526",2975547,2978507,"No no, not until you paid for it, Monsieur Vicomte.","Love Me Tonight"
"527",2978883,2982043,"I've been up since daybreak altering it to fit me.","Love Me Tonight"
"528",2983261,2984821,"Have you picked out something good to ride on?","Love Me Tonight"
"529",2985137,2988297,"- The best I could get.- Is it the big gray one?","Love Me Tonight"
"530",2988681,2992241,"- No. Small, orange, with black stripes.- What is it, a zebra?","Love Me Tonight"
"531",2992643,2994003,"No. A bicycle.","Love Me Tonight"
"532",2995353,2998313,"You can't use a bicycle in a hunt.You got to ride a horse.","Love Me Tonight"
"533",2998689,3000649,"But I've never been on a horse in my life.","Love Me Tonight"
"534",3001399,3004919,"Baron, I want to lend you a horse. Thunderbolt.","Love Me Tonight"
"535",3005193,3007713,"- Thunderbolt?- He's fast, but furious.","Love Me Tonight"
"536",3008070,3012430,"I think I'd better not. You see,the harder the horse, the harder I get.","Love Me Tonight"
"537",3012865,3015825,"I might hurt Thunderbolt.","Love Me Tonight"
"538",3016201,3017881,"Oh, he can take it.","Love Me Tonight"
"539",3018077,3021037,"Oh Baron. I took the liberty ofchoosing a horse for you.","Love Me Tonight"
"540",3021413,3025373,"That's so kind of you. I won't needyour Thunderbolt. What's my horse's name?","Love Me Tonight"
"541",3025791,3028151,"- Solitude.- Oh... Solitude.","Love Me Tonight"
"542",3028501,3030461,"Well. Good hunting.","Love Me Tonight"
"543",3030795,3033635,"Solitude sounds just my type.","Love Me Tonight"
"544",3033880,3036280,"Do you know why they call him Solitude?","Love Me Tonight"
"545",3036632,3038792,"Because he always come home alone.","Love Me Tonight"
"546",3039134,3042694,"Solitude for Baron Courtelain!","Love Me Tonight"
"547",3044971,3048931,"What's the point in giving the Barona horse like that?","Love Me Tonight"
"548",3049349,3051309,"I want to test the Baron.","Love Me Tonight"
"549",3051643,3053563,"I can think of several better ways to do that.Let me try.","Love Me Tonight"
"550",3053936,3056856,"Don't bother. Tell me, do you ever think ofanything but men, dear?","Love Me Tonight"
"551",3057272,3059232,"- Oh, yes. - Like what?- Schoolboys.","Love Me Tonight"
"552",3067362,3069482,"I know that's Solitude.","Love Me Tonight"
"553",3069864,3073824,"That's only Thunderbolt.There's Solitude.","Love Me Tonight"
"554",3120941,3123181,"Gilbert! He's not going to...Oh Gilbert! Don't let him!","Love Me Tonight"
"555",3128989,3130349,"Oh, Gilbert!","Love Me Tonight"
"556",3274592,3276512,"Stand back! Stand back!","Love Me Tonight"
"557",3288977,3291097,"What is this?","Love Me Tonight"
"558",3292104,3295624,"This? This is oats, Madame. Very wild.","Love Me Tonight"
"559",3296065,3299385,"And this is the stag. Very tired.","Love Me Tonight"
"560",3300860,3302980,"And where's Solitude?","Love Me Tonight"
"561",3303362,3308282,"We agreed to separate.He went home. Alone.","Love Me Tonight"
"562",3310242,3312362,"And what are your plans?","Love Me Tonight"
"563",3312744,3316664,"Oh, very simple, Madame.After supper, the stag will go right to bed.","Love Me Tonight"
"564",3317122,3319442,"He's had a hard day.","Love Me Tonight"
"565",3319832,3322352,"And the hunt just stops, I suppose...","Love Me Tonight"
"566",3322751,3324871,"A very happy ending, Madame.Which we both approve.","Love Me Tonight"
"567",3325253,3327173,"I do not approve.","Love Me Tonight"
"568",3327546,3329866,"I mean, the stag and myself.","Love Me Tonight"
"569",3330256,3334576,"No true nobleman would mock the tradition of the hunt like this.There are things too fine, too sacred, to be made ridiculous.","Love Me Tonight"
"570",3335260,3336980,"Oh, Your Highness is losing your temper.","Love Me Tonight"
"571",3337345,3341265,"I'm not losing my temper!You let that stag go!","Love Me Tonight"
"572",3341723,3344643,"He'd be caught. And killed.You wouldn't want that, Madame.","Love Me Tonight"
"573",3345058,3347178,"Look... Look at those eyes.","Love Me Tonight"
"574",3355274,3357794,"You are not a gentleman.","Love Me Tonight"
"575",3358193,3360713,"- You need some lessons.- And you, Your Highness, are not a woman.","Love Me Tonight"
"576",3361528,3365448,"You need some lessons too. You know too much abouthunting, etiquette, tradition...","Love Me Tonight"
"577",3365906,3369826,"You know nothing aboutstyle, charm... love.","Love Me Tonight"
"578",3371118,3374638,"Look, your riding habit...","Love Me Tonight"
"579",3375080,3378200,"It's not graceful,it's not [...]","Love Me Tonight"
"580",3378624,3382544,"And your hair. It's too prim, Madame.It's to severe.","Love Me Tonight"
"581",3383002,3386922,"But your riding habit...It's discouraging.","Love Me Tonight"
"582",3388005,3389925,"What are you doing now?","Love Me Tonight"
"583",3390299,3393019,"I'm thinking...I'm thinking about you without these clothes.","Love Me Tonight"
"584",3393426,3395146,"Open your eyes, at once!","Love Me Tonight"
"585",3395511,3397431,"Oh no, pardon, Madame.I mean, with different clothes.","Love Me Tonight"
"586",3399055,3400975,"- Smart clothes.- Here they are...","Love Me Tonight"
"587",3401348,3404268,"- The clothes?- The hunt.","Love Me Tonight"
"588",3414691,3416611,"What's the meaning of this?","Love Me Tonight"
"589",3417818,3421458,"- The stag, the stag, he's asleep.- What?!","Love Me Tonight"
"590",3422613,3424533,"Shh! We must go back, he's very tired.","Love Me Tonight"
"591",3428451,3430571,"Go back, quickly and quietly.","Love Me Tonight"
"592",3432412,3436332,"Go back! Quickly and quietly!","Love Me Tonight"
"593",3436790,3438710,"On tiptoe.","Love Me Tonight"
"594",3451801,3453521,"Madame.","Love Me Tonight"
"595",3470355,3472075,"Good hunting?","Love Me Tonight"
"596",3472440,3476360,"No luck. The Baron and the deer made friendsand called the whole thing off.","Love Me Tonight"
"597",3476818,3480618,"Well I've had good hunting.There's no such title as Baron de Courtelain.","Love Me Tonight"
"598",3480946,3483106,"What?! Gilbert, did you hear that?Are you sure?","Love Me Tonight"
"599",3485158,3487878,"I've even been through the better classillegitimates.","Love Me Tonight"
"600",3488285,3491205,"- And still no Courtelain?- Not a Courtelain.","Love Me Tonight"
"601",3491620,3493940,"Gilbert, who the deuce is your friend?","Love Me Tonight"
"602",3494331,3497691,"Well, uncle, I don't think I'd better tell you.It wouldn't be safe.","Love Me Tonight"
"603",3498292,3499812,"Wouldn't be safe?","Love Me Tonight"
"604",3500168,3502088,"You see, I owe Maurice something...","Love Me Tonight"
"605",3502420,3503580,"You owe him something?!","Love Me Tonight"
"606",3503921,3507441,"Uncle, you shouldn't keep repeatingeverything I say. You live the life of an echo.","Love Me Tonight"
"607",3508090,3510010,"Will you kindly come to the point.","Love Me Tonight"
"608",3510863,3514723,"Uncle, we live in an age of toppling thrones...","Love Me Tonight"
"609",3515179,3519499,"of uneasy crowns, of persecuted royalty","Love Me Tonight"
"610",3520182,3523102,"compelled at times to travel under strange names.Right?","Love Me Tonight"
"611",3523935,3526055,"Are you trying to hint that your friend is royalty?","Love Me Tonight"
"612",3528105,3529625,"Well, I...","Love Me Tonight"
"613",3529939,3532299,"He has the Hapsburg lip.","Love Me Tonight"
"614",3532691,3535411,"And the name Baron Courtelain is...","Love Me Tonight"
"615",3536652,3539772,"A mere nom de pullman.","Love Me Tonight"
"616",3544992,3550512,"","Love Me Tonight"
"617",3591441,3594801,"Well, we're all here except the Baron.","Love Me Tonight"
"618",3595235,3597955,"- Good, then we're all here.- Count, could you do something to entertain?","Love Me Tonight"
"619",3598363,3600283,"No, I'm helpless since my accident.","Love Me Tonight"
"620",3600614,3602574,"- Accident?- I fell flat on my flute.","Love Me Tonight"
"621",3606493,3607613,"Ah, Emperor.","Love Me Tonight"
"622",3611288,3613208,"Have you seen Valentine, uncle?","Love Me Tonight"
"623",3613582,3615902,"Why no, she's not here either. The Baronand Valentine are both missing.","Love Me Tonight"
"624",3616917,3620837,"It's dangerous to invite guests with agirl like that around. Somebody will sue us.","Love Me Tonight"
"625",3621713,3623433,"Ah, there you are.","Love Me Tonight"
"626",3623756,3627716,"The Baron will be down in a moment.He had to send to Paris for his costume.","Love Me Tonight"
"627",3628175,3630295,"I've been watching him put it on.","Love Me Tonight"
"628",3630677,3632597,"You've been what?!","Love Me Tonight"
"629",3634597,3638597,"It's all right, uncle, she has the room next to Maurice.And she's bored holes in the connecting door.","Love Me Tonight"
"630",3639850,3641170,"Valentine!","Love Me Tonight"
"631",3642519,3644279,"Are you aware...?","Love Me Tonight"
"632",3644604,3646564,"Are you... Are you...","Love Me Tonight"
"633",3647773,3651693,"Are you aware that that doorhas come down to us through generations?","Love Me Tonight"

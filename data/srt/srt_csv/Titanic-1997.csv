"162",915653,918121,"You actually think this is you, Nana?","Titanic"
"163",918253,919732,"It is me, dear.","Titanic"
"164",920493,922051,"Wasn't I a dish?","Titanic"
"165",923933,926571,"I tracked it downthrough insurance records.","Titanic"
"166",926652,930327,"An old claim that was settledunder terms of absolute secrecy.","Titanic"
"167",931332,934051,"Can you tell mewho the claimant was, Rose?","Titanic"
"168",934332,936926,"I should imagine someone named Hockley.","Titanic"
"169",937252,940483,"Nathan Hockley. That's right.Pittsburgh steel tycoon.","Titanic"
"170",941292,945843,"The claim was for a diamond necklacehis son, Caledon, bought his fianc�e, you.","Titanic"
"171",946692,949081,"A week before he sailed on Titanic.","Titanic"
"172",949932,952446,"It was filed right after the sinking.","Titanic"
"173",952972,956122,"So the diamond had to have gone downwith the ship.","Titanic"
"174",957372,958771,"You see the date?","Titanic"
"175",960211,961769,"""April 14, 1912.""","Titanic"
"176",961931,964650,"Which means if your grandmotheris who she says she is...","Titanic"
"177",964731,967928,"she was wearing the diamondthe day the Titanic sank.","Titanic"
"178",968011,970571,"And that makes you my new best friend.","Titanic"
"179",971691,975001,"These are some of the thingswe recovered from your stateroom.","Titanic"
"180",977211,978610,"This was mine.","Titanic"
"181",980091,981649,"How extraordinary!","Titanic"
"182",982691,986047,"And it looks the same as it didthe last time I saw it.","Titanic"
"183",991491,993720,"The reflection has changed a bit.","Titanic"
"184",1009890,1012279,"Are you ready to go back to Titanic?","Titanic"
"185",1015690,1018999,"Here we go.She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.","Titanic"
"186",1019530,1024125,"She kind of bumps along, punching holeslike Morse code along the side...","Titanic"
"187",1024209,1025722,"below the water line.","Titanic"
"188",1025809,1027879,"Then the forward compartmentsstart to flood.","Titanic"
"189",1027969,1031803,"Now, as the water level rises,it spills over the watertight bulkheads...","Titanic"
"190",1031889,1034926,"which, unfortunately,don't go any higher than E deck.","Titanic"
"191",1035009,1039161,"So now, as the bow goes down,the stern rises up, slow at first...","Titanic"
"192",1039249,1043640,"then faster and faster, until finally,she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.","Titanic"
"193",1043729,1047119,"And that's a big ass.We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.","Titanic"
"194",1047489,1050049,"Okay? And the hull's not designed to dealwith that pressure.","Titanic"
"195",1050129,1053644,"So what happens?She splits, right down to the keel...","Titanic"
"196",1054048,1056244,"and the stern falls back level.","Titanic"
"197",1056889,1061564,"Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the sternvertical and then finally detaches.","Titanic"
"198",1062528,1066840,"Now the stern section kind of bobs therelike a cork for a couple of minutes...","Titanic"
"199",1066928,1069522,"floods, and finally goes underabout 2:20 a. m...","Titanic"
"200",1069608,1072406,"two hours and 40 minutesafter the collision.","Titanic"
"201",1073248,1077127,"The bow section planes away,landing about a half a mile away...","Titanic"
"202",1077208,1080120,"going 20, 30 knotswhen it hits the ocean floor.","Titanic"
"203",1083567,1084920,"Pretty cool, huh?","Titanic"
"204",1085007,1088795,"Thank you for that fine forensic analysis,Mr. Bodine.","Titanic"
"205",1090287,1092596,"Of course, the experience of it...","Titanic"
"206",1093847,1095678,"was somewhat different.","Titanic"
"207",1096407,1098318,"Will you share it with us?","Titanic"
"208",1150685,1152836,"- I'm taking her to rest.- No.","Titanic"
"209",1153045,1154842,"- Come on, Nana.- No!","Titanic"
"210",1159765,1161676,"Give me the tape recorder.","Titanic"
"211",1163925,1165358,"Tell us, Rose.","Titanic"
"212",1167365,1169003,"It's been 84 years.","Titanic"
"213",1169445,1172915,"It's okay. Just try to remember anything,anything at all.","Titanic"
"214",1173765,1176563,"Do you want to hear this or not,Mr. Lovett?","Titanic"
"215",1180524,1183243,"It's been 84 years...","Titanic"
"216",1185044,1187512,"and I can still smell the fresh paint.","Titanic"
"217",1189684,1191800,"The china had never been used.","Titanic"
"218",1192924,1195313,"The sheets had never been slept in.","Titanic"
"219",1197484,1200840,"Titanic was called the ship of dreams.","Titanic"
"220",1202324,1203598,"And it was.","Titanic"
"221",1204644,1206077,"It really was.","Titanic"
"222",1234803,1238955,"All third-class passengerswith a forward berth...","Titanic"
"223",1239043,1241841,"this way, please! This queue! Right here...","Titanic"
"224",1241923,1244915,"- It's a big boat, huh?- Daddy, it's a ship.","Titanic"
"225",1245003,1246401,"You're right.","Titanic"
"226",1274682,1277276,"I don't see what all the fuss is about.","Titanic"
"227",1277521,1279877,"It doesn't look any biggerthan the Mauretania.","Titanic"
"228",1279961,1283192,"You can be blas� about some things, Rose,but not about Titanic.","Titanic"
"229",1283281,1287240,"It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania,and far more luxurious.","Titanic"
"230",1287361,1290512,"Your daughter is far too difficultto impress, Ruth.","Titanic"
"231",1290681,1292876,"So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.","Titanic"
